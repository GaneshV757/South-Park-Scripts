0,16,4,Sheila Broflovski,"[talking to someone] Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner. [Kyle takes his bowl and heads to the dining table] Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.[he walks past the living room, where Cartman and Sheila are shown talking]"
1,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?"
2,16,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday."
3,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? [Kyle stops and starts listening]"
4,16,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. [Kyle rushes to the entrance]"
5,16,4,Eric Cartman,"So interesting, wow. [he and Sheila are drinking tea]"
6,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Cartman, angrily] Get out of here."
7,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hey, Kyle."
8,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,Get. Outta here! [points his finger to the left]
9,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton."
10,16,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, you're very welcome."
11,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,[walks to him] What are you gonna do?
12,16,4,Eric Cartman,Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
13,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,No?
14,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright, Kyle, listen. [comes forward with Kyle, then sighs] Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park."
15,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,What does that have to do with Passover?
16,16,4,Eric Cartman,"All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever. [Cartman announces the special within the episode] ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! [creepy music plays]"
17,16,4,The Easter Egg Hunt Attendant,"Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt? [Stan is in the front of the line]"
18,16,4,Butters Stotch,[at the middle of the line] Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
19,16,4,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday."
20,16,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Me, too.)"
21,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[anxious] Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all."
22,16,4,Craig Tucker,Jewpa what?
23,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything."
24,16,4,Craig Tucker,"Okay. [to Token and Kenny] So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?"
25,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter."
26,16,4,Butters Stotch,"You mean it's like, like a monster?"
27,16,4,Eric Cartman,"It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls..."
28,16,4,Token Black,Nuh-uh!
29,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[angrily points at him] Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!"
30,16,4,Clyde Donovan,"[offscreen] You guys, check this out! [Butters, Kenny, Craig and Token go there to take a look. On the ground lies a dead bird.]"
31,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[keeps the boys away] Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell."
32,16,4,Butters Stotch,"AAAAAAHHH! [scared as hell, flees]"
33,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing."
34,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies."
35,16,4,Eric Cartman,I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
36,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
37,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch."
38,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[sighs] If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!"
39,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up. [a loud peal of thunder] It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways."
40,16,4,Eric Cartman,[standing on his bed with camera kit attached to him] Butters.
41,16,4,Butters Stotch,AAAAAHHH!
42,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera."
43,16,4,Butters Stotch,"No, it's a school night!"
44,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro! [Butters stammers a bit] I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real."
45,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in."
46,16,4,Butters Stotch,You think Jewpacabra is here?
47,16,4,Eric Cartman,Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
48,16,4,Butters Stotch,Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
49,16,4,Eric Cartman,"You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ. [a rustle comes through the bush] Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING! [to Butters] He's here somewhere."
50,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh God, I'm scared."
51,16,4,Eric Cartman,JESUS IS A LIE!
52,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Eric, stop it!"
53,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Shh! Help me call it out, Butters."
54,16,4,Butters Stotch,I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
55,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?! [Butters thinks] THERE IS NO CHRIST!"
56,16,4,Butters Stotch,Jesus is a lie?
57,16,4,Eric Cartman,"No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?"
58,16,4,Butters Stotch,Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
59,16,4,Eric Cartman,Sh! You hear that?
60,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh, hamburgers."
61,16,4,President,We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!
62,16,4,Eric Cartman,"I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video. [connects his video camera to the TV] What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra. [moves away a bit] And you're the first to see it. [the video shot of Butters and Cartman from last night is played on the TV] This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this. [pauses] 'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for... [an abrupt rustle] right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again. [plays that moment again] Wait for it... wait... there! [pauses to show the motion blurred animal that moves between bushes] Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us."
63,16,4,Employee 1,That wasn't a dog?
64,16,4,Eric Cartman,"It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins."
65,16,4,Employee 2,What?
66,16,4,Eric Cartman,"I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. [the president walks to the window. Employee 1 follows him]"
67,16,4,Employee 1,Mr. Billings?
68,16,4,Mr Billings,"[sighs] There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?"
69,16,4,Peters and Other Sooper Foods Employees,I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%.
70,16,4,Mr Billings,[deep sigh] We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs.
71,16,4,Mr Billings,So where are we heading first?
72,16,4,Eric Cartman,"We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. [points on the map]"
73,16,4,Mr Billings,The Bahamas?
74,16,4,Eric Cartman,That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
75,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! [drops in a pool, then comes out]"
76,16,4,Mr Billings,Where to now?
77,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Now we head back to Colorado, here. [points on the map] We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it."
78,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
79,16,4,Eric Cartman,"People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron."
80,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid."
81,16,4,Eric Cartman,"These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!"
82,16,4,Matt,Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right. [highlights the blurred image of the supposed Jewpacabra]
83,16,4,Cliff,"It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo?"
84,16,4,Bobo,Bobo thinks scary!
85,16,4,Matt,It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch.
86,16,4,Cliff,It's not big enough to be a Squatch.
87,16,4,Matt,So it's a baby Squatch?
88,16,4,Cliff,That's what I'm thinking.
89,16,4,Eric Cartman,I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
90,16,4,Matt,Jewpacabra?
91,16,4,Eric Cartman,"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy."
92,16,4,Bobo,"Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary!"
93,16,4,Cliff,"But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left."
94,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified."
95,16,4,Mr Billings,All the kids will be so disappointed.
96,16,4,Bobo,"Whoa, look at this! I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video! It's all orangie! [the image of Jewpacabra is colored in orange]"
97,16,4,Cliff,But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!
98,16,4,Eric Cartman,Heh. What do you mean? [he is stunned]
99,16,4,Cliff,We've never seen this before! It really is true!
100,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?"
101,16,4,Matt,No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it... [drops an cut-out image of a dog] That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it.
102,16,4,Bobo,That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals!
103,16,4,Matt,"That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell."
104,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive."
105,16,4,Matt,"I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave."
106,16,4,Eric Cartman,Why?
107,16,4,Cliff,'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that.
108,16,4,Matt,"If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you. [Cartman is scared a lot. Creepy music plays]"
109,16,4,Eric Cartman,"There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real. [loud thunder] Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah. [quickly makes a call with his cellphone] Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real? [Kyle is listening to him in his bed with his eyes half-closed] I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?"
110,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing?
111,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? [Kyle hangs up and goes back to sleep. His phone rings again, causing him so throw it to the wall.]"
112,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect

 [speaks on his radio] Everything still clear out there?"
113,16,4,Eric Cartman,[voice only] Guys?!
114,16,4,Butters Stotch,"It's all quiet out front, Eric."
115,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!"
116,16,4,Butters Stotch,"He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. [a boom breaks out. The three boys take to their heels, screaming]"
117,16,4,Eric Cartman,[in the church] What? What was that? Butters? Token?! [the door is forced] Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh! [quickly hides between the candle stands] You guys?! GUYS!
118,16,4,Butters Stotch,"[though the radio] Hey, Eric."
119,16,4,Eric Cartman,It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
120,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. [he is definitely at Wingstreet, and Craig and Token are buying some meal]"
121,16,4,Eric Cartman,Wingstreet?!
122,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide."
123,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I want wings! [there is some knocking on another door] Ahghgh!!! [it turns out to be Mr. Billings and his two employees.] Oh Jesus, it's only you!"
124,16,4,Mr Billings,"Alright, grab him."
125,16,4,Eric Cartman,HUH?!
126,16,4,Employee 3,"You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you. [the two employees take him away]"
127,16,4,Eric Cartman,Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
128,16,4,Mr Billings,"Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice."
129,16,4,Eric Cartman,"OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME! [Employee 3 brushes his face with the blood of a chicken which is in the bucket he holds] What the-?"
130,16,4,Mr Billings,Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
131,16,4,Eric Cartman,This isn't safe or fun!
132,16,4,Mr Billings,"Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay? [a howl is heard] Oh fuck, we better get out of here. [Mr. Billings and his employees flee away]"
133,16,4,Eric Cartman,"NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!"
134,16,4,Mr Billings,"Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company. [Kyle just looks] But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you. [the three walk away. Kyle looks behind them]"
135,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[smiles] Kyle! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks at him with his eyes half-closed] I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance."
136,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go."
137,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble! [Kyle frowns and walks away] No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money! [softly] Oh God, what am I doing? [shouts] I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke! [softly] Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble."
138,16,4,Eric Cartman,It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome. [he is peeked by a pair of red slanted eyes with a snoring effect.] I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! [the pair of eyes turn out to be binoculars used by Bobo.]
139,16,4,Cliff,"What'dya think, Bobo?"
140,16,4,Bobo,No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man!
141,16,4,Matt,I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo!
142,16,4,Bobo,"Bobo shoot it! [he comes forward to aim, Cartman notices]"
143,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Bobo?! Bobo, no! [Bobo fires a dart] Wha- [falls over]"
144,16,4,Bobo,[dances cheerfully] Bobo got it! Bobo got the bunnymaaan!
145,16,4,Matt,"Good shot, Bobo!"
146,16,4,Cliff,Now what do we do?
147,16,4,Matt,I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet.
148,16,4,Cliff,Good idea. [they start walking] Wait wait wait wait. We're gonna need to take the evidence.
149,16,4,Bobo,Alright. [takes the dart gun] I got the evidence right here. The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with.
150,16,4,Matt,"Alright! Come on, let's go!"
151,16,4,Eric Cartman,[seems to be having a dream] Ugh... what... where...
152,16,4,Eric Cartman,Ugh... what? [stands up] What's going on?
153,16,4,Man 1,The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
154,16,4,Eric Cartman,"It's raining frogggggsss! [finds Kyle, who is clinbing to the roof of his house on a ladder] Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?"
155,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,[bangs a nail into a piece of wood] Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
156,16,4,Eric Cartman,"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle."
157,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!"
158,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind."
159,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
160,16,4,Eric Cartman,What does that mean?
161,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
162,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?"
163,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's just how God is.
164,16,4,Eric Cartman,"You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! [Kyle gets angry]"
165,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?"
166,16,4,Pharaoh,"It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear."
167,16,4,Eric Cartman,"But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave."
168,16,4,Pharaoh,"[sighs] It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA?"
169,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. [a bloody frog lands over the edge]"
170,16,4,Pharaoh,Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.
171,16,4,Eric Cartman,"But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys."
172,16,4,Pharaoh,"Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children."
173,16,4,Eric Cartman,"I love you, dad."
174,16,4,Pharaoh,And I love you son. And our love grows.
175,16,4,Eric Cartman,And our love grows
176,16,4,Both,"And our love grows
Like the mighty river of the Nileriver of the Nile
See it flow
We'll never be apart"
177,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children

 [he pats a lamb, but it is taken away by Gerald] Huh? [Sheila slices the lamb's head] Nooooooo! [Sheila and Gerald apply the lamb's blood to their door. Kyle watches them] Kyle, why? What are you doing?"
178,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,This is what God told us to do!
179,16,4,Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle! I don't believe you!"
180,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,You'll see! [Cartman runs away but realizes other families are also doing it. He runs though the corpses of lambs]
181,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Noooo! [goes inside somewhere, but sees two kids with bloody eyes]"
182,16,4,Kid 1,What's happening to us? [both of the kids puke blood and fall over]
183,16,4,Eric Cartman,Noooooo! [runs past a mom and her child]
184,16,4,Child,Mom! Don't let God kill me! [his head explodes and his mom screams]
185,16,4,Eric Cartman,Noooo! [he is confronted by a man]
186,16,4,Man 2,[holds out a flat sandwich] Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
187,16,4,Eric Cartman,No! The bread's all flat! No! [shoves the bread down and keeps running] Aaaaahhhh! [the Pharaoh has kneeled down. All children around him have their heads explode. Screaming and shouting can be heard in the background]
188,16,4,Pharaoh,Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG!
189,16,4,Eric Cartman,"We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! [his head explodes, and the Pharaoh crys in despair]"
190,16,4,Eric Cartman,[sleeptalking] No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
191,16,4,Mr Billings,"There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number... [looks on his paper] 4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin. [The woman employee cuts the ribbon to allow chilren to the hunt. They excitedly run all over the place looking for eggs. Some of them attack and fight each other.]"
192,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[offscreen] I'm alive! [everyone stops. Cartman runs in, gasping for air.] I'm alive, you guys. [holds a blond girl though her shoulders] I don't know how, but I'm alive! [lets go and keeps running] Can you believe it? It's a miracle. [runs to the stage] Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ."
193,16,4,Butters Stotch,"[angrily] Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! [the crowd agrees, then resumes their hunting]"
194,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey guys, listen! [nobody cares. He finds Kyle standing there, approaches him, and lets out a deep sigh.] I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe."
195,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
196,16,4,Eric Cartman,I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
