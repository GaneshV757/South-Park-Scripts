0,16,8,Dan,"[describing the action on the field] Artonius Jackson catches the ball [Jackson makes his way around a group of players], he's running down the sideline- [Jackson gets tackled to the ground by #48] Ohhhh!"
1,16,8,Randy Marsh,BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
2,16,8,Dan,"Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up. [once he's up, he dusts himself off.]"
3,16,8,Randy Marsh,That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
4,16,8,"Voice-Over, Announcer, Commentator","Yeah, Jackson took a real shot and... [Jackson dusts himself off and turns around] well I'm not sure what he's doing now, but uh, it appears as if he's looking for his keys, Dan."
5,16,8,Dan,"Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license."
6,16,8,"Voice-Over, Announcer, Commentator","Coach Martin is coming over to tell him that now, but Jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home. [the coach tries to get his attention]"
7,16,8,Dan,"Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?"
8,16,8,Roger Goodell,"Well, there certainly are interesting statistics coming out, Dan, and we are deeply concerned, anduh and waiting to see if there's... really any direct correlation between football and head trauma."
9,16,8,Dan,"Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors [fat, but the most lucid of the alumni. He stops and waves to the crowd], and fullback Jim Harris. Looks like his pants are down around his ankles. [Harris stops and waves]"
10,16,8,"Voice-Over, Announcer, Commentator","Somebody should let him know. Oh, and Old Surehand Mike Tafthill [a black alumnus who's stooped and walking slowly holding an imaginary tray], who seems to be baking an imaginary cake, Dan."
11,16,8,Dan,"Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something."
12,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it."
13,16,8,Stan Marsh,"You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports."
14,16,8,Butters Stotch,"That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking."
15,16,8,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Butters."
16,16,8,Dan,And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
17,16,8,Randy Marsh,"All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays."
18,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,We don't have kickoffs anymore. [only the TV is heard for a few seconds]
19,16,8,Randy Marsh,[looks at Kyle] Huh?
20,16,8,Stan Marsh,"The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore."
21,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[stands up as his eyes widen to saucers] Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!"
22,16,8,Principal Victoria,"[flanked by Mr. Adler and Mr. Mackey] Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?"
23,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?"
24,16,8,Mr Mackey,"Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?"
25,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[becoming sarcastic] Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!"
26,16,8,Mr Adler,Bras?
27,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! [other parents look at each other and whisper amongst themselves]"
28,16,8,Linda Stotch,How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
29,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!"
30,16,8,Mr Mackey,Huh. You you think the students would like that?
31,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it ""sarcastaball""?!"
32,16,8,Mr Mackey,"Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?"
33,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[angry that no one is with him on this - that is, that no one has caught on to his sarcasm] Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!"
34,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, do we really have to wear bras?"
35,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. [thumbs up]"
36,16,8,Butters Stotch,"I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?"
37,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it."
38,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh, [passing Clyde and Kevin] you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!"
39,16,8,Principal Victoria,"[walks up to Randy] How's it going, coach?"
40,16,8,Randy Marsh,How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
41,16,8,Principal Victoria,So you're happy with these changes?
42,16,8,Randy Marsh,Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
43,16,8,Principal Victoria,[surveys the situation and decides to leave] Okay. [The boys are still hugging each other and Randy blows his whistle]
44,16,8,Anchor,"Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says ""No,"" and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds."
45,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball! [the crowd waits a second, then applauds] Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide! [the crowd applauds and cheers] Go on, pat yourselves on the back! [and so the crowd members turn and pat each other on the back]"
46,16,8,Anchor,"Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington."
47,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[addressing Congress] Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! [Congress applauds. The President and his wife are present, and clap with Congress.]"
48,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,[removes his bra and throws it to the floor] This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
49,16,8,Clyde Donovan,I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
50,16,8,Stan Marsh,This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
51,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you know what? [removes his bra and throws it to the floor] Screw this!"
52,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing! [silence] We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!"
53,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,We don't even understand how this game is played.
54,16,8,Butters Stotch,"This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met! [walks up to Token] Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know. [walks up to Clyde] And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!"
55,16,8,Eric Cartman,That's true.
56,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us? [stands on a bench] Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!"
57,16,8,Clyde Donovan,Yeah.
58,16,8,Kenny McCormick,Yeah.
59,16,8,Butters Stotch,"And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!"
60,16,8,Boys,Yeah!
61,16,8,Butters Stotch,"And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!"
62,16,8,Boys,[jumping up and down] Yeah! Yeah!
63,16,8,Eric Cartman,"[puts his bra back on] Let's do this. [turns his back towards Stan] Stan, hook up my bra."
64,16,8,Roger Goodell,"As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh. [Randy gets applause from the audience as he rises. Goodell shakes Randy's hand] Congratulations, Marsh. Good job!"
65,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!"
66,16,8,Roger Goodell,Nice going!
67,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, no, you nice going! [they're still shaking hands]"
68,16,8,Photographer,"Hey guys, how about a nice fucking picture to welcome in the future of sports? [click]"
69,16,8,Announcer,Welcome to the inaugural game of the National Sarcastaball League! As we bring you today's matchup between the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders.
70,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! [crosses his arms]"
71,16,8,24,"Give them hell, coach! Lovin', not shovin'!"
72,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, good one! [the crowd begins to cheer the teams]"
73,16,8,Announcer,"And now, here are your Denver Whoop de fucking do girls!"
74,16,8,Cheerleaders,Woo! Woo!
75,16,8,Cheerleader 1,Go Broncos! Go!
76,16,8,Cheerleader 2,Whoop de fuckin' do!
77,16,8,Announcer,"And now, here to sing the sarcastaball anthem, recording artist, Cee-Lo!"
78,16,8,Cee Lo Green,"I love sarcastaball
It's so much better than football
I'm so glad they got rid of violence in sports
'Cause sarcastaball is so super fun to watch"
79,16,8,Fan 1,"Woo! Nice job, Cee-Lo! Good to see you on TV some more!"
80,16,8,Fan 2,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your hit songs!"
81,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?"
82,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us."
83,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
84,16,8,Stan Marsh,[stops and faces his friends] I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
85,16,8,Clyde Donovan,"Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. [looks down at the floor]"
86,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,We can't.
87,16,8,Clyde Donovan,"[somewhat cross] We don't have a coach, Kyle."
88,16,8,Eric Cartman,Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
89,16,8,Butters Stotch,Huh?
90,16,8,Craig Tucker,Hey yeah.
91,16,8,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Butters] The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory."
92,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas."
93,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you understand this game better than anybody."
94,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything."
95,16,8,Stan Marsh,Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
96,16,8,Butters Stotch,'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. [sticks out his tongue a bit]
97,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps in] We need you, Butters. You're the man! [Butters begins to feel the anticipation]"
98,16,8,The Team,Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters!
99,16,8,Butters' Fangirls (in a dream),"Butters, rah, Butters!"
100,16,8,A Fangirl,"I love you, Butters!"
101,16,8,Butters Stotch,"[stops his car and looks at the girls] I love you too, ladies. [blows them a kiss]"
102,16,8,Wendy Testaburger,"[to Butters' left] Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams."
103,16,8,Red,"[slides in to Butters' right] Leave him alone, Wendy! He's mine! [they each take a cheek and plant a big kiss on him.]"
104,16,8,Butters Stotch,Woohoohoohoohoo!
105,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Wuh wuuuhhh wuh! [sits up] Wha? Wha? Oh. [smiles, Then looks under the covers] Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again. [the door opens and Stephen steps in] More of my creamy goo came out. [Stephen sits on the bed]"
106,16,8,Stephen Stotch,"Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night."
107,16,8,Butters Stotch,"[excitedly] I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!"
108,16,8,Stephen Stotch,"All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it."
109,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Okay Dad! [Stephen gets up and walks out, and Butters opens up the top drawer of his night stand. He pulls out a small bottle, gets comfortable again, and collects up all the cream] Oh! Saaave that, for later. [puts a cap on the bottle]"
110,16,8,Announcer,The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos.
111,16,8,Cheerleader 1,"Go Broncos, Go."
112,16,8,Dan,"Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in. [the ref blows his whistle and raises his arms] Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!"
113,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[clapping slowly] Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!"
114,16,8,Dan,"They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge. [the judge looks at the replay monitor, then looks at the field]"
115,16,8,Side Judge,"Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!"
116,16,8,Randy Marsh,YEAH! [pumps his fist] YEAH! WOO!
117,16,8,Reporter 1,"Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner."
118,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. [covers his chest with his hands]"
119,16,8,Reporter 1,"Coach Belichick says, [reads from a small notepad] ""No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day."""
120,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!"
121,16,8,Reporter 2,Guess we'll find out on Sunday.
122,16,8,Randy Marsh,...Yeah... [the press leaves and Randy begins to think about next week]
123,16,8,Randy Marsh,"All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow."
124,16,8,Broncos (including Peyton Manning),D'awwwww!
125,16,8,Manning,Practice on Monday after a victory? Great!
126,16,8,Randy Marsh,"That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better."
127,16,8,Manning,Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!
128,16,8,Randy Marsh,That's IT! [claps approvingly]
129,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey Butters, you got a minute?"
130,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Wuh sure, Eric. [Cartman walks in and Butters closes the door]"
131,16,8,Eric Cartman,"I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor."
132,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player."
133,16,8,Eric Cartman,"No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters."
134,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?"
135,16,8,Eric Cartman,...I don't have a dad.
136,16,8,Butters Stotch,"...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out. [remembers looking at his groin and saying ""Oh jeez, there's a lot this time.""] But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings."
137,16,8,Eric Cartman,Youuu save it all?
138,16,8,Butters Stotch,"My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. [before them is a wall of semen samples that Butters has been collecting for over a year now. Another shot shows that he's going on two years' worth of semen, with shelves of it on the other two walls]"
139,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?"
140,16,8,Butters Stotch,"I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. [Cartman takes a bottle and chugs it down, then analyzes the flavor]"
141,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor."
142,16,8,Butters Stotch,Do you feel warm and compassionate?
143,16,8,Eric Cartman,[analyzes some more...] Holy shit I think I do.
144,16,8,Jim Rome,"Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling. [Randy Marsh appears on the monitor via satellite from his den] Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show."
145,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show."
146,16,8,Jim Rome,"Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go."
147,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this."
148,16,8,Jim Rome,Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times. [POV switch to Randy's den] Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times.
149,16,8,Randy Marsh,Thanks Jim. [closes the satellite link and switches to a window about sarcastaball strategies and starts working on them. Sharon walks in]
150,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?"
151,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?"
152,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?"
153,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!"
154,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain."
155,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!"
156,16,8,Sharon Marsh,Do you mean that?
157,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yes! I totally mean it! [breaks down and begins to tear up] Help me, Sharon. Help me."
158,16,8,Butters Stotch,"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. [Cartman approaches North Park's #7 and knocks him down. A referee sees this, blows his whistle and walks over to the two players]"
159,16,8,Spectators,Awwwwww!
160,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you idiot!"
161,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up! [the team huddles - er, cuddles up and Butters continues.] Now what is goin' on out there?"
162,16,8,Eric Cartman,That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
163,16,8,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters."
164,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. [Butters passes bottles of his semen around to the other boys, and they all drink the bottles down]"
165,16,8,Doctor,"Uh hum. Mmm. [turns towards Randy and Sharon] I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage."
166,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[dejected] Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better."
167,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"How do we fix this, doctor?"
168,16,8,Doctor,"You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain."
169,16,8,Randy Marsh,So that's it. [gets up and walks around] I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! [points to the doctor]
170,16,8,Doctor,"Ohh, rreally? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball? [gets into a thinking mode] Really? [rolls his eyes] That's fascinating. Please, go on."
171,16,8,Randy Marsh,"No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse."
172,16,8,Doctor,"You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains."
173,16,8,Randy Marsh,My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
174,16,8,Doctor,"Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say ""Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain."""
175,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! [turns left and leaves, and Sharon is thoroughly confused. She looks around]"
176,16,8,Jim Rome,"Jim Rome here. Hey, I love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's so thrilling I need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game. That's when I reach for a bottle of this. [holds up a small bottle, now in mass production] Butters' Creamy Goo. [the commercial follows]"
177,16,8,Voice Over,"[#18 runs with the balloon] You play hard. You need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost. [a split screen appears, with windows for football, basketball, women's soccer, and hockey] Sports these days are all about being nice, so take your game to the next level [#18 opens up a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo and drinks it]. With Butters' Creamy Goo. [a cyclist opens a bottle and drinks it. Some of it splatters on his face] You'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine. [a round window expands and Butters pops in through it]"
178,16,8,Butters Stotch,Like me!
179,16,8,Jim Rome,"Get with it, and get the Goo!"
180,16,8,Voice Over,Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size!
181,16,8,12,"When I get hot and tired, only one thing can boost my compassion. [drinks it down and keeps it there with some effort. A goo mustache stays on his upper lip] Now I'm back in the game! [Two players carry a bucket of goo and dump it on their coach.]"
182,16,8,Singer in Commercial,Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!
183,16,8,Voice Over,[an open bottle of it falls right side up to the grass and some goo spills out] Best served just above room temperature.
184,16,8,Butters Stotch,"42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT! [Cartman tosses the balloon back at him, and the players move forward. Butters backs up for a pass and throws the balloon up. The other team's player, #9, is ready] Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it! [#9 catches it and grins] Good job, kid! [an SUV rools onto the field, crushing #9 before it stops. The balloon bounces away unscathed. Randy is shown driving the SUV, with Sharon in tow]"
185,16,8,Randy Marsh,STAN?! Stan! [the players break their hugs and look at Randy]
186,16,8,Stan Marsh,Dad?
187,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[runs with Sharon towards him] Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!"
188,16,8,Stan Marsh,What?
189,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore."
190,16,8,Mr Mackey,"Hey, get off the field! M'kay?! [Randy walks to the sideline to address the crowd]"
191,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe. [a lot of fans have bought bottles of Butters' Creamy Goo] Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh! [gets a headache] Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again. [clears his throat again] Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would- [stomps his right foot in anger] God damn it!"
192,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!"
193,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!"
194,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!"
195,16,8,Sharon Marsh,Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
196,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!"
197,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"[stunned at the sarcasm coming from Stan] Ohohh Randy, it's happening! [cries and turns towards Randy for a hug, which he gives]"
198,16,8,Butters Stotch,"[walks up and stands next to Stan] Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along."
199,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!"
200,16,8,Stan Marsh,"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere?"
201,16,8,Randy Marsh,I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
202,16,8,Eric Cartman,That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
203,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah Dad. You need some of this. [walks forward and gives him a small bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo. Randy takes it and opens it, looking at the contents, then drinks it]"
204,16,8,Randy Marsh,...[deadpans] This is cum. [everyone's jaws drop]
205,16,8,Stephen Stotch,"And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done! [Butters is on his bed, looking chastened] Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to ""Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?""! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!"
206,16,8,Butters Stotch,What's sarcasm and what's cum?
207,16,8,Stephen Stotch,We'll talk about that when you're older!
208,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. [all the adults leave, with Stephen closing the door behind him. Butters sighs, then gets under his covers for the night. As he drifts off to sleep, we get this voice-over]"
209,16,8,Jim Rome,"Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but ""So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you."" Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days."
210,16,8,Butters Stotch,[wakes up and gasps] DAD! Hey Dad!
211,16,8,Stephen Stotch,[walks in] What?!
212,16,8,Butters Stotch,My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
213,16,8,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend."
214,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Thanks, Dad."
