36,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."""

42,16,6,Man 1,Hello.
43,16,6,Woman 2,Hi
44,16,6,Narrator,"The boys have just made a sobering discovery. [a shot of Stan's internal organs and spine] For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down. [this is shown] The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family. [Stan's brain and skull are shown] But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour."
45,16,6,Woman 2,"[quite pregnant] Hey, how are you?"
46,16,6,Stan Marsh,[mimicking] Good. How are you?
47,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. [the couple arrives]"
48,16,6,Clerk,"Alright, our last zipliners are here. [Kyle and Cartman are visibly angry]"
49,16,6,Man 2,"Sorry we made you wait, everybody. [A shot of Kyle's mouth interior is shown]"
50,16,6,Narrator,"Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, ""Dude, fuck you!"""
51,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,We don't mind.
52,16,6,Eric Cartman,"[being interviewed] Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. [the benches are rearranged so the zipliners can watch a TV screen above them]"
53,16,6,Clerk,Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
54,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"[who's just the clerk, naturally] Hey there Michael. [Everyone behind the boys laughs.]"
55,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. [return to the tour]"
56,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael."
57,16,6,Michael (Clerk),Thanks Michael. [turns off the TV] Anybody have any questions?
58,16,6,Eric Cartman,...No.
59,16,6,Man 2,I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? [the boys are stunned that this needs to be done]
60,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] ""Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"""
61,16,6,Michael (Clerk),Let's get out there and get zippin'! [everyone rises and heads out of the waiting room]
62,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ!
63,16,6,Eric Cartman,Finally!

66,16,6,Guide 1,"[a woman, waiting by a van that has been out earlier in the day] Everyone just step on in the shuttle. [opens the van's sliding door. The zipliners head for it]"
67,16,6,Stan Marsh,...Shuttle?
68,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?"
69,16,6,Michael (Clerk),It's about forty-five minutes.
70,16,6,Narrator,"It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear. [a look at Kyle's brain] His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word ""shuttle"" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons [this is shown] that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. [two images of overloaded shuttle buses appear, then footage of the Space Shuttle Challenger going up and exploding, and Kyle is scared]"
71,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, come on, we don't have a choice. [leads the others to the shuttle van.]"
72,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?"
73,16,6,Stan Marsh,Uh that's okay.
74,16,6,Man 3,"Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought- [Cartman begins to mutter angrily]"
75,16,6,Narrator,"[hour 2] It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle."
76,16,6,Michael (Clerk),We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!
77,16,6,Adults,Wooo!
78,16,6,Narrator,"But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing. [Cartman is drinking some Mountain Dew from a can. The camera looks around the van] Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen. [the camera goes down Eric's esophagus] Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months. [the camera comes back up the esophagus and out Cartman's mouth] And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back down Cartman's throat] The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas. [a quick journey through the intestines is shown] When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter. [the sphincter is shown] Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage. [this is shown, along with Kyle's reaction]"
79,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, did you fart?!"
80,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Mmmm, no?"
81,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright buys, we're here! [The van pulls up to the first entrace to Zipline Adventures. Both Stan and Kenny look sleepy]"
82,16,6,Stan Marsh,Thank God. [everyone is out of the van as Guide 1 goes up to the launch pad two stories up. The pad is attached to a pine tree]
83,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?"
84,16,6,Eric Cartman,The trees' biology?
85,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes."
86,16,6,Stan Marsh,I think we're good.
87,16,6,Man 2,[raises his left hand] I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.
88,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-"
89,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! [Cartman is hooked up]"
90,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work. [a shot of the tour group] Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out ""Shockabra!"", look up and give the camera a nice ""shockabra"" [two fists with thumbs and pinkies extended]. Alright, you ready?"
91,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. [Michael shortens the strap between Cartman and the zipline, and holds him up]"
92,16,6,Michael (Clerk),Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?
93,16,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
94,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright, let's hear you say ""Zipliiine!"""
95,16,6,Eric Cartman,Zipliiine. [Michael sends him on his way]
96,16,6,Michael (Clerk),[voice-over] Shockabra! [Cartman holds out his fists as indicated above and the camera takes his picture]
97,16,6,Guide 1,"Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!"
98,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Well? How was it, Cartman?"
99,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!"
100,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[as Kyle is prepped] Oh, really??"
101,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!"
102,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright Kyle, give me a ""Zipliiine!"""
103,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Zipline. [Michael sends him on his way]
104,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Shockabra! [does the fists. Kyle does the fists too and the camera takes his picture, but he's mad]"
105,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster."
106,16,6,Narrator,"After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens."
107,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! [the others cheer, but the boys are worried.]"
108,16,6,Eric Cartman,"[being interviewed] ""The next zipline? What are you talking about?"""
109,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?"
110,16,6,Michael (Clerk),This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.
111,16,6,Stan Marsh,[being interviewed] And it was like WHAM. [makes a fist with his right hand and punches his left handn with it.]
112,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,STOP!
113,16,6,Eric Cartman,NOOOO!
114,16,6,Guide,Everyone back in the shuttle!
115,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,NOOOO! [the adults and a fifth kid get back into the van]
116,16,6,Eric Cartman,NOOOO! [the adults and a fifth kid get back into the van]
117,16,6,Narrator,"The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. [the boys scream and some scens of the next ziplines flash by: Michael sends someone down the zipline, he plays guitar during a break ""led me through that""]"
118,16,6,Guide,Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?
119,16,6,Man 2,Yes.
120,16,6,Boys,"AAAA! [shots of Kyle, Kenny, and Stan]"
121,16,6,Adults,"""Ack"" went the little frog one day. ""Ack"" went the little green frog..."
122,16,6,Eric Cartman,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [opening shots return]
123,16,6,Michael (Clerk),Let 'er rip! [sends Man 2 on his way]
124,16,6,Man 4,Zipliiine!
125,16,6,Narrator,Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
126,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator."
127,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Wugh!
128,16,6,Narrator,Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.
129,16,6,Pete Nickals,"But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- [Woman 1 is shown going down, then man 1, then]"
130,16,6,Man 2,[with his wife] Could you get another picture of us? [hands Kyle the camera]
131,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [a shot of the whole group is shown]
132,16,6,Narrator,The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
133,16,6,Eric Cartman,[on his way down a zipline.] I'm so fucking bored! [Hour 3 arrives. Michael sends the next zipliner on down. The others cheer her on]
134,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright, you going next, Ricky? [hooks Ricky up and sends him down]"
135,16,6,The Boys,[on the ground] Help! Somebody! Help us! [the adults on the launch pad cheer the next zipliner down]
136,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
137,16,6,Stan Marsh,There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
138,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,[grabs Stan's arms] Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! [another zipliner goes down]
139,16,6,Zipliner,Zipline!
140,16,6,Adults,Woohoo!
141,16,6,Eric Cartman,"We should have never listened to you, Kyle."
142,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Me?!
143,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"""
144,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!"
145,16,6,Eric Cartman,I brought it up because you already brought it up!
146,16,6,Stan Marsh,[being interviewed] That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
147,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,You fat piece of shit!
148,16,6,Eric Cartman,Fuck you Kyle!
149,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!"
150,16,6,Eric Cartman,Yes!
151,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes!
152,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?"
153,16,6,Narrator,"But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea. [the camera goes down Cartman's throat.] Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea. [the camera goes back up his throat and out his mouth] But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back in] His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste. [a quick trip through Cartman's intestines, as before] The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear. [this is shown, and the smell wafts up into Kyle's nose] Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb."
154,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
155,16,6,Eric Cartman,Nnnn-mo...
156,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible."
157,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch."
158,16,6,Guide,"[standing in a covered lunch area] Come in by the waterfall, gang! [it's a small waterfall]"
159,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?"
160,16,6,Man 2,Skip a free lunch? Not me! [runs to the lunch area. The other zipliners follow]
161,16,6,Guide,Wo wants sandwiches? [pulls out sealed sandwiches from a portable ice box] We got ...turkey. [Man 2 takes that one] Ham. [another zipliner takes that one] Turkey ham. [another zipliner takes that one...]
162,16,6,Pete Nickals,"[in the background] Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. [in the foreground the boys are sitting on their own log with the word HELP on the ground before them made with twigs and branches]"
163,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! [keeps sipping the Double Dew]"
164,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!"
165,16,6,Eric Cartman,"This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew. [at the bottom of the can is a blurb saying ""DEW THE MATH!""] Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast."
166,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
167,16,6,Eric Cartman,"If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!"
168,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[runs up to the tour guides] Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick."
169,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?"
170,16,6,Stan Marsh,...Yyyeah.
171,16,6,Guide,"That's not herpes, it's a cold sore."
172,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Right, sorry."
173,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go."
174,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down."
175,16,6,Some adults,Zipline! Wooo!
176,16,6,Guide,What about the stables?
177,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back."
178,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true."
179,16,6,Rancher,"Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?"
180,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Yea, please!"
181,16,6,Rancher,Well I think we can set ya up.
182,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, thank God!"
183,16,6,Stan Marsh,You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
184,16,6,Rancher,"Step right out here, we'll get you going. [leads the boys out to a horseback riding tour] Got four more for you, Duncan. [All the riders wave and say hello, and a few take pictures]"
185,16,6,Eric Cartman,NOOO! [opening shots return]
186,16,6,Narrator,Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
187,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"AAAAH! [the boys are now shown on horseback in this order: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny]"
188,16,6,Eric Cartman,[still aching] Eeeeugh.
189,16,6,Narrator,Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. [the camera tries some dramatic moves]
190,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Can we please go faster?!
191,16,6,Kenny McCormick,(I can't take it!)
192,16,6,Duncan,We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.
193,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAAAAAAH!
194,16,6,Eric Cartman,Uh oh. [lets out a wet fart]
195,16,6,Rider 1,"[to Kyle] So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning."
196,16,6,Narrator,"An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining"""

200,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Just go. Go without me.
201,16,6,Stan Marsh,"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!"
202,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't take it anymore. [his voice gets weaker] Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan."
203,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought ""I can find us a way out!"" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it."
204,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[returns from his search quite excited] You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!"
205,16,6,Eric Cartman,A marina?
206,16,6,Stan Marsh,"We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!"
207,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,What's the point?
208,16,6,Stan Marsh,Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! [an announcer says the following lines]

210,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
211,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!"

216,16,6,Narrator,"For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat"" [more shots of the boys on the Puffin]"

218,16,6,Kenny McCormick,Beavers! [a beaver is swimming in the water]
219,16,6,Narrator,"After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining."

221,16,6,Eric Cartman,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
222,16,6,Narrator,"If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die. [Stan looks ready to sleep. Cartman takes a swig of Mountain Dew]"
223,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Here! [takes Cartman's bottle] Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
224,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it."
225,16,6,Eric Cartman,I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
226,16,6,Kenny McCormick,"Hey. [tugs on Cartman, who turns to look at him] Fuck you, Cartman."

229,16,6,Narrator,Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
230,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!"
231,16,6,Eric Cartman,"No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!"
232,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!"
233,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said ""Stop it!"""
234,16,6,Stan Marsh,[rises and walks a bit] Stop it! It was me! My idea.
235,16,6,Eric Cartman,You?!
236,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out the brochure for Backcountry Adventures, then looks at it for a few seconds] I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. [Kyle and Cartman look at each other]"
237,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!"
238,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[turns to face them] If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. [the camera pans down and sure enough, the offer is on the brochure cover: Sign up 3 friends and get an iPod NANO!!!]"
239,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!

241,16,6,Eric Cartman,[points at Stan] You... You killed Kenny! [Stan begins to weep]
242,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! [a shot of Kenny, then a shot of the three surviving boys crying. Kyle cries on Cartman's shoulder and Cartman comforts him]"
243,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one."
244,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed, crying] The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back. [wipes away the flowing tears] I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere."
245,16,6,Narrator,"But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. [the boys look around, startled]"
246,16,6,Eric Cartman,[being interviewed] It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.

251,16,6,Eric Cartman,[being interviewed] We were saved. It was over.
252,16,6,Narrator,"After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter. [shown, the images are back to the cartoon form] In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven. [a jet plane made of poo] From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express. [The ziplining Shockabra pictures are shown] Four friends, turn apart by tragedy [Kenny's image vanishes, leaving the forest background in place], would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents. [Mr. Hankey delivers them personally. The parents are distraught] And the boys received treatment for their herpes. [two paramedics treat Stan and Cartman as Mr. Hankey looks on from above. Stan and Cartman focus on Mr. Hankey.]"
253,16,6,Eric Cartman,"[being interviewed] No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore."
254,16,6,Narrator,"[shots of the scenes being described are shown] Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining. [a lecture tour. Stan is shown on stage with a ""No on Ziplining"" logo] His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman, [shown as a mountaineer] he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math."
255,16,6,Eric Cartman,"[being interviewed] It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. [takes a long sip]"
