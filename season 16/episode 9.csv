0,16,9,Stan Marsh,"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?"
1,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[looks over his left shoulder] Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? [looks at the gloves again]"
2,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat."
3,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns left to address Kyle] I'm not fat, Kyle."
4,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Right, you're not fat."
5,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like [that] bitch! [they see a scooter rolls past them with an obese man on it]"
6,16,9,Stan Marsh,Whoa duude!
7,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? [another obese man rolls up behind them]"
8,16,9,Obese Man,"Excuse me. [They just look up at him] Excuse me! [they part the aisle for him - Stan, Cartman and Kenny take the side with the gloves on it, Kyle takes the other side,]"
9,16,9,Eric Cartman,See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
10,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why do they even allow those things in stored?
11,16,9,Stan Marsh,"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. [Indeed, a small fleet of them are available for rent, at $19.99 each. They're labeled as electric wheelchairs. Obese people are in line as one after another of them rents a Rascal. The boys turn a corner to have a look at the Rascals as they're being rented]"
12,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,You've gotta be kidding me!
13,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[eyes some Oreos and goes for them] Oh my God you guys, look at this! [grabs a box and reads it] Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling. [closes his eyes and looks up joyfully] Holy hell yes!"
14,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all?? [an obese man and an obese woman squeeze past each other in an aisle on their scooters.] That's YOU one day, fatass![Stan and Kenny leave] Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! [turns and follows Stan and Kenny away. Cartman is left alone with the Oreos and his thoughts]"
15,16,9,Obese Lady and Two Obese Men,[rolls up in her Rascal] Are those Candy Corn Oreos?
16,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah... Yeah, here you go. [walks over, tosses them into her basket, and walks away with his head down]"
17,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?"
18,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why? [his eyebrows move to odd positions every so often]
19,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[walks in] I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart. [stops] You're right Kyle. I'm fat. [sighs] All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck."
20,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-"
21,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it. [walks out of the house. Kyle is puzzled. Moments later, Cartman returns on a Rascal and rolls on into Kyle's living room] Sweeeeeeeeeet!"
22,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,[angrily]Oh no!
23,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. [begins to ride in a circle around Kyle]"
24,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,You don't need that! Get off of it.
25,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[stops] Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. [rides away]"
26,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!"
27,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[reaches the restroom and tries to get it, but the base is too wide] Hmm. [tries again. Kyle catches up] I can't. [tries again] I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. [tries again]"
28,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,What??
29,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle. [tries again] You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. [tries again]"
30,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,So take a shit somewhere else!
31,16,9,Eric Cartman,"That's not the way this country works, Kyle. [tries again] Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter. [tries again] It's the law."
32,16,9,Gerald Broflovski,[arrives] What's going on down here?
33,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[tries again] Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible. [tries again] I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit. [backs out and prepares to leave] Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. [rolls away. Kyle looks on angrily]"
34,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[""Nobody understands how embarrassing it is to live with obesity."" He rides past a couple] Out of the way. Out of the way please. [""Wherever you go, you're treated differently"" He arrives at a Denny's]"
35,16,9,Denny's Greeter,Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window. [Cartman goes towards the booth and grins]
36,16,9,Ticket Teller,"Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh..."
37,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Coming through. Oh how humiliating. [now at the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland: ""But even at Disneyland I get reminded of my weight."" He rolls into the short line] Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel. [reaches the front of the line] Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have- [finds a line of other scooter riders in front of him] Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!"
38,16,9,Legless Boy,I don't have legs.
39,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well you got skinny arms! [Later on, Cartman rolls through Cnderella's Castle. ""And then even Disneyland can't take away the shame, as all the people suffering from obesity are ignored. Like, we're invisible."" A woman's baby carriage gets in the way and she quickly pulls it back as Cartman rolls towards the exits] 'Scuse me. Move it."
40,16,9,Eric Cartman,"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy? [chokes up and begins to sob] At Besty Buy I'm sorry. [At the defense table sits a Best Buy employee, looking around] To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom? [reaches for a long-handled grip with his left hand, then uses it to take a tissue from the judge's bench. He grabs the tissue with his right hand and lowers the grip, then blows his nose] Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?"
41,16,9,Anchor,"More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping."
42,16,9,Obese Man 2,"[being jostled in his Rascal by a group of boys] Stop it you kids! sto- Oop- Owww.[the boys succeed in tipping him over and the man is on his side unable to get up. The kids laugh and scatter, and the man begins to sound like a pig] Weak! Weak!"
43,16,9,Anchor,"The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. [The device is shown, and it resembles a telescoping cane]"
44,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. [facing him is the rest of the fourth grade class]"
45,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,You have got to be kidding me!
46,16,9,Eric Cartman,"What, Kyle?! [the device then collapses and puts itself away]"
47,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
48,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[rolls up to him] You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!"
49,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
50,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh! Oh, did you hear him?! [rolls back to the workers] This is exactly what Adele is talking about! [begins to pace back and forth] Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle! [rolls up to Kyle] Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day [rolls away] to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers! [rolls back up to Kyle] You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look! [rolls to the far end of the gum] I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!"
51,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Who's Honey Boo Boo?
52,16,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?"
53,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches. [at a pageant, onstage, dressed to win] I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!"
54,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew."
55,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"[back in her trophy room] I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!"
56,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"[at a pageant, performs some chest compressions on Honey] Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo! [Honey Boo Boo comes to] Now get up and wave to them judges! [later on, to the camera] We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy. [Stan and Kyle are watching the show in Stan's living room. Kyle gets up and walks off]"
57,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore."
58,16,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing."
59,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,This is it! Throttle down!
60,16,9,A crewman,"[voice only] Throttle down! [Cameron leaves the bridge and goes on deck, putting on a diving suit]"
61,16,9,Crewman 1,"Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?"
62,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
63,16,9,Crewman 1,"The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron."
64,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters? [points at him] How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME. [puts on some gloves and gets into a bathysphere. He closes the hatch and locks himself in] Let her go! [two workers pull down the release switches in unison. The crane releases the bathysphere and... it hits the deck below. It rolls to one side towards the edge and then drops off. Under the water, as it sinks, Cameron gets to work] UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on."
65,16,9,"News Anchor, Announcer, Singers","His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron."
66,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
67,16,9,"News Anchor, Announcer, Singers","James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea"
68,16,9,Crewman 1,"Yes, James, we hear the song."
69,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.
70,16,9,"News Anchor, Announcer, Singers",With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.
71,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, hurry it up in there! [inside, a toilet and the two urinals have been removed to make room for the wheelchair-accessible toilet. Cartman rolls up the ramp to get to the toilet]"
72,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. [gets off the Rascal]"
73,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[starting to fume, steps away from the crowd] This has gone far enough! [the other boys turn to look at him] How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!"
74,16,9,Token Black,"Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness."
75,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
76,16,9,Token Black,"Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television."
77,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?"
78,16,9,Token Black,"[walks up to Kyle] At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything."
79,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right."
80,16,9,Token Black,"Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air."
81,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! [walks away smiling. Token watches him leave, then walks off in the opposite direction. The rest of the boys go back to waiting at the restroom door. Craig watches Kyle leave, then notices Token and follows him]"
82,16,9,Craig Tucker,"Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth."
83,16,9,Token Black,"He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. [hurries away]"
84,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. [clicks on a remote to turn down the lights]"
85,16,9,Token Black,"[voice over. Cartman is shown rolling down the street] He's chubby, [Cartman is shown at a table with lots of courses for him to go through] he's filthy [Cartman belches], and he's just a little bit nuts. [sideswipes a letter carrier and then gives him the finger] Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! [""Here Comes Fatty Doo Doo"" appears onscreen with a picture of Cartman on his Rascal, with his back to the camera]"
86,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Fatty Doo Doo?
87,16,9,Randy Newman,"Who's that scootin' on a scooter? Fatty Doo Doo
Who's got doodoo like a fatty scoop de do?"
88,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
89,16,9,Randy Newman,"Nobody scoots a fatty doo like you do.
Scatty foo foo
Patty poo poo
White president, black president, I don't care.
Just scoop me up some doodoo and I'll be right there.
I. Only. Know. Five. Chords. Six-"
90,16,9,Token Black,Come in.
91,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,[enters and approaches the desk] What have you done?
92,16,9,Token Black,"I helped you make a documentary, Kyle."
93,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!"
94,16,9,Token Black,"Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television."
95,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??"
96,16,9,Token Black,"[hops off his chair and walks to a window] I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel. [turns around and faces Kyle] If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?"
97,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?"
98,16,9,Token Black,"But she's not black, Kyle. She's white. [a few seconds of silence] The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up. [faces the window again] Not by us, or anyone else."
99,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,You guys seeing this?!
100,16,9,Crewman 1,"Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron."
101,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five."
102,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?"
103,16,9,Stan Marsh,"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?"
104,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo."
105,16,9,Stan Marsh,"[alarmed, gets up and walks up to Kyle] Dude! Dude, not cool!"
106,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
107,16,9,Stan Marsh,Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
108,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,[a bit shocked] What? Oh my God.
109,16,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah dude. It's really serious.
110,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog."
111,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,[clapping] I'mm gettin' a piiig heaaart.
112,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!"
113,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,I waunt that one!
114,16,9,Farmer,This one here? [picks up a sow near them and shows off the sow's belly] You want this one??
115,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,Yeah! No wait! That pig over there gave me the evil eye! I wuant that one! I waunt [squeezes her eyes closed for a second] that one!
116,16,9,Farmer,This one? [picks up a sow near them and shows off the sow's belly] this one right here?? Ya waunt this one??
117,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,I want that one's heart! It looked at me funny!
118,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart. [looks over her shoulder] Honey Boo Boo! [no response] Honey BOO BOO!
119,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,What?!
120,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?
121,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"I'm gonna tell them ""my heart is sweeter than bacon, child!"" [Mama turns back to the camera and grins]"
122,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,Who waunts sketti and butter? [pig noises are heard and the camera pans down to show Honey Boo Boo crawling all over the floor] She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!
123,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"This is myyy scaaar 'cause I got a pig heart. My scar makes me sassy, child! [blows a kiss to the camera]"
124,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"S. S. Cameron? This is James Cameron. I am now at... 16,000 feet. You should see the cold darkness of it all. The isolation and yet awwwe of the sea's magnitude. I have now sunk deeper than any human has ever been before! [he soon encounters another man in a diving suit]"
125,16,9,Randy Newman,We are here in the ocean depths goin' deep deep deep- [turns around and sees the bathysphere... and its pilot] Oh hey James Cameron.
126,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,What the fuck?!
127,16,9,Randy Newman,I've been divin' in the deep and I'm feelin' so cheap.
128,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!
129,16,9,Randy Newman,"I don't want anyone raisin' the bar, 'cause nobody'll hire me! Deep deep deep in the ocean. Ohhh, come on. Fight me, Cameron."
130,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell! [maneuvers the bathysphere's arms and lands a right punch on Newman, who falls away in slow motion]"
131,16,9,Eric Cartman,"It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!"
132,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger."
133,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer! [the lawyer appears outside the office and tries to enter, but can't. The lawyer is on his own Rascal] As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!"
134,16,9,Token Black,[waits a second] It actually aired last night.
135,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,You found a network to buy it?
136,16,9,Token Black,"Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo."
137,16,9,Eric Cartman,What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
138,16,9,Token Black,"Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-"
139,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[begins riding around] I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! [turns around and rides out of the office]"
140,16,9,Announcer,"We welcome you to the First Lady's Symposium on Obesity, with your keynote speaker, Michelle Obama. [the audience applauds]"
141,16,9,Michelle Obama and her aide,"Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention. [Kyle is present, which means Cartman didn't fly alone] A conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. What will we do as a country? I cannot give you any easy answers. But what I can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! Honey Boo Boo versus Fatty Poo Poo! [the audience cheers loudly as the bell rings and two men pour sketti and butter onto the grass with five-gallon pots. Token is at Cartman's corner and Mama is at Honey's corner]"
142,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[making 8's with his Rascal and itching for a fight] You're goin' down, bitch! [also in attendance are Butters, Stan, Kevin, and Craig] Nobody takes my ratings!"
143,16,9,Token Black,"That's good, Fatty, get pissed!"
144,16,9,Eric Cartman,I'm pissed!
145,16,9,Token Black,"Yeah, Fatty!"
146,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!"
147,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"[clapping] Ain't nobody can beat my Boo Boo at sketti wrestlin'! [meanwhile, Honey Boo Boo is striking poses and blowing kisses non-stop]"
148,16,9,Michelle Obama and her aide,Let's do this! [the contestants approach each other in the center of the sketti ring as the audience cheers and applauds wildly. Cartman suddenly rushes at her and sideswipes her]
149,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,[falling to the ground] Ow!
150,16,9,Eric Cartman,"I ain't done with you, bitch!"
151,16,9,Man,Yeah! Tip assist!
152,16,9,Crewman 2,You think he's dead? [the first crewman wakes up]
153,16,9,Crewman 3,I hope so.
154,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar! [the crewmen begin to stir. Soon they're all gathered at the computer monitor] Divert all power to sub systems! Two percent oxygen left! [the bethysphere rises quickly, followed by a long cable] The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch!"
155,16,9,Crewman 4,Well I'll be damned.
156,16,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you okay? [Honey Boo Boo gets up, and Cartman turns back to strike her down again]"
157,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again and looks at Cartman, and he strikes her down once again] Did it start with fat people on scooters?[Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] Or did the bar get lowered way before that? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.
