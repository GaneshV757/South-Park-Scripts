0,16,3,Mitt Romney,"I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way."
1,16,3,Rick Santorum,I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
2,16,3,Newt Gingrich,"What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama."
3,16,3,Ron Paul,"We faced something much much greater after World War II. [the camera pans to Stan, who is in the audience] We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs-"
4,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Tango, Tango, I'm in position."
5,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[offscreen] Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?"
6,16,3,Stan Marsh,It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
7,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Butters. Bring it in."
8,16,3,Butters Stotch,"[going through a hallway with a trolley] Equipment is flying in, ten seconds."
9,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman."
10,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[in a wooden dark place with two wires on the ground] I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go."
11,16,3,Agent 1,We might have a problem.
12,16,3,Agent 2,What's that?
13,16,3,Agent 1,We just got word somebody might try to Faith Hill this event.
14,16,3,Agent 2,"Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch! [raises his fists and walks away. The stage is shown through Stan's angle. Three other agents step on the stage.]"
15,16,3,Stan Marsh,"I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this. [Butters takes a plate from the trolley, which has an iPhone on it, and walks to the left. Meanwhile Kenny comes from the opposite direction, taking the iPhone and passing it to Stan.] I got it."
16,16,3,Agent 3,"Hey, somebody is under the stage."
17,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,Go Cartman! [Cartman runs up and comes on the stage. He cheerfully pulls his shirt out near the nipple area. Stan takes a picture. Four agents come up to chase Cartman.]
18,16,3,Butters Stotch,We got it. We got it!
19,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Go, go, go."
20,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. [The agents run after them.]"
21,16,3,Reporter,"First, there was planking. [various images of people planking come up] People taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the Internet. Planking was soon replaced by owling. [a picture of a boy with his knees drawn to his chest] And after the Super Bowl by Bradying. [New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as well as an overweight man, both sitting on the ground with their legs straight out, hands clasped and looking down] But the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs. [Cartman pulling out his shirt at the debate is shown, this time fullscreen] It's called Faith Hilling. And all around the world people are doing it. [A black boy pulling his red shirt, then a ginger boy with a cap doing the exact same thing with his grey-and-white sweatshirt] Kids, adults, and even notable celebrities are getting into the act. [L.A. Lakers player Kobe Bryant is shown pulling on his jersey. The news studio comes to view again.] But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it?"
22,16,3,Professor Lamont,"I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire! [the children are listening to him, Cartman has a bored look] Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of Bradying. From football quarterback to football singer."
23,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late."
24,16,3,Professor Lamont,"[lowers the screen] I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across. [projects the film]"
25,16,3,Speaker,For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called Tebowing [The caption TEBOWING appears in the middle of the screen].
26,16,3,Speaker,[offscreen] This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous Tebowing can be.
27,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.
28,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,"I don't know, Ryan. You sure this is a good idea? [Ryan walks onto a railway]"
29,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,"Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second. How could I get hurt? [kneels down and puts his right elbow on his right knee, closing his eyes as well as pinching his nose bridge]"
30,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,"Okay, hold still. [puts up his iPhone. A train horn is heard.] What's that?"
31,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,A traaain! AAAAAA! [Barkley and Ryan continue to scream and look around while staying in the same position. The train is still off in the distance.]
32,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,RYAN!
33,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,"No, no! Nooo! No, no, no, no, noooo! [The train finally comes at full force and hits Ryan, severing him in half and covering Barkley in blood. In the classroom, Butters screams after what he has seen.]"
34,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,RYAN!
35,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,Learn from me. [dies]
36,16,3,Woman 1,"This sure is a nice car, Tommy. [raises her iPhone] Would you like to get a picture of me Tebowing in it?"
37,16,3,Tommy and his wife,"Sure. [gets the iPhone to take her picture. As the woman poses, the train's headlight appears in the distance and its horn is heard.] What is that?"
38,16,3,Woman 1,"Oh my God, it's coming!"
39,16,3,Tommy and his wife,"God no! [he exits the car while she continues Tebowing inside, revealing that they parked on the railroad track] No, no!"
40,16,3,Woman 1,"[scared] Tommy, d-did you get the picture?"
41,16,3,Tommy and his wife,"Hold on, wait, hold on! [hurriedly presses on the iPhone, then gets ready to take the picture]"
42,16,3,Woman 1,"Hurry, hurry! AAAAA! [The train finally comes at full force and crushes the car as Tommy runs off. Her bloody, severed head then lands onto a dirt field next to the track and her mouth opens] Aaah! [The classroom. Butters screams again in horror.]"
43,16,3,Man 1,"Be careful up there, Pete."
44,16,3,Pete,"[Tebowing on top of a wall with graffiti in a residential area] Just go on and take the picture. [the wall is suddenly destroyed by a train, killing Pete and knocking his friend down, before he quickly gets up and looks on in horror. Butters in the classroom screams.]"
45,16,3,Speaker,"These youths paid with their lives for Tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs [puts his index and middle fingers up], bunny ears [raises his arm while keeping the previous gesture] and fake wiener [turns his body sideways, bends his left arm and leg] Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you. Maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and Tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future, [a blue screen comes to view while the following words of the speaker gets typed] get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember.  [a photo of three teenagers from the 1980s. The following lines are sung] Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. Peace signs! Bunny ears! Fake wiener! [the three memes are demonstrated by the photos of the teenagers performing them.]"
46,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[yawns] Oh, God. That was boring."
47,16,3,Kenny McCormick,(Totally!)
48,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"So, what do you want to do now?"
49,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there."
50,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, that's a good idea."
51,16,3,Butters Stotch,What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
52,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation."
53,16,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, count me out."
54,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?"
55,16,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, I'm scared. [Craig shows up]"
56,16,3,Craig Tucker,"Hey, did you see today's newspaper?"
57,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?"
58,16,3,Craig Tucker,You guys made the front page.
59,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Really? [the boys excitedly run, except for Butters]"
60,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we are on the front page!"
61,16,3,Eric Cartman,Yes!
62,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, dude!)"
63,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Can we get a different pose, please? [hands the clerk two dollars and gets the paper]"
64,16,3,Eric Cartman,"What's it say, what's it say?"
65,16,3,Stan Marsh,"It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late."
66,16,3,Eric Cartman,"What? Let me see that. [the newspaper has Cartman's pictured and a headline 'Faith Hilling so 2,000 late']"
67,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,How can that be? Already?
68,16,3,Stan Marsh,[reads the newspaper] Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
69,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
70,16,3,Stan Marsh,"[continues reading] ""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."""
71,16,3,Eric Cartman,Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
72,16,3,Stan Marsh,That's all it is? [Kenny moves to the left-hand side]
73,16,3,Eric Cartman,You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. [shows three other guys' pictures]
74,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,But that's stupid. [Kenny moves to the right-hand side] How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
75,16,3,Eric Cartman,"I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage. [shows a couple of more pictures] This has to be stopped, you guys."
76,16,3,Boy 1,"[giggles] Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. [the iPhone screen is shown as Cartman photobombs while Faith Hilling.]"
77,16,3,Eric Cartman,"How is this Kyle? This good? [the boy moves away a bit. The other kids are stunned. The boys stand next to them, Kyle having an iPhone in his hands]"
78,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yep, that's great. [glances at the other kids]"
79,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[continues moving as the other boy tries to get past him] Cool, these will be good uploads."
80,16,3,Boy 2,"Hey, what are you doing?"
81,16,3,Eric Cartman,Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
82,16,3,Boy 1,Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
83,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe."
84,16,3,Boy 2,[starts to crawl away] Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else. [Cartman continues to cover his view] [to Cartman] Knock it off!
85,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Why don't you make me? [the boy punches him, Cartman responds by hitting him on the ground. Stan and Kyle begin to punch Boy 1 while Kenny attacks the girls.]"
86,16,3,Professor Lamont,"Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe. [the boys glance at each other] Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed! [puts the gun on Butters' desk] That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up."
87,16,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh, that's okay. I think..."
88,16,3,Professor Lamont,Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and Hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
89,16,3,Kids,"Yes, sir."
90,16,3,Professor Lamont,Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
91,16,3,Butters Stotch,HA?!
92,16,3,Professor Lamont,"Hey! You're following plankers and Tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT! [Butters hesitantly puts the gun in his mouth] Everybody take a good look. [points to Butters] This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. You're playing roulette with your lives! [A hawk is heard offscreen. Two men enter the classroom.]"
93,16,3,Man 2,"Professor Lamont, we need to talk."
94,16,3,Professor Lamont,I will be right back. [leaves the classroom]
95,16,3,Man 2,"You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont."
96,16,3,Professor Lamont,"Yes, what is this about? [puts his bag on the table]"
97,16,3,Man 3,"We need your expertise, sir."
98,16,3,Man 2,"Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?"
99,16,3,Professor Lamont,Another species? What are you talking about?
100,16,3,Man 3,"We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand... [types on his laptop] this. [turns around the laptop. Professor Lamont puts on his reading glasses to look at the screen, which shows various cats with breads around their heads.] Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us."
101,16,3,Professor Lamont,They're evolving. Cats are evolving. [moves the cursor down to see more pictures]
102,16,3,Man 3,Sorry?
103,16,3,Professor Lamont,"There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt."
104,16,3,Man 2,We're having a hard time following you here.
105,16,3,Professor Lamont,[opens a book] Look. In the 70s there was fonzing. [the book page has two people's pictures with their thumbs up] Which replaced the outdated mustaching. [a guy with his index finger above his lips] In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting. [people raising their fists up to the sky] But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s. [the Nazis doing their trademark salute] Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking. [an Ancient Egypt painting]
106,16,3,Man 2,You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
107,16,3,Professor Lamont,"[walks to the front] If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures, [takes his glasses off] they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. [dramatic music plays]"
108,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this? [Mr. Kitty looks at him] You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty. [closes his laptop and approaches Mr. Kitty] Bad Mr. Kitty. [Cartman hits Mr. Kitty with a stick. Mr. Kitty hisses, then paws at him.] Bad kitty! No more memeing! [walks away] Come on, guys. [the boys walk out of the room. Cartman turns his back to scold his cat again] Bad Mr. Kitty!"
109,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Well, I'm glad we took care of that."
110,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?"
111,16,3,Eric Cartman,I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
112,16,3,Stan Marsh,That's a cool idea
113,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"[sighs] (Oh, fuck it, dude.) [walks away]"
114,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"W-what's the matter, Kenny?"
115,16,3,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
116,16,3,Stan Marsh,What seems pointless?
117,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)"
118,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! [the boys approach Kenny] Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?"
119,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)"
120,16,3,Stan Marsh,"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap."
121,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her."
122,16,3,Reporter,"Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say ""Oh Long Johnson"" on video before getting out of the way."
123,16,3,Boy 3,"You ready, you ready?"
124,16,3,Boy 4,"[offscreen] I'm recording, go."
125,16,3,Boy 3,[the machine throws balls. The boy stands in front of them] Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. O-Oh Long- [gets hit by a ball]
126,16,3,Boy 4,Larry!
127,16,3,Reporter,"This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety."
128,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
129,16,3,Reporter,The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death.
130,16,3,Stan Marsh,Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
131,16,3,Boy 1,"[his fellows are standing besides him. He has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way."
132,16,3,Stan Marsh,"[continues to crawl around] Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- [he is confronted by Stan, Kyle and Kenny]"
133,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what's going on?"
134,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? [hurriedly puts his pants on]"
135,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?"
136,16,3,Boy 1,"He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff."
137,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out."
138,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?"
139,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,Benedict Arnold. [the three boys walk away]
140,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay? [the boys stop] You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. [Kenny looks down]"
141,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny?
142,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"[approaches Stan and the other boys] (I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)"
143,16,3,Boy 1,"If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. [he and his friends walk away]"
144,16,3,Stan Marsh,"You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. [Kenny pulls down his pants and starts crawling on his butt.]"
145,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,You guys are sellouts.
146,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[holds him] Come on, Kyle."
147,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,You're freaking sellouts!
148,16,3,Eric Cartman,"It's okay, man, come on."
149,16,3,Professor Lamont,What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire? [the black cat is kept in a cage]
150,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
151,16,3,Professor Lamont,"Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?"
152,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Jeeea-
153,16,3,Professor Lamont,You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
154,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh oh oh.
155,16,3,Reporter 2,"Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival. [walks to a railway] A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it ""reporting"". And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal. [train horn] Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. [gets hit by the train]"
156,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more. [Cartman raises his left hand a bit] Yeah, yeah freeze there. [a man comes into view with his little son]"
157,16,3,Little Boy,"What are those boys doing, daddy?"
158,16,3,Dad,"Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time."
159,16,3,Little Boy,How droll. [The man and boy leave the scene. Cartman and Kyle look down for a moment]
160,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Get a couple facing the other way, brah. [turns the other way]"
161,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, good idea. [a doctor comes out of the clinic]"
162,16,3,Doctor,"Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine. [giggles] Get it? [goes back to his clinic. A man with a car sounds his horn]"
163,16,3,Man 4,Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!
164,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Cartman] We have to face it, Cartman."
165,16,3,Eric Cartman,"I know. I know Kyle. [stops lifting his ""nipples"" up]"
166,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,I really thought it was gonna last.
167,16,3,Eric Cartman,I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change. [starts crying] The sun hurts my eyes. [wipes away his tears]
168,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
169,16,3,Eric Cartman,"No, no. It was kind of stupid, really."
170,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,I-It's good that it became something else.
171,16,3,Eric Cartman,And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. [both of them sigh]
172,16,3,Reporter,"Household cats have evolved into a species as intelligent as humans. Will this mean war between our two life forms? In an attempt to try and communicate with the leader of cats, experts have sent in the ambassador of people."
173,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Hello.
174,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
175,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,"Meow, meow."
176,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
177,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Long Johnson.
178,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
179,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Oh Long Johnson.
180,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh- Oh Don Piano.
181,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Oh Don Piano.
182,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
183,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Oh Don Piaaano.
184,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Jon-Jon-Johnson.
185,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Oh Lala Lionde. Oh Long John- Don Piano. Don Piaaaano.
186,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson. [the ambassador closes the door]
187,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,"I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children."
188,16,3,Stan Marsh,"[has the iPhone in his hands, while Kyle and Kenny stand next to him] Okay, that's good, a little higher."
189,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[he is doing a combination of Taylor Swifting and Cat Breading] Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?"
190,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that's awesome."
191,16,3,Stan Marsh,"OK, whenever you're ready."
192,16,3,Mr Kitty,Meow.
193,16,3,Eric Cartman,"No, kitty, you have to be quiet."
194,16,3,Mr Kitty,Meow.
195,16,3,Eric Cartman,No kitty! That's a bad kitty! [Boy 1 and his friends come over]
196,16,3,Boy 1,"Wow, what's this?"
197,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting."
198,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Alright, go Cartman."
199,16,3,Eric Cartman,[begins to crawl while holding Mr. Kitty] Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
200,16,3,Girl 1,That's pretty cool.
201,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome."
202,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,It's super awesome.
203,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time."
204,16,3,Mr Kitty,"Meow, meow."
205,16,3,Eric Cartman,"SHUT UP, KITTY!"
206,16,3,Reporter 3,"With the inevitable species war looming, our country's brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats. It's called putty-whistling. And the question on everyone's mind... Who will be the first person to die from it? [Rick, Mitt, Newt and the cat are standing behind their lecterns.]"
207,16,3,Mitt Romney,"W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago..."
208,16,3,Rick Santorum,If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-
209,16,3,Newt Gingrich,To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington.
