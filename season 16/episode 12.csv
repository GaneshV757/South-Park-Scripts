0,16,12,Randy Marsh,[excitedly] Hellooo family! [closes the door] Who wants champagne? [puts the gifts on the sofa]
1,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"[meeting him at the sofa] Randy, what is all this? [Stan and Shelly follow]"
2,16,12,Randy Marsh,"It's finally happened, Sharon! [makes to fists and draws them to his chest] I did it! [raises his fists up and lowers them quickly, then opens the gifts. He gives the first one to Sharon] Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous."
3,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"[happily] Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!"
4,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[proudly] And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now."
5,16,12,Stan Marsh,[gets his gift] We're rich?
6,16,12,Shelly Marsh,[gets her gift] Finally.
7,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, are you being serious? [smiles]"
8,16,12,Randy Marsh,I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! [Sharon frowns]
9,16,12,Stan Marsh,[somewhat confused] Blockbuster Video?
10,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?"
11,16,12,Randy Marsh,"You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition."
12,16,12,Sharon Marsh,I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
13,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?"
14,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. [they reach their destination and exit the car, and have a look at the place]"
15,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Well? There she is. [a building in the middle of a parking lot, looking nice, but silent.] It's a new beginning for us! [takes out the key to the building and goes to the front doors to open the store up. The others follow.]"
16,16,12,Shelly Marsh,[staying by the car] I don't wanna go in there.
17,16,12,Randy Marsh,Shelly come on!
18,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Can you believe it? Completely turnkey! [walks towards the shelves while his family stays by the front doors.] Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD! [returns] Well, what do you think?"
19,16,12,Stan Marsh,It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
20,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it."
21,16,12,Sharon Marsh,I didn't say anything.
22,16,12,Randy Marsh,"You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS."
23,16,12,Randy Marsh,"How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?"
24,16,12,Shelly Marsh,"Six. [picks up another DVD from a stack] We still, have, SIX. [turns and puts it on a shelf with more copies of the DVD]"
25,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly."
26,16,12,Boy,"Go get it, Fillmore! [the boys are on a low cliff across the street.]"
27,16,12,Fillmore and friend,"No way, I ain't goin' neer that place. Yeeeyou go get it. [they panic as the front door opens. Randy picks up the ball and sees them]"
28,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?"
29,16,12,Boy,What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee?
30,16,12,Randy Marsh,[annoyed] Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore! [raises his arms as if to grab something] People just don't know we're open yet!
31,16,12,Fillmore and Friend,AAAAAH! [turn right and run off]
32,16,12,Randy Marsh,[throws the ball back across the street.] Little fucking pricks. [goes back inside and closes the door.]
33,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Hello, welcome to Blockbuster! [the shopper looks through the TV series boxed sets] Can I help you find something?"
34,16,12,Shopper,I can't find... [turns her head to face Randy] Turner & Hooch. [turns back to the videos] Where's Turner & Hooch?
35,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-"
36,16,12,Shopper,Aahh... [her voice echoes as she dissolves into thin air]
37,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[stunned, then annoyed] Oh. Oh I get it! [looks heavenward] Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!"
38,16,12,Ghost,"[floats by] Emily? [turns into the aisle where the woman was] Emily, the war is over! Let's go rent a movie at Blockbuster!"
39,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!"
40,16,12,Ghost,"The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now! [floats past Randy]"
41,16,12,Randy Marsh,"I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!"
42,16,12,Ghost,"[turns around and looks at Randy] The hounds, Emily! The hounds!"
43,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy! [sticks his tongue out and makes noises at him] ""Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!"" [Stan, who doesn't see the ghost, watches from a distance] Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!"
44,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[turns and walks to Sharon, who's at the counter looking up things on the ancient CRT monitor] I think something might be wrong with Dad?"
45,16,12,Sharon Marsh,Ya think? [Stan glances up at her]
46,16,12,Butters Stotch,Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
47,16,12,Eric Cartman,We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
48,16,12,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
49,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?"
50,16,12,Butters Stotch,"I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style."
51,16,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style. [grins]"
52,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure."
53,16,12,Butters Stotch,Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
54,16,12,Eric Cartman,[walks off with Kenny] You'll just have to wait and see.
55,16,12,Sharon Marsh,I think that's good. Feel tight enough?
56,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom."
57,16,12,Sharon Marsh,Let's see the shield.
58,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[takes up the shield and strikes a pose] Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!"
59,16,12,Sharon Marsh,[claps] Yehay!
60,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[arrives] Hey, whoa, what are you doing?"
61,16,12,Sharon Marsh,Stan's about to go out with his friends.
62,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Nono, I need everybody tonight! [Stan loses his enthusiasm] It's our big night!"
63,16,12,Sharon Marsh,For what?!
64,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!"
65,16,12,Shelly Marsh,God I hate this family!
66,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, let him go trick-or-treating."
67,16,12,Randy Marsh,[walks over to some end display] You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing [a cauldron full of them] and candy corn [in a display case]. This is the night we turn it all around.
68,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[disappointed] Dad, nobody's gonna come."
69,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!"
70,16,12,Stan Marsh,Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
71,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Ew! [turns right and walks away] That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!"
72,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[moments later, on the land line] I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!"
73,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[dressed as Thor, in his living room] Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?"
74,16,12,Stan Marsh,"I know, but there's nothing I can do."
75,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,But what about the costume contest?!
76,16,12,Kenny McCormick,"[dressed as Iron Man, comes in from the kitchen] What's going on, Kyle?"
77,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan can't come.
78,16,12,Eric Cartman,"[dressed as Hulk, comes in from the kitchen] Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!"
79,16,12,Stan Marsh,I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
80,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
81,16,12,Stan Marsh,"No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him."
82,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[appears from an aisle] Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! [goes back into the aisle]"
83,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh never mind, I hate him again."
84,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?"
85,16,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
86,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea."
87,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?"
88,16,12,Stan Marsh,"How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home."
89,16,12,Eric Cartman,"This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!"
90,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,He looks fine.
91,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house."
92,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" [they head for a house to their left. Kenny rings the bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]"
93,16,12,The Boys,Trick or treat.
94,16,12,Stan Marsh,Trick or treat.
95,16,12,Man 1,"Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. [Each of the boys (except Stan) make a pose when their respective costumes are said]"
96,16,12,Eric Cartman,[dropping his pose] I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
97,16,12,Man 1,"Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh [snaps his fingers] oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... [puts his left hand to his head]"
98,16,12,Eric Cartman,The Incredible...
99,16,12,Man 1,"Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?"
100,16,12,Woman 1,"[raises her palms up, then rests them on her legs] Ohhh, cute!"
101,16,12,Eric Cartman,No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
102,16,12,Woman 1,[quick gasp] The incredible Harvey Fierstein?
103,16,12,Man 1,"Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green."
104,16,12,Eric Cartman,"The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!"
105,16,12,Man 1,The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
106,16,12,Eric Cartman,[loses his cool and shuts his eyes] JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY! [moments later they're on to the next house] It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! [Kenny rings the door bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]
107,16,12,Kenny McCormick,Trick or treat.
108,16,12,Man 2,"Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!"
109,16,12,Eric Cartman,That's right!
110,16,12,Man 2,"Oho, and Honey Boo Boo! [Cartman glares at him. The man looks back inside the house] Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume!"
111,16,12,Girlfriend,"Oh, it's getting colder out."
112,16,12,Boyfriend,"Yeah, you can definitely tell that winter's coming. [the woman glances to her right, then turns her head to the right. They both stop walking] What's the matter?"
113,16,12,Girlfriend,"That old creepy place. I saw someone in the window there. [as they look, Randy appears at one of the windows and beckons them to come in. Then he holds up a HALF OFF sign and shakes it a bit]"
114,16,12,Boyfriend,"Come on, let's get out of here. [puts his arm around her shoulders. They hurry off.]"
115,16,12,Randy Marsh,[sighs and throws down the sign in frustration] They'll come! [walks off slowly and his voice gets deeper] Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
116,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[closes his eyes and sobs a bit] Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?! [uncovers his eyes and moves his palms down to his cheeks] It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies! [places his hands on the counter] What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple. [notices something and pounds the glass] Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!"
117,16,12,Ghost 2,"[a former Blockbuster employee] Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be?"
118,16,12,Randy Marsh,I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
119,16,12,Ghost 2,Coming right up. [goes to retrieve the videos]
120,16,12,Randy Marsh,"No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak."
121,16,12,Ghost 2,"[types in the order] Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs?"
122,16,12,Randy Marsh,He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
123,16,12,Ghost 2,"If I may say so, Mr. Marsh, your Blockbuster will never get any customers with those two Negative Nancys sabotaging you. You may need to do something... rather extreme. [more sinister] If I may say so, Mr. Marsh. [Randy looks at him, then at Stan, who is off in a corner looking at his iPad.]"
124,16,12,Stan Marsh,Trick or treat.
125,16,12,Ghost 2,"You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh. [Randy feels the pressure and resists it] You must be willing to do anything."
126,16,12,Randy Marsh,No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy! [notices Stan looking at him] Hey Stan. [turns and walks away]
127,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-"
128,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Dude dude dude! Check it out. [points to something across the street... a robbery in progress. One robber is outside a Kum & Go minimart. He breaks a surveillance camera with a crowbar, then jimmies the door open and goes in]"
129,16,12,Stan Marsh,What? What's he doing?
130,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
131,16,12,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] You guys, we've gotta stop it!"
132,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,[turns around] Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
133,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, where did you guys go?"
134,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns his skateboard around] Oh, sorry dude."
135,16,12,Stan Marsh,"All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!"
136,16,12,Kenny McCormick,"Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side."
137,16,12,Eric Cartman,Cartman SMASH! [they turn around and go into action]
138,16,12,Robber 1,"All right, the camera's out. Hurry up, you two! [the other two robbers are trying to break into a Red Box rental box. They succeed, and some change falls out]"
139,16,12,Robber 2,What the? You told me these things were full of money!
140,16,12,Robber 3,"It's Halloween. I thought everyone would be renting spooky movies. [the boys break into the store, with Cartman acting like a rampaging Hulk]"
141,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,[holds up his sledge hammer] For Odin! For Asgard!
142,16,12,Robber 4,Who are you?!
143,16,12,Eric Cartman,"[roars some more, then] Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind. [walks to the counter and sees a dead clerk slumped over the counter] Holy shit, they shot this guy."
144,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God!
145,16,12,Kenny McCormick,"Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! [the boys head out the front door with the robbers in hot pursuit]"
146,16,12,Robber 4,Get 'em!
147,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable. [Randy rises up from behind the bargain bin] No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in? [Randy slides to his right and out of view] You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home. [Randy appears from the right side of the store, way in the back, then disappears again] No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really? [Randy reappears from the left side of the store, right behind Sharon] Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen. [covers the mic and turns to Randy] Can I help you with something?"
148,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[in a deep falsetto] According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. [they look at each other for a few seconds]"
149,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"[goes back to her phone call] Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy. [Randy turns around and leaves] Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know."
150,16,12,Robber 1,God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away!
151,16,12,Robber 3,"It was the Avengers, Brad! [Robber 2 appears at a doorway]"
152,16,12,Robber 2,"Hey, we caught one of them. We got him tied up in the back. [hurries to the back, and the other two follow him]"
153,16,12,Robber 1,"All right, who were your friends?"
154,16,12,Stan Marsh,Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
155,16,12,Robber 2,He's lying. They saw everything!
156,16,12,Robber 1,Let's try this again. [takes out a switchblade and walks up to the iPad]
157,16,12,Stan Marsh,"No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad! [the robber scratches the glass, leaving a deep gash] Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt"
158,16,12,Robber 4,"Hey, one of them dropped this. [a flier] It's an invitation to a Monster Mash at the community center."
159,16,12,Stan Marsh,No no! We weren't gonna go there!
160,16,12,Robber 1,[puts away the switchblade and backs off] Sure you weren't! [walks away] Get rid of him!
161,16,12,Stan Marsh,"NO! [shakes his head] I won't say anything, I promise! [Robbers 2 and 3 take the iPad out to the car]"
162,16,12,Stan Marsh,What are you gonna do? [Robber 3 takes the iPad out and carries it away] Please! Please just let me go! No!
163,16,12,Robber 3,"Sorry, kid. End of the line. [throws the iPad into a ditch next to the road. The two robbers get back into the car and drive away]"
164,16,12,Stan Marsh,What the hell? [gets off the stool and walks over to Shelly] Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
165,16,12,Shelly Marsh,"[hurriedly and worriedly looking through her duffel bag and back park] I can't find it, Somebody took it!"
166,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"[coming in from outside the store] All right Randy, where are the car keys?! [gets no answer] Randy, where are the keys to the car?! [still gets no answer. Randy is transfixed] God damn it! [walks away in a huff]"
167,16,12,Boyfriend,Did you have fun at the Halloween party?
168,16,12,Girlfriend,"I did. Thanks so much, Ben. And thanks for walking me home. [she notices something off to her right and stops]"
169,16,12,Ben and girlfriend,[the boyfriend] What's the matter?
170,16,12,Girlfriend,What is that? [lets go and walks towards the item]
171,16,12,Ben and girlfriend,Whaht is what?
172,16,12,Girlfriend,"[stops by the iPad] Somebody dumped a... Oh my God, Ben, it's a little boy! [picks up the iPad, which has Stan back onscreen] Hello? [wipes the screen clean] Are you okay? Little boy?[the screen brightens up]"
173,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?"
174,16,12,Girlfriend,It's okay. Try and stay calm.
175,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, ah thank God you found me."
176,16,12,Ben and girlfriend,What is he doing way out here?
177,16,12,Stan Marsh,You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! [Ben and his girl look at each other]
178,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend."
179,16,12,Sgt Yates,Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
180,16,12,Eric Cartman,Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
181,16,12,Sgt Yates,Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
182,16,12,Officer,"Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything."
183,16,12,Stan Marsh,They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
184,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan! [leads the other Avengers and the police into Stan's hospital room]
185,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Guys, you're okay!"
186,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,What happened to you?
187,16,12,Stan Marsh,"It's all right, just a scratch."
188,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!"
189,16,12,Stan Marsh,"No! They're looking for you there! [to Sgt. Yates] Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash."
190,16,12,Sgt Yates,"What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!"
191,16,12,Officer 2,The Monster Mash is only on Halloween. [another officer quickly shushes him]
192,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!"
193,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, people are gonna get hurt."
194,16,12,Sgt Yates,How many people at the Monster Mash?
195,16,12,Officer 3,"Most of the town, sir. It's a graveyard smash."
196,16,12,Officer 4,"Look, whatever we do, we'd better hurry. It gets on in a flash."
197,16,12,Sgt Yates,You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
198,16,12,Kenny McCormick,Yes. We saw their faces.
199,16,12,Sgt Yates,All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
200,16,12,Butters Stotch,"That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf. [a giant stops by] Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!"
201,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover."
202,16,12,Butters Stotch,"Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. [Gangnamstein turns left and runs into a man]"
203,16,12,Stan Marsh,Oops.
204,16,12,Man 3,Gaaah!
205,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, be careful in there."
206,16,12,Officer 3,[side the Gangnamstein outfit] Sorry. I can't see a thing in here.
207,16,12,Stan Marsh,"It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps."
208,16,12,A Banana,"Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that."
209,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING! [notices a video and stops] Oh look, Wedding Crashers. [takes it and carries it around, then notices Shelly and stops] What are you doing, Shelly?"
210,16,12,Shelly Marsh,"[sprays some lighter fluid onto some DVDs on a rack, then lights a match] Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. [tosses the match onto the floor]"
211,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Okay. [walks on] STAN! [Shelly squeezes some more lighter fluid onto the racks, which quickly go up in flames.] STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!"
212,16,12,Mr Mackey,"Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay."
213,16,12,Stan Marsh,Wait a minute. There they are!
214,16,12,Mr Garrison,[turns around] There's who? [the four robbers are shown]
215,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- [some rustling is heard and Randy takes Stan's iPad from him]"
216,16,12,Randy Marsh,Who are you people?! You aren't real!
217,16,12,Officer 3,"Hey hay, I can't see! Where do I go? [begins to walk blindly, and the transformation to Gangnamstein is complete]"
218,16,12,Randy Marsh,Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All! [everyone begins to run out of the community center.] I got a little somethin' for all of you! [takes a golf club from a golfer and starts swinging it around] Run! You'd better run!
219,16,12,Randy Marsh,Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
220,16,12,Family,HAAAAA! [they get off their sofa and run]
221,16,12,Randy Marsh,Haarrrr! [walks forward]
222,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Raaaawr! [falls to the floor, but gets up again]"
223,16,12,Boys,AAAAA!
224,16,12,Randy Marsh,Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!
225,16,12,Boys,"[get off the bed and run] AAAAA! [run out of the house, with Gangnamstein behind them] AAAAA!"
226,16,12,Randy Marsh,AAAAA! [a spotlight shines on Kyle's iPad] AAAAA! [Gangnamstein raises its arms to shield itself from the light. Yates and his officers have arrived and are ready to shoot]
227,16,12,Sgt Yates,FIRE! [the officers fire away]
228,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Arrrg! [looks to his left] Hey, what are you doing?!"
229,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[gaining control of his own iPad] It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! [Officer 3 takes the iPad off and throws it away while he keeps getting shot, and finally falls over dead. The gunfire stops]"
230,16,12,Sgt Yates,We got the sonofabitch!
231,16,12,Officer 5,"Wait, wasn't that Peterson in there? [Officer 2 shushes him quickly]"
232,16,12,Sgt Yates,"Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay."
233,16,12,Robber 1,Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't.
234,16,12,Butters Stotch,Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. [Kyle knows what this means and walks over to his iPad]
235,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan?
236,16,12,Stan Marsh,Hey dude.
237,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it. [the low battery indicator pops up - 5% remaining] Oh God. [turns to the gathering crowd] SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER! [turns back to Stan] Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
238,16,12,Stan Marsh,"It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK. [Kyle does so, and the indicator disappears] You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me."
239,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,You're gonna see it. [to the crowd] WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
240,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?"
241,16,12,Kenny McCormick,"Yeah, Stan?"
242,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Stay gold. [the iPad runs out of juice and the screen goes black, except for some symbols indicating the iPad needs to be recharged. Cartman roars like Hulk.]"
243,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan! [mumbles incoherently again, waving the videos he took with him in anger] Stan! [finally collapses into a snowdrift]"
244,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"I spoke with the insurance company. [the destroyed Blockbuster is shown] They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?"
245,16,12,Randy Marsh,[through frozen lips] No...
246,16,12,Sharon Marsh,You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
247,16,12,Randy Marsh,Yeah...
248,16,12,Sharon Marsh,You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
249,16,12,Randy Marsh,Okay...
250,16,12,Sharon Marsh,What do you want from McDonald's?
251,16,12,Randy Marsh,Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. [Sharon and the kids turn and walk away. Presumably Sharon has the car keys now. Stan returns and replaces the videos Randy has in his hand with the same movies on his iPad]
