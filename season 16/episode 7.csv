0,16,7,Butters Stotch,"[runs across the hallway] Fellas! Fellas! Fellas! [spots them in another hallway and runs to them] AAAAH, fellas!"
1,16,7,Stan Marsh,What? [most of the fourth grade boys gather around]
2,16,7,Butters Stotch,"[stops and catches his breath, then jabs his right index finger at the floor] Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!"
3,16,7,Eric Cartman,What?
4,16,7,Butters Stotch,[jabs his finger again] Guess!
5,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Just tell us, Butters."
6,16,7,Butters Stotch,There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
7,16,7,Craig Tucker,"Oh, we have a new cheerleader?"
8,16,7,Clyde Donovan,What's she look like?
9,16,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, what's her name?)"
10,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[taking control of the situation] Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most."
11,16,7,Butters Stotch,"Look, look, there she is. [near the bleachers opposite the doors are five girls: Red, Wendy, Bebe, Lola, and Jenny. Between Wendy and Bebe are two pompoms waiting for a sixth cheerleader, who arrives shortly. It's a black girl. The other five girls begin talking to her all at once]"
12,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked? [Token looks over at him. The girls start practicing] Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you."
13,16,7,Token Black,[anger flashes across his face] Why?! Why are you happy for me?!
14,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?"
15,16,7,Token Black,Nothing! [walks away]
16,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[confused] What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable."
17,16,7,Mr Garrison,"And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon [circles BARATHEON on the board], and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? So where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- [during the lecture, the following takes place]"
18,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[fairly whispering throughout, beginning when Mr. Garrison mentions Lord Stark. He sits between Token and the new girl and grins as he looks at each of them by turn] Dude... Token! [jerks his head a bit in the girl's direction and points at her] Token. Dude. [Token looks at him, then goes back to taking notes. Cartman smiles] Psst. Token. [points to the girl again, but puts his right hand up so she doesn't notice. Token is annoyed] Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there."
19,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[annoyed as well] Will you shut the hell up?! [goes back to taking notes. Cartman finally picks up his pen, but doesn't write anything]"
20,16,7,Eric Cartman,...Token. You want me to pass her a jelly bean?
21,16,7,Token Black,[whispers back] No!
22,16,7,Eric Cartman,Huh?
23,16,7,Token Black,[louder] No!
24,16,7,Mr Garrison,"[stops talking and turns to the class] Token, is there a problem? [Token is a loss for words, but Cartman fields this question]"
25,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis. [begins to laugh at his own joke] Right guys? [tries to hold the laugh in]"
26,16,7,Mr Garrison,"Everyone pay attention! [goes back to the board] Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- [while Garrison resumes his lesson, Cartman resumes his prodding]"
27,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[quickly looks at the girl and at Token] Token. [leans back in his seat so Token has a clear view of the girl] Dude, dude. Dude."
28,16,7,Red,"So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us."
29,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[approaching] Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?"
30,16,7,Bebe Stevens,[shuts her locker] Why?!
31,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[motions to his left] Just, can I talk to you, real quick? [walks the girls over to the end of the hallway] What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?"
32,16,7,Red,About Token? Why?
33,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know."
34,16,7,Bebe Stevens,Token likes Nichole?
35,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, of course. [the girls look at each other]"
36,16,7,Red,"Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea."
37,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?"
38,16,7,Bebe Stevens,Okay.
39,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, you guys."
40,16,7,Lola,"[moves up four steps] One two three four, sorry Bebe."
41,16,7,Bebe Stevens,"Oh, that's okay. [the girls laugh about it] So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you."
42,16,7,Lola,Ohhh.
43,16,7,Jenny Simon,Ohhh.
44,16,7,Red,Ohhh.
45,16,7,and Wendy,Ohhh.
46,16,7,Nichole,"Oh my gosh, who?"
47,16,7,Red,That boy Token.
48,16,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. [the other girls chime in, showing their support. The camera pulls back a bit, and Cartman is shown eavesdropping just outside a basement window]"
49,16,7,Nichole,"Oh jeez, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute."
50,16,7,Bebe Stevens,[excited] Who? Whowhowhowho?
51,16,7,Nichole,"That kid, with the orange coat and the green hat?"
52,16,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh, you mean Kyle?"
53,16,7,Nichole,Yeah.
54,16,7,The Girls,"Ooooh, Kyle."
55,16,7,Eric Cartman,WHAT?! KYLE?! [the girls don't hear him]
56,16,7,Bebe Stevens,Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
57,16,7,The Girls,K-I-S-S-O-M-G!
58,16,7,Nichole,"Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. [the girls laugh while Cartman gets livid]"
59,16,7,Eric Cartman,Motherfucker! [gets up and runs off]
60,16,7,The Girls,"We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows! [Cartman approaches Nichole]"
61,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, ah, Nichole, right?"
62,16,7,Nichole,Yeah. [Wendy stops practicing]
63,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here? [takes her to another set of bleachers nearby] Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?"
64,16,7,Nichole,"[taken aback] Oh no, who told you that?"
65,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know. [fakes a sweat] Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together?"
66,16,7,Nichole,Ohhh.
67,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had."
68,16,7,Nichole,"Wow, I-I'm sorry. I totally respect that. [puts her right hand on his left shoulder] Hey, thanks a lot for telling me."
69,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out."
70,16,7,Nichole,"[withdraws her hand] Oh, I'm sorry."
71,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. [snaps his fingers and walks away]"
72,16,7,Nichole,"Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here."
73,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, thanks. [smiles. Nichole turns and walks away, smiling. Kyle sees Craig and Timmy nearby and runs towards them] Dude, that new girl's into me!"
74,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Psst Butters. Butters! [Butters stops and notices, then walks over to Cartman] At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room."
75,16,7,Butters Stotch,How come?
76,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[takes off his shades] Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married."
77,16,7,Butters Stotch,"Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other."
78,16,7,Eric Cartman,"No no. [walks him towards the camera] Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push."
79,16,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. [hands her the towels]"
80,16,7,Nichole,"Oh, he does? [Butters nods] Okay."
81,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! [the boys make a break for the front of the school and exit the front doors]"
82,16,7,Craig Tucker,Where?
83,16,7,Jimmy Valmer,I-I don't see a b-b-Bat-Mobile.
84,16,7,Nichole,"[keeps walking, unaware of what Cartman just did] Hello??"
85,16,7,Token Black,[walks in dressed in a towel and drying his face with another] AAA!
86,16,7,Nichole,OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!
87,16,7,Token Black,Where is everybody? What's goin' on??
88,16,7,Nichole,"Coach wanted me to... [winces] I'm sorry. [drops the towels, turns and goes back to the doors. She tries to open them but can't]"
89,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey guys. Guys! Hold up. [runs up to the girls, who stop and turn to face him] Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?"
90,16,7,Jenny Simon,Yeah?
91,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
92,16,7,Lola,"She likes... movies, cats."
93,16,7,Jenny Simon,[to Lola] She likes basketball.
94,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!"
95,16,7,Lola,"Well- Hey Kyle, [he stops and returns] we were gonna head over to the mall. You wanna go with us?"
96,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! [runs off]"
97,16,7,Jenny Simon,Guess he has a crush on Nichole.
98,16,7,Lola,[looks away for a moment] I don't think so. I heard Kyle swings for the same team.
99,16,7,Jenny Simon,Really?!
100,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[back with Craig and Timmy] It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game. [looks back at the girls, who look at him, then giggle as he turns back to the boys] Man, I-I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. [looks back at the girls and waves. They grin and wave back]"
101,16,7,Token Black,Hey! In here! [punches the door]
102,16,7,Nichole,You think the janitors are still here?
103,16,7,Token Black,"Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. [takes her around the locker room. Nichole notices a table with food and some other things on it]"
104,16,7,Nichole,Look! [walks to the table] Somebody left a deli platter. [Token joins her] And board games. And massage oil.
105,16,7,Token Black,Oh... Good.
106,16,7,Nichole,Well that was sure an interesting night.
107,16,7,Token Black,It sure was.
108,16,7,Nichole,"Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been really scary."
109,16,7,Token Black,"Yeah. Now that it's over, I... I guess it was kind of fun. [smiles]"
110,16,7,Nichole,"Yeah, it kind of was. Maybe... I-I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow."
111,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[hiding in the bushes, weeping silently] Oh my God, sooo cute."
112,16,7,Token Black,I'd like that.
113,16,7,Nichole,Cool. Well... thanks again. [they hug each other]
114,16,7,Eric Cartman,[sweetly] Ohhhhh my God.
115,16,7,Cupid Me,"[pops out of Cartman's head] We did it, Eric. We found them each other's ray of sunshine."
116,16,7,Eric Cartman,"You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. [tickles the little cupid]"
117,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee. [pops back into Cartman's head, leaving behind a trail of hearts]"
118,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know, my heart
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart

I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?"
119,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. [behind him, on the merry-go-round, are Stan, Kenny, and Butters. Stan and Kenny are playing with a ball.]"
120,16,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, why are you so into their relationship?"
121,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, it's just so... perfect. [Stan and Kenny resume playing]"
122,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You motherfucker! [runs into view and punches Cartman, who falls on his face]"
123,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, Jesus Christ!"
124,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
125,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?"
126,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!"
127,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!"
128,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!"
129,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez? [points to a Hispanic couple riding play elephants] Is it a coincidence they ended up together?!"
130,16,7,Stan Marsh,"Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago."
131,16,7,Eric Cartman,Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that.
132,16,7,Cupid Me,"[reappears, and Cartman smiles at him] Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?"
133,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Shh, quiet, Cupid Me."
134,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
135,16,7,Eric Cartman,Nothing.
136,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,Who is Cupid Me?!
137,16,7,Eric Cartman,Nobody.
138,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
139,16,7,Eric Cartman,Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are! [can't fault him there. Nichole giggles again. Kyle looks defeated] Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
140,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,Goddamnit! [walks away angrily]
141,16,7,Dad,[clears his throat] Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.
142,16,7,Nichole,His name is Token. He's really nice.
143,16,7,Dad,Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.
144,16,7,Nichole,So?
145,16,7,Dad,"Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person."
146,16,7,Mom,"Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person."
147,16,7,William,"I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, ""Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!"""
148,16,7,Nichole,"It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence."
149,16,7,Mom,"And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey."
150,16,7,William,"Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it."
151,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Come on! [pounds on the door some more] Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry it up in there?! [pounds on the door some more. The door opens and Cupid Me floats out]"
152,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teehee."
153,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!"
154,16,7,Cupid Me,[giggles] Sorry. [Cartman goes in]
155,16,7,Eric Cartman,"That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me! [covers his nose with his bath robe] Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!"
156,16,7,Cupid Me,Teeheeheeheeheehee.
157,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, at least flush the toilet! [walks over to it] Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts."
158,16,7,Cupid Me,They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
159,16,7,Eric Cartman,"You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! [tries to catch Cupid Me, but Cupid Me keeps away]"
160,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee. [flits here and there]"
161,16,7,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna get you! [chases Cupid Me out of the bathroom]
162,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee, no! [flits on down the hall]"
163,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I almost got you! Almost! [Liane walks out of her room with clean laundry, and there's no sign of Cupid Me]"
164,16,7,Liane Cartman,"[sees Cartman dancing around] Everything okay, sweetie?"
165,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Everything's great, Mom. [to the invisible Cupid Me] No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! [dances away]"
166,16,7,Nichole,Oh no...
167,16,7,Nichole,[sad] Hey Token.
168,16,7,Token Black,[smiles and turns around] Hey Nichole.
169,16,7,Nichole,Can I talk to you for a sec?
170,16,7,Token Black,Sure! [she takes him to the same drinking fountain Kyle took Jenny and Lola to earlier] What's up?
171,16,7,Nichole,"Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out."
172,16,7,Token Black,Oh.
173,16,7,Nichole,"I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?"
174,16,7,Token Black,Okay...
175,16,7,Nichole,I think you're really great... W-w-we just...
176,16,7,Token Black,I think... you're really great.
177,16,7,Nichole,...I'm sorry.
178,16,7,Token Black,Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. [turns and walks away sadly]
179,16,7,Nichole,Okay. [she turns towards the drinking fountain]
180,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[crying inconsolably, sometimes sneezing into a tissue] It's not fair! They were so... happy!"
181,16,7,Butters Stotch,"[holding Cartman's right hand] It's gonna be okay, Eric."
182,16,7,Eric Cartman,It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
183,16,7,Butters Stotch,They'll find love somewhere else.
184,16,7,Eric Cartman,"No, they won't!"
185,16,7,Butters Stotch,"Yes, they will."
186,16,7,Eric Cartman,"No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!"
187,16,7,Cupid Me,[pops out again] Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
188,16,7,Eric Cartman,And you! I should have never believed in you!
189,16,7,Butters Stotch,"In... In who, Eric?"
190,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[grabs the imaginary cupid] I never wanna see you again! [hurls it into his closet door. It flies low. Cartman gets out of bed, grabs a bat that's conveniently leaning against his bedroom door, and bashes the cupid over and over] Take! Your sunshine! And fuckin'! Die! [puts the bat up against the door and crawls back into bed. Butters takes Cartman's hand again and Cartman resumes crying]"
191,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey man. You okay?
192,16,7,Token Black,Yeah.
193,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,[sits next to him] What happened? It just didn't work out?
194,16,7,Token Black,"Yeah, I guess."
195,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... It's done?"
196,16,7,Token Black,[long sigh] Yeah.
197,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[scratches his head behind the ear] So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?"
198,16,7,Token Black,"Yeah, we're through."
199,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?"
200,16,7,Token Black,[getting the wrong idea] I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. [gets off the bench and walks away]
201,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Huh? [suddenly remembers] Dude, what the fuck?"
202,16,7,Announcer,We'll be back with more of the Jeffersons right after this.
203,16,7,Man,"[leaves his office] I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too! [walks off. Next he's on the ground floor] I can't be constipated on the job. [stops and holds up a box] That's why I need... Soft Serve. [at a tennis court. He serves] Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough. [Cartman's interest is aroused. In the commercial the man is heading for the restroom. Another businessman comes out and the first one stops him] Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work! [now trying to poop in the toilet] 'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!"
204,16,7,Eric Cartman,"That's right... That's right! [runs up to his room, goes into his closet and digs through his stuff until he finds the shoe box he put Cupid Me into after whacking him almost to death. He takes off the lid] Ohhh. [Cupid Me is shown laying face down battered and bruised, with a dry blood stream still near his mouth] I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you."
205,16,7,Cupid Me,"No, you don't."
206,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything."
207,16,7,Cupid Me,"No, you don't. [opens its right eye for a second]"
208,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. [tickles the cupid]"
209,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teehee, stop it."
210,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do."
211,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee, teeheeheehee, [flies out of the box] teeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee."
212,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important."
213,16,7,William,"I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game."
214,16,7,Eric Cartman,Denver Nuggets game?
215,16,7,William,"Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy."
216,16,7,Eric Cartman,[dolly zoom] NOOOOOOO! [runs away quickly]
217,16,7,Announcer,"Welcome to today's matchup between the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Clippers. [the starting five from both teams take the court. A vendor hands Kyle two drinks, one of which he gives to Nichole. They look at each other fondly and take sips from their sodas.] And now, here to sing the National Anthem, country music star Brad Paisley. [he stands at center court and waves as a spotlight shines on him]"
218,16,7,Brad Paisley,"O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars-"
219,16,7,Eric Cartman,Nooooooo!
220,16,7,Announcer,"Nuggets fans, please direct your attention to center court and the president of Halitosis Kidz. [she's shown on the MegaTron waving to the spectators behind four men who are holding a Halitosis Kidz banner], who invites you to join the Denver Nuggets in the fight against morbid halitosis in children. [POV change from MegaTron to center court] Here to attempt a three-point shot for adolescents with terminally bad breath is [two of the men leave with the banner and an obese girl steps forward] the poster child for Halitosis Kidz, Stacy Muleburg. [the two other men cover their noses with their Denver team jackets as one of them hands Stacy the ball. She rushes up and throws the ball, but it's a brick] And a good try. [the two Denver men, two cameramen, the announcer, and the HK president all gather round her]"
221,16,7,Stacy Muleburg,Aaahahahaaaa.
222,16,7,Adults,Awww! [they all back away as fast as they can. The spectators clap for the effort. Kyle and Nichole clap as well]
223,16,7,Eric Cartman,[running into the center] NOOOOOOO! [triggers an alarm]
224,16,7,Guard,Tickets please.
225,16,7,Eric Cartman,No time! NOOOOOOO!
226,16,7,Announcer,"We're all set for the tipoff. [The ball is thrown into the air and a Clipper tips the ball. A Nugget - Arron Afflalo - grabs it and the game begins. Afflalo throws it to JaVale McGee for an alley-oop, and McGee makes the first shot. The crowd cheers]"
227,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Attention! Attention please! [Kyle and Nichole are surprised to hear his voice. Cartman is on the MegaTron] This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it! [Token is surprised to see Cartman there too, but Craig and Clyde are unfazed] Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands! [Nichole begins to take this in] Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. [Kyle is getting pissed off]"
228,16,7,Crowd,Awwwww. [everyone looks at Kyle]
229,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.

I swear by the moon and the stars and the sky
[Cartman and Kyle are paired on the MegaTron and the lovecam is activated - a heart appears over their images, Cartman on the left, Kyle on the right]
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear [Crowd: ""Awwww."" Kyle tries to push it all away] like the shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse [Brad appears: ""better or worse""], till death do us part [Brad: ""death do us part""]
I'll love you with [Cartman and Brad] every gay beat of my heart!"
230,16,7,Brad Paisley,"I swear, Kyle."
231,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I swear, Kyle. [the crowd erupts in applause, as do the players. Kyle leaves his seat, steaming mad]"
232,16,7,Nichole,Where are you going?
233,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! [walks away]
234,16,7,Nichole,He did that? Oh no.
235,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside. [now with urgency] Seriously you guys, you gotta see it. It's the Bat-Mobile! It's outside."
236,16,7,Spectator,"What? [leaves his seat. Soon everyone is leaving the center, including the players from both teams. Token and Nichole find themselves looking at each other just outside the bleachers]"
237,16,7,Nichole,Token. Hey.
238,16,7,Token Black,Hi.
239,16,7,Nichole,"Token, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black."
240,16,7,Token Black,I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. [they turn aside for a moment to avoid each other]
241,16,7,Both,Do you think we could... Do you still want to... [they smile at each other]
242,16,7,Nichole,Maybe we can give it another try?
243,16,7,Token Black,There are still people who will look at us funny. And think we're supposed to be together.
244,16,7,Nichole,Let them look. I don't care.
245,16,7,Token Black,"I don't care, either. [Cartman has a camera trained on them, while he takes up the whole screen on the MegaTron, praying for this to work out]"
246,16,7,Nichole,I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter.
247,16,7,Token Black,YAY! [they run to each other and hug each other]
248,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh my gohhhd, so cute! [runs out of the control room. Cupid Me appears]"
249,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place."
250,16,7,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together."
251,16,7,Cupid Me,"That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you!"
252,16,7,Eric Cartman,Really?!
253,16,7,Cupid Me,"There she is! [points to Stacy, who turns around and growls at Cartman, showing her rotten teeth]"
254,16,7,Eric Cartman,"What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!"
255,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you! [gives him the finger and then goes and shoots some arrows onto Stacy's face. Stacy's pupils become hearts]"
256,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, stop it!"
257,16,7,Stacy Muleburg,Haaagh! [Cartman spins around and runs. Stacy gives chase]
258,16,7,Eric Cartman,Nooo!
259,16,7,Stacy Muleburg,Haahahaagh!
