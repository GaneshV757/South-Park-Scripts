0,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on. Throw the football, Ike."
1,4,16,Ike Broflovski,[picks up the football] No on dahdo. [the football weighs him down and he sinks into the snow. Kyle rushes forward]
2,4,16,Stan Marsh,[rushes up with Cartman and Kenny] Dude! [Kyle looks] You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
3,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Hepatitis B?
4,4,16,Eric Cartman,"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!"
5,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
6,4,16,Stan Marsh,We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
7,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,[withdraws] Hold on. I'll be right back. [turns and runs into the house]
8,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?"
9,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"No, Kyle."
10,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,But all the guys are going!
11,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile."
12,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"But Mom, I-"
13,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"The answer is no, Kyle!"
14,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh! [turns right and walks out]
15,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,My parents said I can't go.
16,4,16,Stan Marsh,"[blinks at Cartman, who blinks back] Well, of course your parents said you can't go!"
17,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!"
18,4,16,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
19,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks down] Ah. Oh, now I already told them."
20,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess you're screwed, then. [walks away with the other two]"
21,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. [turns and runs back into the house. Ike finally throws the football off and looks out from the snow]
22,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!"
23,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!"
24,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,What's Cuba?
25,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
26,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?"
27,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,The whole thing.
28,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh, geez. [walks away]"
29,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Dear Mr. Castro: [thinks] I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
30,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
[Castro sees a drawing of a sad Kyle holding a flower, which fades to a sad Kyle writing his letter]
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
[Kyle finishes a drawing of a sad rainbow coalition atop a world globe]
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
[Castro see a drawing of a sad Kyle inside a small house]
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
[A picture of Kyle replaces his self-portrait on the paper]
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
[Kyle finishes one last drawing of himself, which Castro sees last]
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish."
31,4,16,Fidel Castro,¡¡Llamen a todos junto!!
32,4,16,Reporter,"Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter. [A shot of Kyle behind a wooden fence comes up] Now the country is again open to American tourism. [shot of Sheila and Gerald stunned] Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba. [Sheila and Gerald look at each other]"
33,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,[exults] I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
34,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,No you can't!
35,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[wounded, turns] What??"
36,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it."
37,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!"
38,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert."
39,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,But that's not fair! You lied to me!
40,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-"
41,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
42,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,Because we're your parents!
43,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Well I wish I didn't have any parents! [walks to the front door, opens it, and exits]"
44,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle!
45,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
46,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it."
47,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
48,4,16,Eric Cartman,"[smoothly] Well, you... could make them... go away for a while."
49,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,How?!
50,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away."
51,4,16,Stan Marsh,The police?
52,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you."
53,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
54,4,16,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months."
55,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,[awed] Wow! Three months without parents!
56,4,16,Kenny McCormick,"(Wow, that is awesome!)"
57,4,16,Stan Marsh,But what do the police do to them?
58,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
59,4,16,Eric Cartman,"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like, [slight whine] ""my parents molestered me."""
60,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[straight] ""My parents molestered me."""
61,4,16,Eric Cartman,"No, but you've gotta cry, like this: [starts a fake sob, rubs his eyes] ""My parents molestered me."" [stops the fake cry] And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say [rolls his eyes as he thinks] ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait, [points] you say it was a bad touch."
62,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"What's ""bad touch""?"
63,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch."""
64,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, molestered, bad touch."
65,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, And cry. [Kyle lets out a soft cry] Oh, he's ready."
66,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that."
67,4,16,Case Worker,"[female] You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right."
68,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Ugh, please, just listen to me! [Cartman chuckles as Kyle's parents are taken to the back door of a squad car] What about my children? Who will take care of them?"
69,4,16,Case Worker,"Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother."
70,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Their grandmother's been dead for three years. [she is put into the back seat, and the door is shut. The window is rolled down] You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your- [the window is raised so her voice can't be heard clearly] mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!"
71,4,16,Case Worker,[walks up to Kyle] They'll never be able to hurt you again. [picks Kyle up and hugs him]
72,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Cool, thanks."
73,4,16,Case Worker,"[drops Kyle and stands up] Alright, folks. Our work here is done. [police cars doors close, police cars zoom away, and everyone else disperses]"
74,4,16,Stan Kyle,[Cartman grins] Alright! [high-five each other]
75,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too."
76,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!"
77,4,16,Kids,"Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!"
78,4,16,TV Announcer,The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
79,4,16,Eric Cartman,"[slides up in front of the others] You guys! Come out here! [walks out the door. The other two follow, leaving Ike alone on the sofa.]"
80,4,16,Stan Marsh,What's going on?
81,4,16,Eric Cartman,Notice anything? [before them the town sits empty as the sun sits between two mountains in a red sky.] Watch. [takes a stone and throws it hard. It flies through the air and goes through a first-floor window on a building two blocks away]
82,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,...Nothing.
83,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town. [more kids gather] They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested"
84,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Not one adult left?
85,4,16,Stan Marsh,[steps forward] ...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
86,4,16,Woman,"Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are."
87,4,16,Man,I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?
88,4,16,Woman,There has to be a town around here somewhere.
89,4,16,Man,Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
90,4,16,Woman,"Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. [both of them are suddenly shocked as the engine begins to falter]"
91,4,16,Man,"What the? [the speedometer goes down to 0 and the car begins to hobble] Oh no. No, no, no, no."
92,4,16,Woman,What's the matter with it?
93,4,16,Man,"[worried] I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles."
94,4,16,Woman,"Oh, look! There's a town up ahead. [the signpost for South Park appears, but ""SMiLEy ToWN"" appears in yellow over it. Underneath the sign, a clown mask appears while four balloons] Smiley Town? That's a strange name."
95,4,16,Man,"Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles. [they pass the sign.]"
96,4,16,Woman,Hello? Is anybody here? [so rustling is heard and Butters emerges from the garage in a mechanic's suit]
97,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?"
98,4,16,Man,"...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car."
99,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?"
100,4,16,Man,...It's... just you here?
101,4,16,Butters Stotch,"No, uh Craig's here, too."
102,4,16,Man,"Oh, good."
103,4,16,Butters Stotch,"But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! [Craig exits the office wearing a space outfit complete with helmet]"
104,4,16,Craig Tucker,[approaches] What?
105,4,16,Man,"Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?"
106,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Huuuhhhh, no."
107,4,16,Man,How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
108,4,16,Butters Stotch,Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
109,4,16,Man,Fine! Can you take us there?
110,4,16,Craig Tucker,You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
111,4,16,Woman,Yes.
112,4,16,Butters Stotch,Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
113,4,16,Man,Yes.
114,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, alright then. [to Craig] Uh, show 'em where it is."
115,4,16,Craig Tucker,"[stops just short of the line] This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line."
116,4,16,Man,"Well, can you help us find the phone, please?"
117,4,16,Craig Tucker,Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
118,4,16,Woman,Why not?!
119,4,16,Man,"Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games."
120,4,16,Craig Tucker,Craig.
121,4,16,Man,What?
122,4,16,Craig Tucker,"It's Spaceman Craig. [walks away slowly, deliberately, making sci-fi sound effects as he walks. Linda and her husband look at each other baffled. They then walk forward...]"
123,4,16,Two Small Voices,"[off screen] Carousel. [the couple notices a shadow between two buildings. The shadow moves away quickly, and the couple walks on. More ominous music comes up as the walking resumes walking]"
124,4,16,More Voices,"Nah nah nanah nah! [a post falls over, scaring Linda into her husband's arms]"
125,4,16,Man,"Look, there's an elementary school [the school has been renamed Treasure Cove Elementary, and it is extremely trashed] Come on, there might be some teachers inside. [the couple heads for the school, but a toy Mega zips by them]"
126,4,16,Linda Cotner,"[holds on to her husband]What is that? [the truck turns around and comes back]WAAH [raises a foot to avoid being hit by the truck. The truck goes down the street, then turns around and returns once more, stopping in front of the frightened couple]What do you want from us??"
127,4,16,Man,"Linda, it's a remote-controlled car. [the truck repositions itself] Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it. [the couple is seen in a little monitor inside the school. The truck does have a camera in it]"
128,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Mark, I don't like this."
129,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Relax, Linda, everything's fine. [looks closer at the truck. A little index finger presses on a button named Lemmin Juice. The truck ejects a stream of juice] Ow. [squirt] Ow. [rubs his eyes]"
130,4,16,Linda Cotner,[panicking] What is it?! Acid?!
131,4,16,Mark Cotner,"No, uh, it's lemon juice."
132,4,16,Linda Cotner,Oh God! Are you blind?!
133,4,16,Mark Cotner,"No, it just really, really, really hurts!"
134,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Mark? Mark, look. [Mark rubs his eyes, then blinks them to focus. Before him is a line of kindergartners. The two sides stare at each other, then a girl steps forward] Well, hello. What's your name? [the girl just looks back at her] What- what do you want?"
135,4,16,Jenny,We wanna play.
136,4,16,Linda Cotner,"[panicked, rises] Mark, I'm scared!"
137,4,16,Mark Cotner,[rises] Don't be scared. They're just kids. [to the kindergartners] Where are your parents?!
138,4,16,Filmore,We already played with our parents.
139,4,16,Jenny,"How, we wanna play wit' youuuu. [points at the couple]"
140,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[silence] ...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out."
141,4,16,Kindergartners,[come at the couple all at once] We wanna play wit' you! [jump on the couple]
142,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Get off me! [twirls, but the kids don't fall off]"
143,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Oh God, Mark! Help! [the couple goes towards the dividing line between Smiley Town and Treasure Cove]"
144,4,16,Filmore,[clinging onto Linda] Oh no! She's crossing the white line!
145,4,16,Kindergartners,Whoa! [fall off the couple and quickly rise to cross the line back to Treasure Cove. Spitballs come flying at them]
146,4,16,Kindergartner,"Spitwads! [the launchers are seen: the sixth graders, Pip, Clyde, and Craig, with their straws.]"
147,4,16,Craig Tucker,"[space helmet off] Take that, kindergartners!"
148,4,16,Kindergartners,Ew! [all turn to leave. Jenny is the last to go. The older kids and the couple watch them leave]
149,4,16,Mark Cotner,What the hell is gong on here?!
150,4,16,Craig Tucker,[space helmet back on] Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.
151,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!"
152,4,16,Craig Tucker,I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
153,4,16,Mark Cotner,The mayor! Good! Finally!
154,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please? [Mark and Linda look at each other] Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions."
155,4,16,Linda Cotner,You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
156,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Parents? [his left-hand assistant (Francis) whispers in his ear and withdraws] Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around."
157,4,16,Mark Cotner,No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
158,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!"
159,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?"
160,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service."
161,4,16,Mark Cotner,"No phones, either? How do you communicate?"
162,4,16,Eric Cartman,"[opens up an empty jar and speaks into it] Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. [closes the lid on the jar as Francis waits on him and hands the jar to Francis. He hops down and goes out the door]"
163,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? [the boy returns with the jar and hands it back to Cartman, who opens it up again]"
164,4,16,Butter s Voice,"It's gonna be about three days. [Cartman looks at the couple, who stand speechless]"
165,4,16,Eric Cartman,"[tosses the jar aside, and it breaks] So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. [moves a plate of treats forward] Ringy-ding?"
166,4,16,Mark Cotner,I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
167,4,16,Francis,SpitBall!
168,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Aaahh! [jumps from his chair a second before a huge spitball crashes through the window and lands on the floor. He picks himself off the floor and goes to look out the window angrily] You sons of bitches! [turns to the couple] You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. [Mark and Linda, both unsure, look at each other]"
169,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Mark, are we doing the right thing?"
170,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!"
171,4,16,Linda Cotner,I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
172,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[stops and scolds] Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!"
173,4,16,Linda Cotner,"[encouraging] Hey, I think you'd make a great father."
174,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D- [moves forward again. Before them is a 20-ft John Elway statue.] Look, here's the book they've been talking about- [softly] it makes no sense."
175,4,16,Linda Cotner,"My God! Mark! [in front of the statue is a small altar on which sit two kids. A dead dog is on the ground, and off to one side is a dead Kenny. Mark approaches him and inspects him closely] What is it??"
176,4,16,Mark Cotner,"It's a boy. [reaches down to touch Kenny. Kenny's left hand and arm have been eaten away, leaving only the bones. Kenny's head turns when Mark touches him, and only the skull remains] They... killed him."
177,4,16,Linda Cotner,"The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here."
178,4,16,Kindergartners,Nah nah nanah nah!
179,4,16,Linda Cotner,Na-a-ah! [older kids in costume enter the park and line up behind the kindergartners]
180,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Oh no! [they both turn, only to face another group of kids. Both groups close in on them]"
181,4,16,Linda Cotner,Mark!
182,4,16,Mark Cotner,[to the kids] Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. [the angry mod captures them]
183,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[wakes up first] Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up! [Mark awakens and both look at the group of kids, from kindergartners to fifth graders, staring back]"
184,4,16,Kids,Nah nah nanah nah! [close in on the couple again]
185,4,16,Stan Marsh,"You guys, stop it! [glides down from a tall pole in the school gym and jumps to a spot in front of the couple] Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes."
186,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,[emerges from the group and stands next to Stan] Yeah. [these two head Treasure Cove]
187,4,16,Mark Cotner,Why are you doing this?
188,4,16,Stan Marsh,How come you wanna help the fatass?!
189,4,16,Mark Cotner,Who?
190,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,The fatass. The mayor.
191,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than- [struggles to view his watch, but finally does] -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore."
192,4,16,Stan Marsh,"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!"
193,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?"
194,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that."
195,4,16,Linda Cotner,But what about before that?
196,4,16,Stan Marsh,"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?"
197,4,16,Linda Cotner,Yes!!
198,4,16,Stan Marsh,"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?"
199,4,16,Mark Cotner,I'll do anything to get to a phone!
200,4,16,Stan Marsh,Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
201,4,16,Kids,The Before time.
202,4,16,Boy,The story of the before time.
203,4,16,Stan Marsh,"[with a torch, walks up to a chalk drawing on a wall of a family] Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. [a drawing of broccoli is shown]"
204,4,16,Kids,"Yuck, yuck, yuck."
205,4,16,Stan Marsh,"[walks past a drawing of Cartman] And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. [stops at a drawing of two police officers arresting an adult, with a squad car in the background], by using the magic M word. [a large M is shown]"
206,4,16,Kids,Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
207,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. [a drawing of a statue]"
208,4,16,Kids,Provider. Provider.
209,4,16,Stan Marsh,"The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. [an angry Provider shoots bolts of lightning from his body, and two victims are at his feet]"
210,4,16,Kids,Boo!
211,4,16,Boy,Bwack bwack!
212,4,16,Kids,Coosh!
213,4,16,Stan Marsh,"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. [the two books are shown, with the line between them]"
214,4,16,Kids,"Carousel, Carousel."
215,4,16,Stan Marsh,"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago."
216,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?"
217,4,16,Stan Marsh,Yes. No foolies.
218,4,16,Kids,No foolies.
219,4,16,Mark Cotner,"No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on. [pushes the front door of the school and it falls away] Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone."
220,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Mark, I'm scared. [holds on to him]"
221,4,16,Mark Cotner,"I know, but this will all be over soon."
222,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!"
223,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?"
224,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, it's awful! Just awful."
225,4,16,Speaker,"Alright parents, let's all take our seats. [Gerald and Sheila sit] My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor."
226,4,16,Randy Marsh,"Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child."
227,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Eh, neither did we."
228,4,16,Mrs McCormick,"We didn't, either."
229,4,16,Mr Evans,"Enough, enough! [all fall silent] Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most. [walks off and brings back a life-size stand-up of ""Beaver"" Cleaver] Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him. [no response from the inmates] Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body."
230,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!"
231,4,16,Mr Evans,"Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!"
232,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,I don't have any urges!
233,4,16,Mr Evans,"I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down! [Gerald thinks a moment, then sits down] Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu. [the adults remain silent, no objections] Now let's try again. [genuflects] Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!"
234,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. [reaches the gas station and is horrified by what she sees. The couple's car has been placed on blocks and thoroughly stripped of its parts. Butters comes out from behind the car with a window handle]"
235,4,16,Butters Stotch,"I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper."
236,4,16,Linda Cotner,[backs up] Oh no. NO! [turns around and stops in her tracks.] Aaaah! [Cartman's group faces her]
237,4,16,Eric Cartman,Where is your husband?
238,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Uh, uh..."
239,4,16,Eric Cartman,Seize her! [the others move forth]
240,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Alright, I got the book for you. [hands it to Stan]"
241,4,16,Stan Marsh,[receives it] Awesu-home!
242,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Now, can I please have the cell phone?"
243,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Sure, outlander. I'll get it [starts to move...]"
244,4,16,Eric Cartman,[outside] Outlander! [all look in the direction of the sound]
245,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!"
246,4,16,Butters Stotch,Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
247,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Butters, calm down, alright?"
248,4,16,Mr Evans,"Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?"
249,4,16,Man,[in back row] See a movie?
250,4,16,Mr Evans,"Sure, ""see a movie""'s good. [writes it down on the blackboard] We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?"
251,4,16,Mrs McCormick,Make a sweater?
252,4,16,Mr Evans,"Uh huh. I'll put ah, ""knitting, sewing."" [writes them down] Who's got another one?"
253,4,16,Blond Man,[to Liane's left] Molest children?
254,4,16,Mr Evans,"Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children."
255,4,16,Blond Man,Oh. Fishing?
256,4,16,Mr Evans,Fishing's good. Uh huh. [writes that down]
257,4,16,Eric Cartman,"I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! [gives her a small shock]"
258,4,16,Linda Cotner,Mmrrhhhh!
259,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Heh, heheh."
260,4,16,Linda Cotner,Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
261,4,16,Mark Cotner,Give him the book back.
262,4,16,Stan Marsh,"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!"
263,4,16,Eric Cartman,"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!"
264,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! [goes to ungag his wife, and the statue's clock begins to peal: 8:00 p.m. An electric current makes its way down to a pool of water and returns to the statue, electrifying it. The right arm, holding a football, moves forward]"
265,4,16,Eric Cartman,The Provider awakes!
266,4,16,Stan Marsh,"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight."
267,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Alright. [gets formal] It is decided. [points, in normal voice] Butters, your turn. [other kids back away. Tweek and another boy take Butters away.]"
268,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!"
269,4,16,Mark Cotner,Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
270,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word."
271,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too."
272,4,16,Mark Cotner,What? [Butters makes his way to the altar on the dividing line. Tweek and three others monitor him]
273,4,16,Butters Stotch,"I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! [Tweek and the other three chain him up]"
274,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!"
275,4,16,Stan Marsh,[all the kids turn from the altar and face the couple] Parents?
276,4,16,Mark Cotner,"The birth-givers! Your birth-givers. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now. [beings to walk into the mob of kids] They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much. [Filmore and Jenny look at each other. Cartman gazes] Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this! [motions to the statue of John Elway] He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will."
277,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Parents. Mom. Dad.
278,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh boy, here it comes!"
279,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[moves through the crowd again] If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. [stands next to Linda]"
280,4,16,Stan Marsh,"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around."
281,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
282,4,16,Mark Cotner,Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
283,4,16,Eric Cartman,Take him down. [Tweek and the other three unchain Butters]
284,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway."
285,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Here's our cell phone, dude. [hands it to Mark] Will you call the police for us? [Mark begins dialing]"
286,4,16,Linda Cotner,Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
287,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some."
288,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! [turns around and starts walking away. Mark is surprised]"
289,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!"
290,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
291,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner."
292,4,16,Linda Cotner,"[shows up with Mark] Hey, kids."
293,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you guys came back!"
294,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Did you make it to your job interview?
295,4,16,Mark Cotner,Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
296,4,16,Linda Cotner,And I got my tubes tied.
297,4,16,Kids,Alright!
298,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are."
299,4,16,Kids,Yeah.
300,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Hey! Here they come! [the sound of a bus is heard. It pulls up and the parents pour out, beginning with the Broflovskis]"
301,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Mom! Dad!
302,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,Kids! [all the parents rush to their kids and hug them]
303,4,16,Parents,"...Come here, come here."
304,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"[holds Ike] Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK. [Gerald hold Kyle]"
305,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. We're fine.
306,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now."
307,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,But you didn't do anything to me.
308,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it."
309,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,It won't happen again. [She and Gerald turn and walk off with Ike.]
310,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[lags] But, you guys, I--"
311,4,16,Sharon Marsh,"[she and Randy hold Stan] Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't."
312,4,16,Liane Cartman,"[genuflects next to Cartman] We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see."
313,4,16,Stephen Stotch,"We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on."
314,4,16,Butters Stotch,Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
315,4,16,Mrs McCormick,"[walks with Stuart] Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he?"
316,4,16,Jenny s Mother,"[she and the father hold Jenny] Everything's gonna be alright now, Jenny. [Jenny's father lets go] Come on, let's go home. [the families begin to disperse. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stay behind.]"
317,4,16,Stan Marsh,Huh.
318,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Huh.
319,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[walks up with Linda] Well, what are you kids gonna do now?"
320,4,16,Stan Marsh,I dunno. [to Kyle and Cartman] You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
321,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Sure. [the boys turn left and start walking]
322,4,16,Eric Cartman,Snow igloos kick ass. [Mark and Linda stare as if the events of the last ten days didn't leave an impression on the boys]
