2,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Me too. We were lucky to get tickets. [calls out] Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. [the boys, dressed in their Sunday best, walk in with heads down in resentment]"
3,4,4,Liane,"Oh, don't they look precious?"
4,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns"
5,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things.."
6,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Awwww!
7,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,[rolls up] Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!
8,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!"
9,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each others' faces!"
10,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Come on, everybody, let's go. [the others turn and head out the front door.]"
11,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"[follows] Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man."
12,4,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, this is so exciting"
13,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley."
14,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Where? [a clown appears next to him, and he looks up] Oh, no. [the clown pulls out an umbrella and a bicycle horn, squeezes the horn and gets showered by the umbrella. The adults laugh, and the clown offers him the umbrella] Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye. [the clown insists Stan take part, and the parents laugh at the sound of the horn] No, thank you. [the clown tries again] Go away, please."
15,4,4,Eric Cartman,"He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it! [Liane smacks him on the back of the head] Ow. [the clown tries once more with Stan. Stan rolls his eyes, takes the umbrella, and is showered by it when the clown presses the horn. The crowd roars with laughter as the clown revels in his cleverness]"
16,4,4,Randy Marsh,"You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? [Stan looks up angrily]"
17,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[comments] Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! [the clown gets mad as Cartman talks, then takes the umbrella from Stan and walks away in a huff]"
18,4,4,Announcer,"[affecting a French accent] Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu"
19,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[echoes the announcer] Sarque du Son Bleu. [sticks his tongue out. A performer comes out and starts singing] Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain."
20,4,4,Liane,"Eric, sshhhh. [the performer is joined by men rolling by in wheels behind him and others prancing by in front. The parents smile in awe]"
21,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,How long does this thing last?
22,4,4,Stan Marsh,Two hours.
23,4,4,Eric Cartman,Awwwgh.
24,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Awwwgh.
25,4,4,Kenny McCormick,Awwwgh.
26,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are curious. Each of the quints lays on her stomach and puts her feet over her back and on her head.]"
27,4,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Woohoo!) [Stan and Kyle stir, and Kyle nudges Cartman]"
28,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? [the quints pile on to make an X, then roll off and reposition themselves into a circle]"
29,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa. [a few twirls, and the middle one is thrust into the air. The two girls on the outside leap up and land on the other two's heads and catch the middle girl, to form a pentagon. Then they form a large cat, then a yacht,...]"
30,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude. [...then the Eiffel Tower, and finally, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The crowd cheers]"
31,4,4,Stan Marsh,Yayy!
32,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yayy!
33,4,4,Eric Cartman,Yayy!
34,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
35,4,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, that was wonderful!"
36,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again."
37,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
38,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!"
39,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!"
40,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! [they pass ""LE SOUVENIRS,"" a booth manned by a clown dressed in yellow.]"
41,4,4,Clown in yellow,"[the boys turn to see him] Don't forget to buy your souvenirs, folks. [the adults gather and clamor for the items on display. As they do, the boys talk]"
42,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?"
43,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash."
44,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville."
45,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
46,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. [the boys turn to leave]"
47,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Let's go practice. [they exit]
48,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold."
49,4,4,A Quint,"Did we do good final show, Grandmama?"
50,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much. [a knock on the dressing room door, and two stern men walk in]"
51,4,4,Romanian official,"Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania."
52,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready. [the men leave, and she looks to the dressing room window. She walks over, opens the window, turns, and] This way, girls. Quickly. [the girls head for the window. Grandmama lifts them out one by one.]"
53,4,4,Quint 2,"Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?"
54,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance. [drops the girl off outside]
55,4,4,Romanian official,Nid kelmin da bushka.
56,4,4,Attendant,Nid kelmin da lushka velt
57,4,4,Romanian official,"Nid kelmin da bushka ayn zolt! [the men laugh, the attendant looks at his watch]"
58,4,4,Attendant,M-Mrs. Vladchick? [the men enter and find the open window and no one at all]
59,4,4,Romanian official,Dash fam da bushka!
60,4,4,Attendant,They're trying to defect! [they rush up to the end of a dock just as Mrs. Vladchick and her granddaughters take off in a dinghy]
61,4,4,Romanian official,"[pumping a fist] Cauch! We need a boat. [sees two native men in a canoe, about to leave. He and the attendant walk over to them and gives one of the paddlers some money]"
62,4,4,Native paddler in vest,"Where to, Mack?"
63,4,4,Romanian official,"[gets on the canoe] Follow that boat. [the attendant gets on, and the four men paddle away]"
64,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this isn't working."
65,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,It's Kenny's singing!
66,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Hunh?)
67,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!"
68,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(I'm singing as good as I can!)
69,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! [Grandpa rolls by and notices the boys in dance poses]"
70,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders."
71,4,4,Romanian Official,"There's nowhere to go, Mrs. Vladchick. Pull over! [the canoe has caught up to the dinghy. Mrs. Vladchick looks back, then looks forward. They are closing in on a dock full of explosives, and she looks on in horror]"
72,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Okay girls, the Cam Ay Alta. [the girls pile on Grandmama and form a tower, each female grabbing the head of the one below her. The top girl grabs a branch with a free hand, and all swing up in the air as one. The dinghy goes on with the canoe in pursuit]"
73,4,4,Romanian Official,"[In a high pitched voice] Be careful, Gabul! Be careful, Gabul! Yaaah! [the canoe runs into the dock and they both blow up. Pieces of the four men fall from the air.]"
74,4,4,Top Girl,"Did we do good, Grandmama?"
75,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Very good, Glacas."
76,4,4,Stan Marsh,"I'm tired, Grandpa."
77,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more MacGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya. [the doorbell rings] Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night?"
78,4,4,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. [walks over and opens the door] Whoa. [before him are the contorting Romanian quintuplets and their Grandmama, all shivering. Randy and Sharon show up in their pajamas]"
79,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
80,4,4,Randy Marsh,You're from Cirque du Cheville. [Grandpa shows up]
81,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
82,4,4,Randy Marsh,Well...
83,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. [the girls grin and enter]"
84,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Oh, thank you so much. [walks in]"
85,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....?"
86,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,Vladchick. [Sharon escorts her and the girls upstairs]
87,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.
88,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!"
89,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Well, it's good for 'im."
90,4,4,Kenny McCormick,"[reads ""Learning to Sing Better""] (Let's see... No, not there) [tosses the book away and picks up ""The Essence of Voicing""] (Let's see. Nothing there) [tosses it away and picks up ""Singing like Bocelli for Dummies""] (Let's see... here!) [pulls out a tape and pops it into his tape player]"
91,4,4,"""Singing like Bocelli for Dummies"" Narrator","Hello, and welcome to: ""Singing like Bocelli for Dummies."" Lesson 1: Yaaayayeha!"

94,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Hehyayaya hehyayaya!)
95,4,4,"""Singing like Bocelli for Dummies"" Narrator","Good: And now we'll do the entire piece, ""Con Te Partirт"" [music begins to play]"
96,4,4,Kenny McCormick,"[leafs through the book] (Con Te Partirт?) [leafs some more and find it. A rat crawls onto the bed as Kenny looks at the tape player, looks around and leaves. Kenny immediately improves and begins singing like a Prima Divo, yet still characteristically Kenny-muffled...](...Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivrт. 'Con te...)[...and it becomes background music as the camera pans over to...]"
97,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(...partirт.)
98,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"[startles Grandmama] Got everything you need there, do ya?"
99,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Su navi per mari)
100,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,Yes. You're avefully soo kind to my little granddaughters.
101,4,4,Kenny McCormick,"(che, io lo so,)"
102,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"They're quite agile little things, aren't they?"
103,4,4,Kenny McCormick,"(no, no, non esistono piщ.)"
104,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Yes, as I was back in my day. I was a contortionist, too."
105,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(con te io li rivivrт.)

111,4,4,Kenny McCormick,"(...partirт.Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.)[as Kenny sings, Grandpa returns to Mrs. Vladchick's room naked... and without the wheelchair. She lifts up her left leg over her head, then lets it go. Kenny's getting into the song. The tape speeds up a bit...]'(Io con te...!)"
112,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Ah. [A leg wraps around his chest] Oh. [a second leg wraps around his head] Ah! [an arm appears, then Mrs. Vladchick's head, then a third leg...] Oh. [Kenny is seen on bended knee on his bed during the last note, as Grandmama Vladchick and Grandpa reach climax.] Oh-oooh-oooh!"
113,4,4,"""Singing like Bocelli for Dummies"" Narrator",And now lesson 4: the complete works of Mozart. Let's begin.
114,4,4,Kenny McCormick,[looks at the radio] (Damn!)
115,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer."
116,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping."
117,4,4,Sharon Marsh,Poor dear must be tired.
118,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,[rolls in] You're damn right she's tired.
119,4,4,Randy Marsh,Huh?
120,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. [rolls out]."
121,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Hurry up, you guys!"
122,4,4,Eric Cartman,What's going on?
123,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you're not gonna believe this."
124,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! [they all turn, and the quints stand before them]"
125,4,4,Quint 1,Hello.
126,4,4,Quint 2,Hello.
127,4,4,Quint 3,Hi.
128,4,4,Quint 4,Hello.
129,4,4,Eric Cartman,No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
130,4,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
131,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What's a ""quin-tuplet""?"
132,4,4,Quint 2,"Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two."
133,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,But there's only four of you.
134,4,4,Quint 2,"No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia."
135,4,4,Nadia,[steps out from behind Natalia] Hello.
136,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?"
137,4,4,All five quints in unison,"No, don't be ridiculous."
138,4,4,Stan Marsh,Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
139,4,4,A Quint,You have your own?
140,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first."
141,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Hey!)
142,4,4,Eric Cartman,"But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!"
143,4,4,Quint 1,Okay.
144,4,4,Quint 3,Sounds good.
145,4,4,Quint 2,Count me in.
146,4,4,Quint 5,"Okay. [quint 4 says nothing, and the others look at her]"
147,4,4,Quint 4,"...Oh, and me."
148,4,4,The boys,All right!
149,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up. [leaves, reaches Grandmama's room, and knocks] Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman? [knocks twice more] Ma'am? [opens the door, looks in, and flies are heard buzzing around. Mrs. Vladchick is stiff, mouth open, arms up as if holding someone. Randy shuts the door in horror, then opens it and looks in again to be sure, then shuts it again, horrified]"
150,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"[rolls up] Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha."
151,4,4,Randy Marsh,"[serious] No, Dad."
152,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.
153,4,4,Randy Marsh,"No, Dad, she's dead!"
154,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"What?! [Randy opens the door and looks away, Grandpa rolls in to see for himself] Oh, dear Jesus!"
155,4,4,Randy Marsh,It looks like she had a heart attack.
156,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,No wonder she didn't say good-night.
157,4,4,Randy Marsh,"[stares at him, then leans away] ...Ew!"
158,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, hold it, hold it. [climbs over Cartman and Kyle to form a tower. The quintuplets have executed their X formation. Stan is trying to stand when all three boys tumble to the ground. The quints break their formation and drop down]"
159,4,4,The boys,Ow! [Randy and Sharon walk out and approach the kids]
160,4,4,Sharon Marsh,I don't know how to tell. You tell them. [they stop]
161,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Uh, girls, we... have some bad news."
162,4,4,Quint 5,What?
163,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Um... [Sharon holds his hand] Everyone who has a grandma, step forward. [Stan and Cartman step forward, then the girls] Uh, not so fast, girls. [Sharon gasps and glares at him. The girls step back, then realize what has just happened. They begin to sob]"
164,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Randy! [amid the sobs, some of the quints have questions]"
165,4,4,Quint 2,Grandmama is dead?
166,4,4,Quint 1,What are we going to do now? [Randy and Sharon stand there helplessly]
167,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[in a low voice] You guys, come here. [steps forward. The others join him] This is totally awesome."
168,4,4,Stan Marsh,What?!
169,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,How can you say that?
170,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!"
171,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, yeah!"
172,4,4,Stan Marsh,[rushes up] Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
173,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Well, Stan, it's not really our-"
174,4,4,Stan Marsh,They have nowhere else to go. [presses hands together] Please?
175,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay."
176,4,4,Stan Marsh,Hooray!
177,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hooray!
178,4,4,Eric Cartman,Hooray!
179,4,4,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes. [someone takes a picture] If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more [""FEED THE QUINTS! One Dollar"" A man buys some fishsticks], you can feed them fishsticks."
180,4,4,A Quint,"[hops up and down, then opens her mouth for a fishstick the man drops down to her] Mmm."
181,4,4,Reporter,"Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania."
182,4,4,Reporter,"Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world. [a last shot of the quints is seen] Back to you, Tom."
183,4,4,President,This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.
184,4,4,Romanian Official,This could kill our tourism.
185,4,4,President,You know what to do. [they salute him and leave.]
186,4,4,Instructor,"[at the piano] Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises. [plays the sequence C E G C G E C]"
187,4,4,Kenny McCormick,[sings along] (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) [his mom looks on. The instructor and Kenny move on to the D and E scales.]
188,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?"
189,4,4,Instructor,"Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be."
190,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(I wanna be really good)
191,4,4,Instructor,"Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative."
192,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Europe?)
193,4,4,Mrs McCormick,We can't afford that.
194,4,4,Instructor,"Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack."
195,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Awww.)
196,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and... you can sing on the way to make money."
197,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
198,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. [exits to the living room]"
199,4,4,Randy Marsh,[follows her out] What? [The boys and the quints watch the news. Sharon and Randy join them]
200,4,4,Anchor Tom and Field Reporters,"...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago."
201,4,4,Man,[reading a statement at gunpoint] Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.
202,4,4,Randy Marsh,Uh-oh.
203,4,4,Stan Marsh,That's your dad?
204,4,4,Quint 2,Maybe.
205,4,4,Quint 1,But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.
206,4,4,Man,How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
207,4,4,Voice,"[hits the man on the head with the gun, k'chunk] Nadia!"
208,4,4,Man,"Nadia, my sweet Barshta"
209,4,4,Voice,[k'chunk] Baltania!
210,4,4,Man,"Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. [the TV is turned off]"
211,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going."
212,4,4,Stan Marsh,"[gets up and runs to his parents] Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??"
213,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? [looks at Randy]"
214,4,4,Randy Marsh,I don't know.
215,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[the girls look at him] You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there."
216,4,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
217,4,4,Sharon Marsh,We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. [she and Randy walk away]
218,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Damn, we might be screwed."
219,4,4,Stan Marsh,No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! [walks off]
220,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[in a log ride with the other seven, passes a lumberjack scene] You see, in America we have... log rides! [Kenny and his mom are at a bus terminal in Denver. A couple passes by and drops some money into the hat. Next, Cartman and friends are at Burger Cook, a fast-food restaurant] Bacon double-cheeseburgers! [Kenny and his mom are now at Coyote Bus Lines (play on Greyhound Bus Lines) in St. Louis at night. A man peeks through a door, another man drops some money into the hat. Next day] Sheep-shearing contests!"
221,4,4,A fan,Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah. [the girls look on expressionless then #2 and #3 look at each other skeptically. Kenny and his mom are now at JFK International Airport in New York. Kenny gets some more money]
222,4,4,Eric Cartman,[showing the others around a three-story shopping mall] And shopping malls! Hooray! [the girls are grinning. Kenny finally lands in Europe and goes out through gate 96]
223,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Woo hoo!)
224,4,4,Romanian Official,"[no beard] Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children."
225,4,4,Janet Reno,"[flanked by two agents in riot gear] Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away."
226,4,4,Mr Vladchick,Okay. [the official smacks him with the back of the hand] Heh!
227,4,4,Romanian Official,Our home is Romania. We love it there.
228,4,4,Mr Vladchick,"Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there."
229,4,4,Romanian Official,"If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return"
230,4,4,Janet Reno,"Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest."
231,4,4,Romanian Official,Protest?
232,4,4,Janet Reno,"Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things."
233,4,4,All three men,Oh.
234,4,4,Janet Reno,"But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible. [the Romanians already look confused]"
235,4,4,Protesters,Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
236,4,4,Stephen Stotch,"Fur is murder! Fur is murder! [notices the stares] Oh, what are we protesting here?"
237,4,4,A Protester,"[with a ""No Romania"" sign] Romania sucks!"
238,4,4,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, let's see [His professional protest sign has multiple pages and he flips through from ""FUR IS MURDER"" to ""FREE KEVORKIAN,"" ""SLEEPING BAGS KILL,"" then ""ROMANIA SUCKS""] Here we go. Romania sucks!"
239,4,4,Protesters,Romania sucks! Romania sucks!
240,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"[looks out through the window. ""Romania sucks! Romania sucks! Romania sucks!""] Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal."
241,4,4,Randy Marsh,"[""Romania sucks!""] That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold."
242,4,4,Lead Agent Collins and other agents,"[backed by 11 other agents and a humvee] Attention, people inside the house! [Randy and Sharon look] You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until... [lowers the bullhorn. An agent comes up and whispers] Oh yeah, that's good. [back on the bullhorn] You have until Easter Sunday to comply."
243,4,4,Protester,Nooo!
244,4,4,Protesters,Boooo!
245,4,4,Lead Agent Collins and other agents,"What?! [the protesters gang up on the agents, beating them with their signs]"
246,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, let's try it again. Hup!"
247,4,4,A Quint,Hup! [she leaps into position to complete the arch. Kyle and Cartman dive through and get up]
248,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Alright!
249,4,4,Randy Marsh,"[enters] Stan, we- [the sight of the undressed boys stops him]"
250,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania."
251,4,4,Stan Marsh,"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America."
252,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??"
253,4,4,Randy Marsh,"I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. [he and Sharon walk away]"
254,4,4,Stan Marsh,Now what do we do?
255,4,4,Reporter,"Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets. [just then, a helicopter flies in and hovers over the house. Janet Reno, dressed in a bunny suit, waits in the open door to be lowered]"
256,4,4,Soldier,"Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan."
257,4,4,Janet Reno,Right.
258,4,4,Soldier,"We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say..."
259,4,4,Janet Reno,"""Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."""
260,4,4,Soldier,Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?
261,4,4,Janet Reno,Ready.
262,4,4,Soldier,Code blue!
263,4,4,Janet Reno,Code blue! [drops down onto the yard]
264,4,4,Music Instructor,"Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School."
265,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
266,4,4,Mrs McCormick,How much is all this gonna cost?
267,4,4,Music Instructor,"Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor."
268,4,4,Assistant,"Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here."
269,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us."
270,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
271,4,4,Janet Reno,"[enters the kitchen through the back door] Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny. [sees nothing but furniture before her. She pulls out a an assault rifle with scope and silencer then moves forth] Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya. [Stan, his parents, and the quints watch TV in the living room, and Janet Reno peeks at them. Terrance and Phillip are heard on the TV. Janet Reno pulls back and flattens herself against the kitchen wall]"
272,4,4,Phillip,"Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. [Reno pulls out an Easter egg and throws it at the girls. It ends up right in front of them]"
273,4,4,Terrance,"Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb."
274,4,4,Quint 2,"Oh, look. An Easter egg."
275,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh, shi- [the Easter egg unleashes its tear gas, and all cough and choke]"
276,4,4,Lead Soldier,"That's it. Let's move, move move move, move! [breaks through the front door and leads the other police officers in.] Give us the kids, now! Now!"
277,4,4,Officer 1,Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor! [more officers stream in as Sharon drops down to the floor and assumes the fetal position]
278,4,4,Officer 2,Find them!
279,4,4,Janet Reno,[bursts through the master bedroom door] This is a bust! Hand over the quints! [police officers are already there looking for them under the bed and in dresser drawers. Reno joins them and heads for the closet. She opens a sliding door and finds Randy holding Stan in his arms and points her weapon at them thus comically recreating the famous image of the US Border Patrol agent pointing his MP5 submachine gun at six year old Elian Gonzalez held by his rescuer Donato Dalrymple] Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!
280,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,[rolls in] What the hell's goin' on?! [all guns point to him]
281,4,4,Officer 3,"Freeze, asshole!"
282,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!"
283,4,4,Officer 3,"Don't push me, man!"
284,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Pull the trigger, you little pussy!"
285,4,4,Officer 3,Gaahhh! [aims away from Grandpa and lets loose with gunfire]
286,4,4,Officer 4,Gun! Gun! [fires into the room. Reno drops down to avoid getting hit. Bullets riddle the wall]
287,4,4,Janet Reno,"Down! Down! [outside, the protesters back away from the house]"
288,4,4,Protester,Riot! Riot! [protesters now move forward against a wall of police]
289,4,4,Officer 5,"Pepper spray! Pepper spray! [the police harden their line, pull out their cans and spray the protesters, who drop down immediately coughing. The house blows up. When the smoke clears, Reno and two officers are seen carrying the quints away. They reach a black van and toss the girls inside.]"
290,4,4,Officer 6,"Go ahead! In the van! [Reno goes in, followed by the other officers. One of them barks an order to the driver, and the van leaves the scene.]"
291,4,4,Stan Marsh,"[standing in front of the still burning ruins of his house] Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!"
292,4,4,Music Instructor,"Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him."
293,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Good job, Kenny."
294,4,4,Music Instructor,"Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?"
295,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"[She kneels down and places her hand on Kenny's head] Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind."
296,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Sure!)
297,4,4,Music Instructor,Alright!
298,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!"
299,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[arrives with Kyle] Dude, what the hell happened?"
300,4,4,Stan Marsh,The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
301,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!"
302,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! Well, not this time!"
303,4,4,Eric Cartman,Huh?
304,4,4,Stan Marsh,"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side! [addresses the mob] Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!"
305,4,4,Protester 1,Hmm.
306,4,4,Protester 2,Yeaahh.
307,4,4,Protester 3,I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30.
308,4,4,Protester 4,"Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?"
309,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime."
310,4,4,Protester 5,Alright! [Fist pumps]
311,4,4,Protester 6,Yeah!
312,4,4,Protester 7,Down with Japan! [the mob moves away]
313,4,4,Janet Reno,"Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy. [The girls are shown with their grinning father. Two of them sit on his laps, the other three stand in front]"
314,4,4,Photographer,"Come on, girls. Smile. [the girls look downcast] We want you to look happy. Smile. [works a sock puppet on his left hand] Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's so silly. ""I'm so silly."" [the girls still have their eyes cast down]"
315,4,4,Stuart and Mrs. McCormick,"Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and- [the butt of a rifle strikes the side of his head] Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much. [looks to his right] Man."
316,4,4,Stan Marsh,Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
317,4,4,Soldier,"[Holds out hand to stop their progress] You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father."
318,4,4,Stan Marsh,"[whistles a signal] Come on, angry mob! [the mob appears behind him. All of them move forward and overrun the checkpoint. A lagging protester runs over a fallen soldier]"
319,4,4,Soldier,Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
320,4,4,Romanian Official,"[the bearded one] Alright, it is time for us to return to Romania."
321,4,4,Janet Reno,[hears something] What is that?
322,4,4,Officer 7,[at a window] It's the protesters. They're back.
323,4,4,Janet Reno,God-damnit! [Puts back on her Easter Bunny 'helmet'] We'll take care of them. Come on!  [leaves the office]
324,4,4,Officer 8,Let's move. Move!
325,4,4,Officer 7,"Come on, come on, come on."
326,4,4,Officer 9,"Come oonn, come oonn. [they follow Reno out, leaving the quints alone in front of a poster that reads ""Join the Army...  It's KILLER!!!"". The officers engage the protesters on a runway]"
327,4,4,Officer 1,This is government property!
328,4,4,Protester,Let the quints stay! [Reno and Sharon head for each other]
329,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"You ruined my house! [lays out Reno using a baseball bat to the Bunny helmet. The quints look out the window, then turn around. Quint 2 hops off the bench and walks to the office phone]"
330,4,4,Quint 1,"What are you doing, Nadia?"
331,4,4,Nadia,I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing. The other girls look at each other.]
332,4,4,Eric Cartman,Take that! [kicks an officer on the shin]
333,4,4,Quint 3,[heads towards the battlefield and addresses everyone] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! [the other four quints are with her. Weapons and signs are lowered]
334,4,4,Quint 1,All of you are acting like idiots!
335,4,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
336,4,4,Quint 1,None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves!
337,4,4,Quint 2,"Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago [he removes his hat and holds it tight], and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!"
338,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you suck, dude!"
339,4,4,Quint 3,"And you Romanian leaders [both of them are there], you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid!"
340,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!"
341,4,4,Quint 3,And you protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life!
342,4,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
343,4,4,Quint 3,And you boys are the worst of all!
344,4,4,Stan Marsh,Huh?
345,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
346,4,4,Eric Cartman,Huh?
347,4,4,Quint 3,"You know nothing about Romania, and yet you assume America is so much better! Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America, but it is our home! We are Romanian! All you care about is your own stupid circus! [at this point, a limousine pulls up behind them. It's from the Oprah show. The driver opens the back door and the girls head for the back seat]"
348,4,4,Janet Reno,"[has a protester in a headlock] Where are you going, girls?"
349,4,4,Quint 1,"The only place we can go. We're going on Oprah and then a book tour. [turns and climbs in, followed by three others]"
350,4,4,Quint 5,Yes. You can all kiss our little white Romanian asses! [wiggles her ass at the crowd and climbs in. The limo leaves and everyone is left in a state of shock.]
351,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways."
352,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, screw them!"
353,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
354,4,4,Stan Marsh,Whatever happened to Kenny?
355,4,4,Romanian Protesters,Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! [a van pulls up and police officers all the way from the U.S. pour out]
356,4,4,Officer 1,"[sternly] Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!"
357,4,4,Romanian Protesters,Boooo!
358,4,4,Officer 2,"Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's go. Move move move move! [bursts through the front door. Officers pour in and look all over the place for Kenny. They enter the master bedroom, and look under the bed and in dresser drawers. One of them head for the closet and opens the sliding door and again the Elian Gonzalez scene is recreated with Kenny and his mother facing the police]"
359,4,4,Officer 3,"[seeing Mrs. McCormick holding Kenny] Hand over the boy, now!"
360,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Okay, okay!"
361,4,4,Officer 3,"I mean it, lady, you've got about-! [his assault rifle goes off, riddling Kenny with bullets. His mom is distraught and drops Kenny] Whoops."
