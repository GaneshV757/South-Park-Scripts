0,4,2,Butters Stotch,Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
1,4,2,Sledders,[three teams of four boys apiece] Ready!
2,4,2,Butters Stotch,"On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! [the teams head down the small hill, and Cartman's team finishes first]"
3,4,2,Stan Marsh,We win again! [all get off their sleds]
4,4,2,Token Black,That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
5,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!"
6,4,2,Lizzy,"We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!"
7,4,2,Stan Marsh,Sleds are for guys.
8,4,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
9,4,2,Lizzy,"These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!"
10,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else."
11,4,2,The rest of the boys,Yeah!
12,4,2,Lizzy,"I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!"
13,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh yeah?!
14,4,2,The Girls,Yeah!
15,4,2,Eric Cartman,We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
16,4,2,Lizzy,"How about a race down a real hill, then?!"
17,4,2,The Girls,Yeah!
18,4,2,Stan Marsh,You got it!
19,4,2,The rest of the boys,Yeah!
20,4,2,A few others,Yeah!
21,4,2,Lizzy,Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
22,4,2,Stan Marsh,Noo problem!
23,4,2,Lizzy,Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
24,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
25,4,2,Lizzy,"See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!"
26,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, boy! We'll show them!"
27,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!"
28,4,2,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are."
29,4,2,Token Black,"Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!"
30,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time [walks to a rock and picks it up] I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! [Kyle draws near to Token]"
31,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Fatass.
32,4,2,Eric Cartman,There! [chucks the rock and it knocks Token down]
33,4,2,Token Black,Oh! [falls face first into the snow. Kyle is stunned that Cartman followed through]
34,4,2,Eric Cartman,[sees what he's done] Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
35,4,2,Mr Mackey,"And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?"
36,4,2,Liane Cartman,"Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?"
37,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Mom."
38,4,2,Liane Cartman,"Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!"
39,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Token."
40,4,2,Mr Mackey,"Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric."
41,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? [drops from his chair] The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. [turns and heads for the door] See ya later."
42,4,2,Mr Mackey,"[raises his index finger] Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!"
43,4,2,Eric Cartman,No way!
44,4,2,Mr Mackey,"Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- [the door opens and two suits enter]"
45,4,2,Man 1,Counselor Mackey?
46,4,2,Mr Mackey,Yes?
47,4,2,Man 1,I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with [with gravity] the FBI.
48,4,2,Agent Keen,We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.
49,4,2,Mr Mackey,"Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention."
50,4,2,Agent Sharp,"I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered [close-up] a hate crime."
51,4,2,Eric Cartman,...What the hell is a hate crime?
52,4,2,Mr Mackey,"Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-"
53,4,2,Agent Keen,"New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense."
54,4,2,Eric Cartman,What? A federal offense?
55,4,2,Mr Mackey,Oh no.
56,4,2,Eric Cartman,Oh no??
57,4,2,Agent Keen,"We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol. [grabs a hold of Cartman] Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in a federal court of law. [the two agents walk out with Cartman]"
58,4,2,Liane Cartman,Oh my goodness.
59,4,2,Announcer,"The hate crime trial of the century is underway [Cartman is shown] on Court TV tracks U van. [Token is shown]. Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith."
60,4,2,"Leslie Smith, Trial TV host","What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom [the courthouse is shown] as the defendant takes the stand."
61,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of ""Token?"""
62,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Uh, yes?"
63,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,Who is Token?
64,4,2,Eric Cartman,He's a black kid that goes to my school?
65,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,Black! [gets animated] Did you say black?! You called him black?!
66,4,2,Eric Cartman,He is black.
67,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"O! He said it again! [the audience gasps] He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!"
68,4,2,Eric Cartman,I did?
69,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
70,4,2,Eric Cartman,No! I hate hippies!
71,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,What?!
72,4,2,Eric Cartman,"I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!"
73,4,2,Liane Cartman,"[behind the defense area] Oo, poopiekins?"
74,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This ""monster"" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!"
75,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[off camera] Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!"
76,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,[faces the audience and judge] The prosecution rests.
77,4,2,Lizzy,"[walks in with Bebe, stops next to Stan and Kyle] Don't forget: we still have a sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters. [turns around and walks away]"
78,4,2,Stan Marsh,We know!
79,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,We know!
80,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice."
81,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one."
82,4,2,Eric Cartman,No!
83,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are! [Cartman stares blankly back at the Judge, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Court is adjourned! [gavels one last time.]"
84,4,2,The Girls,"[Bebe, Lizzy, and Red jump for joy.] Woohoo! Hooray!"
85,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall."
86,4,2,Black Bailiff,"Yes, sir. [they turn to face Cartman]"
87,4,2,White Bailiff,"Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go? [Cartman has disappeared, leaving a fallen chair behind]"
88,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[jumping excitedly] Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!"
89,4,2,Kenny McCormick,(What the fuck for?!)
90,4,2,Eric Cartman,They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
91,4,2,Kenny McCormick,(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
92,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[slaps Kenny] Calm down, Kenny!"
93,4,2,Kenny McCormick,(Hey!)
94,4,2,Eric Cartman,Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
95,4,2,Kenny McCormick,(Yes)
96,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, come on! I don't have much time! [heads for the garage. Outside, the garage door opens and a tiny truck creaks out with Kenny at the wheel and Cartman in the back seat]"
97,4,2,Anchor Tom,A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?
98,4,2,Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins,"[""NEWS 4 LIVE!""] Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him [in a single line, creeping] but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway. [Kenny takes a transition road off to his right] Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about."
99,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!"
100,4,2,Kenny McCormick,[looks back] (Why don'tcha keep your head down?!) [Cartman ducks]
101,4,2,Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins,"Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading. [they have also enlisted the fire department's help] This could be the final stand-off."
102,4,2,Policeman 1,"[holds his hand up for a halt] Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up. [the Bronco keeps going] Just bring it to a stop and come on out. [the Bronco keeps going] Jeezus, he's gonna ram it! [the officers dive for cover and Kenny pushes into the two cars blocking his way. Slowly, tons of steel give way before the puny Bronco, and Kenny and Cartman break through the blockade. The Bronco leaves and the officers get up.] Crazy son of a bitch."
103,4,2,Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins,"Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended. [eight cars are shown in four rows of two following the little Go-Go Action Bronco.]"
104,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are they doing?
105,4,2,Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins,The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
106,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?"
107,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. [the camera zooms out to show two lines of police cars following closely behind Kenny and Cartman. At least 22 cars are shown]"
108,4,2,Eric Cartman,"We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico! [the little Bronco crawls to a dead stop.] Oh, God dammit! [the police cars rush in and the first one bumps the Bronco down the road. The others run into the first one and pile on. A few cars fly over and crash]"
109,4,2,Stan Marsh,[answers] Hello?
110,4,2,Lizzy,"Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!"
111,4,2,Stan Marsh,Son of a bitch!
112,4,2,Driver,"Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall."
113,4,2,Prison Guards and Warden,"Prisoner 24601, arriving. [Cartman enters holding some bedding] Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500. [leads him in] Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband. [they pass through a security door into the mess hall] At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper! [the other kids look up and gasp]"
114,4,2,Eric Cartman,Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
115,4,2,Romper Stomper,"[steps into the aisle] I am! [His feet are shown with yellow pails underneath them. Cartman turns, and a menacing kid with a teardrop tattoo under the left eye looks back at him] And I don't want no new cellmate!"
116,4,2,Prison Guards and Warden,"[Cartman hides behind him] You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!"
117,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Oh, I will! [steps forward on his pails] You bet your ass I will."
118,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday."
119,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. [The others look around at each other]"
120,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?"
121,4,2,Butters Stotch,"...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid."
122,4,2,Clyde Donovan,Huh?
123,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde."
124,4,2,Clyde Donovan,I'm not fat.
125,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid."
126,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!"
127,4,2,Clyde Donovan,"[sits on the back end of the sled] Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned."
128,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! [he, Kyle, and Kenny push off and then hop on as the sled picks up speed. The rest of the kids cheer them on]"
129,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[as the sled stops] Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move."
130,4,2,Lizzy,"[her team's sled passes the boys by] See you Saturday, poo sniffers!"
131,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[looks back at Clyde] Nice going, fat boy!"
132,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!"
133,4,2,Inmates,Yeah!
134,4,2,Eric Cartman,Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
135,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!"
136,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?"
137,4,2,Romper Stomper,[after some thought] ...Neither do we
138,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[softly] Oh, thank you, Jesus. [normally] So we're friends now?"
139,4,2,Romper Stomper,"No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in ""friends."""
140,4,2,Inmates,Yeah!
141,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck."
142,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here."
143,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks [points to them], but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!"
144,4,2,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, that's a wonderful idea."
145,4,2,Clyde Donovan,So I don't get to be on the team now?
146,4,2,All the boys,"Shut up, fatass!"
147,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! [Clyde glares back]"
148,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's get it a try. [he and Kyle get on, and Kenny starts the sled and gets on,]"
149,4,2,Kenny McCormick,Woopee!
150,4,2,Stan Marsh,Woopee!
151,4,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah-
152,4,2,Stan Marsh,Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]
153,4,2,Kenny McCormick,Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]
154,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]
155,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Dude, bail! Bail! [they jump off, leaving Kenny with the brick rider. They end up face down]"
156,4,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Huh? Uh.) [the sled hits a rock, tossing him through the air] (AAAAAA!) [slams into a tree and sticks] (Ufff!) [the brick rider slams into him, killing him] (Ugh!)"
157,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[looks up] Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny."
158,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,We killed Kenny?
159,4,2,Stan Marsh,We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. [they walk up to the tree and stand in front of the puddle of blood]
160,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?"
161,4,2,Stan Marsh,Nothing else is gonna work. [the rest of the boys converge on the tree] We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
162,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!"
163,4,2,Pip Pirrup,This is a sad day for men everywhere.
164,4,2,Stan Marsh,"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted."
165,4,2,All the boys,Yeup.
166,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
167,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was."
168,4,2,Lizzy,"[arrives and steps off the sled] Woohoo. Great time, girls. [notices Kenny flattened against the tree] Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers! [walks away with her sled and the three other girls]"
169,4,2,Stan Marsh,That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
170,4,2,Some boys,Oh?
171,4,2,Other boys,[simultaneous] Huh?
172,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,How?
173,4,2,Stan Marsh,I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
174,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Sweet! Let's go!
175,4,2,The group,Hooray! Alright! Here we go!
176,4,2,Mother 1,And have you been brushing your teeth?
177,4,2,Boy 1,"Yes, Mommy."
178,4,2,Mother 1,And not dropping your soap?
179,4,2,Boy 1,"Yes, Mommy."
180,4,2,Boy 2,"Hi, Mom."
181,4,2,Mother 2,"Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded."
182,4,2,Boy 2,"Grounded? On, no! Um, wait... [Cartman has no visitors yet]"
183,4,2,Guard,"[leads Kyle and Stan to Cartman] Here you go, boys. Keep it short."
184,4,2,Eric Cartman,Hey you guys.
185,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[he and Stan take their seats] Hey, fatass. How's prison?"
186,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?"
187,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!"
188,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. [lowers his voice] So we made you this cake. [lifts it onto the counter, and it reads, ""Get Out Soon, Cartman""] There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it."
189,4,2,Eric Cartman,A what?
190,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] An ailnay ilefay.
191,4,2,Eric Cartman,Wwhat's that?
192,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!"
193,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you stupid umbassday!"
194,4,2,Eric Cartman,"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here"
195,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"They on'tday?! [takes the cake down] Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!"
196,4,2,Stan Marsh,...Yeah.
197,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[a guard walks past him] Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?"
198,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-"
199,4,2,Eric Cartman,Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
200,4,2,Stan Marsh,Sshh! [the guard looks over]
201,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, [hushed] then I need those cigarettes."
202,4,2,Stan Marsh,How are we supposed to give them to you?
203,4,2,Eric Cartman,Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
204,4,2,Stan Marsh,But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
205,4,2,Eric Cartman,"I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. [Stan and Kyle look at him and bust out laughing] Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!"
206,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, here. [pulls some out and slips them through the holes one by one. The guard checks his watch and Cartman packs his ass]"
207,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, okay... here... l'see..."
208,4,2,Stan Marsh,Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
209,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
210,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. [leaves the visiting area]"
211,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. [he and Stan laugh]
212,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[at the door] Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. [the guard opens the door and Cartman walks in]"
213,4,2,Stan Marsh,That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. [pulls it out]
214,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,So now what do we do?
215,4,2,Stan Marsh,"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!"
216,4,2,Romper Stomper,"[reading a book, looks up] Well, did you get the cigarettes?"
217,4,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
218,4,2,Romper Stomper,Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. [Cartman does as told and starts groaning]
219,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. [groans some more until a plop is heard] One. [groans and screams until a second plop is heard] Heh, two. [more groans] Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh [plop] yeahhh. Hoh. Phew. [flushes the toilet and Romper looks up horrified] Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! [walks back to Romper crestfallen]"
220,4,2,Romper Stomper,You flushed them?!
221,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here."
222,4,2,Romper Stomper,"No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me."
223,4,2,Eric Cartman,Son of a bitch!
224,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away."
225,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity."
226,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
227,4,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah. [they walk up to the front door of a nice house. Kyle rings the bell]
228,4,2,Linda Black,[answering] Hello?
229,4,2,Stan Marsh,Hi. Can Token come out and play?
230,4,2,Linda Black,"Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like. [the boys enter]"
231,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Killer.
232,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[sees Token] Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?"
233,4,2,Token Black,No.
234,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well then, [Token begins to move away. Kyle holds his shoulder, but moves with him. Stan follows] you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!"
235,4,2,Token Black,Yeah.
236,4,2,Steve Black,"I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys."
237,4,2,Stan Marsh,It's not?
238,4,2,Steve Black,"No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor."
239,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit! [remembers where he is] Oh, sorry."
240,4,2,Steve Black,"No, I'd, actually agree with you."
241,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
242,4,2,Steve Black,"Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind."
243,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?"
244,4,2,Steve Black,"Oh, he wouldn't listen to me."
245,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Why not?
246,4,2,Steve Black,Because I'm black.
247,4,2,Stan Marsh,Oh.
248,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh.
249,4,2,Steve Black,"Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws. [leads them away]"
250,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[moans and tries until a small splash is heard] Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. [walks in with a box and tosses it on the ground] Here you go, God-damnit!"
251,4,2,Romper Stomper,"[tosses his book away and stands up] Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. [picks it up] Ew, it smells, man."
252,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!"
253,4,2,Romper Stomper,"You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!"
254,4,2,Eric Cartman,But you said-
255,4,2,Romper Stomper,I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
256,4,2,Eric Cartman,I thought that-
257,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house. [walks to the cell door] Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw [Cartman, forsaken, begins to cry] Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess. [turns to Cartman] Hey. Uh, what are you doing? [Cartman cries some more] You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!"
258,4,2,Eric Cartman,I want my Mo-omm [cries some more and rubs his eyes]
259,4,2,Romper Stomper,Dude. [walks up to Cartman]
260,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Mommy, I want my Mommy! [continues crying]"
261,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here."
262,4,2,Eric Cartman,You will?
263,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland."
264,4,2,Colorado Governor's Aide,"Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?"
265,4,2,Colorado Governor,"Naw, not another committee. Send them in. [Stan, Kyle, and Token enter. Kyle carries a boombox and Token an easel with their presentation on it. They set up] This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?"
266,4,2,Token Black,Yeah.
267,4,2,Colorado Governor,"Well, boys, what can I do for you?"
268,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Okay, go ahead and start."
269,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't start, you start."
270,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uhyeah. [walks to the easel and clears his throat] Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."" [shows the title page. Kyle presses the play button for some ambiance] Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws."
271,4,2,Token Black,"[flips a page to depict a stabbing in progress] If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime."
272,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"And we think that that is [flips the page to reveal a copy of the title page] a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?"
273,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[flips the page to reveal a person tagging City Hall] If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?"
274,4,2,Token Black,[flips the page to reveal a man being hit deliberately by a car] And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
275,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark] Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same."
276,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[shows a rainbow of people holding hands] But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes [Stan flips the page to reveal their hate crime proposal]. For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we [flips the page to show them winning a sledding race] will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday."
277,4,2,Stan Marsh,That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
278,4,2,Token Black,"[flips the page to reveal another copy of the title page] ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."" [Kyle turns the tape player off]"
279,4,2,Colorado Governor,Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
280,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us! [Cartman runs ahead, Romper trips on a rock] Mph. Oowww!"
281,4,2,Eric Cartman,[turns around] What's the matter?
282,4,2,Romper Stomper,[looks up] It's my leg! I think it's broken. [looks back] You go on ahead without me.
283,4,2,Eric Cartman,Uhokay. [turns and runs]
284,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Hey. [Cartman stops and turns] You're supposed to say, ""I'm not going without you,"" or something."
285,4,2,Eric Cartman,Oh. Really?
286,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends."
287,4,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
288,4,2,Romper Stomper,I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. [offers his pails]
289,4,2,Eric Cartman,Okay. [retrieves them]
290,4,2,Romper Stomper,"No! You're supposed to say, ""I can't take these,"" or something, dumbass!"
291,4,2,Eric Cartman,Oh. I can't take these. [offers them back]
292,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Take them. They'll bring you luck. [looks back again] Now go on. Get out of here. [Cartman turns, walks some, and returns]"
293,4,2,Eric Cartman,Romper?
294,4,2,Romper Stomper,Yeah?
295,4,2,Eric Cartman,"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me."
296,4,2,Guard,"[shows up with other guards] Alright, freeze! [Cartman steps to Romper's side]"
297,4,2,Eric Cartman,"You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!"
298,4,2,Guard,But you've been pardoned by the governor! [shows the document]
299,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[takes it] O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. [walks away]"
300,4,2,Lizzy,"[at the front of the girls' sled] Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!"
301,4,2,Stan Marsh,Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
302,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
303,4,2,Lizzy,"Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!"
304,4,2,Bebe Stevens,"Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!"
305,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him."
306,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, where's Clyde."
307,4,2,Clyde Donovan,[steps up] Right here.
308,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!"
309,4,2,Clyde Donovan,"For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! [realizes he's responded as Cartman would, and covers his mouth with both hands]"
310,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"On the sled, fatass!"
311,4,2,Lizzy,"Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!"
312,4,2,Other girls,Yeah!
313,4,2,Butters Stotch,"[steps into place with the starting flags] Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-"
314,4,2,Eric Cartman,[Butters looks up] You guys! [runs over a hill into view and races towards the group]
315,4,2,Stan Marsh,It's Cartman!
316,4,2,Boy Sledders,Hooray!
317,4,2,Eric Cartman,"That's right! I'm back! [Clyde walks over and hugs him, and he is surprised]"
318,4,2,Clyde Donovan,"Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back! [relief creeps in] Thank you so much. Thank you."
319,4,2,Eric Cartman,What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
320,4,2,Lizzy,This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
321,4,2,Stan Marsh,All right! Let's do this!
322,4,2,Butters Stotch,Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
323,4,2,Eric Cartman,I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
324,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh-get set. Go! [lowers the flags, and the girls shove off]"
325,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside."
326,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, fatass!"
327,4,2,Eric Cartman,"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-"
328,4,2,Token Black,"Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]"
329,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]"
330,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]"
331,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! [the camera looks at the slope. The girls come down first, then the boys]"
332,4,2,Lizzy,"We've got' em, girls!"
333,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
334,4,2,Kids at Finish Line,Go! You can do it! Come on!
335,4,2,Stan Marsh,"We're not gonna make it! [Cartman thinks, then he remembers.]"
336,4,2,Eric Cartman,Hey. [pulls out the pails and tosses them at the girls' sled]
337,4,2,Lizzy,"G'aaaaah! [the pails gum up the reins. The girls' sled veers off the run and over a cliff. The weightlessness causes the girls and sled to separate, and all fall scattered on the ground below. A brown bear comes up]"
338,4,2,Bear,Rowr. {carries Lizzy away]
339,4,2,Boy Sledders,[crossing the finish line] Hooray!
340,4,2,Stan Marsh,We did it!
341,4,2,Girls,"Awww. [walk away disappointed, leaving only one blonde carrying a sign: GIRLS RULE]"
342,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,We won! We won!
343,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!"
344,4,2,Boys,Hooray!
345,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"It's good to have you back, Cartman."
346,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again."
347,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again."
348,4,2,Pip Pirrup,"Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass! [no one does. Cartman picks up a rock and throws it at him] Oh-ff. [falls on his face. The rock lands next to Cartman]"
349,4,2,Eric Cartman,Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
350,4,2,Stan Marsh,Naah.
351,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Naah.
352,4,2,Butters Stotch,Naah.
353,4,2,Token Black,Naah.
354,4,2,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
355,4,2,Guard,Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up! [Romper gets up] You got a visitor! [rolls the door aside and Cartman enters]
356,4,2,Romper Stomper,Eric!
357,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey, Romper Stomper."
358,4,2,Romper Stomper,Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
359,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too."
360,4,2,Romper Stomper,"You did? [Cartman goes to the door to make sure the guards are gone, then returns to Stomper]"
361,4,2,Eric Cartman,You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
362,4,2,Romper Stomper,Yeah. [Cartman walks off to the toilet]
363,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[begins grunting. A few moments later, and a grin breaks out on Stomper's face. A big splash follows] Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh."
364,4,2,Romper Stomper,Whoa! [end credits roll]
365,4,2,Eric Cartman,Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. [splash. Romper is stunned] Ogh! Wait-
366,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Oh, yeah!"
367,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[grunts some more] Uh, what else? [splash] Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! [grunts some more, then, splash]"
368,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Oh, the monorail!"
