0,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card! [tosses it in front of him] You can deny it, or cover it up."
1,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't understand this game at all."
2,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[Front of board game box is seen with 'Kurtis' spelled incorrectly with a 'C'] It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up."
3,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Um, deny it?"
4,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. [presses an electronic Bill Kurtis head]"
5,4,5,Electronic Head,"[trembles from side to side] Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis."
6,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card. [tosses it in front of him] You lose a turn."
7,4,5,Stan Marsh,Sweet.
8,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! [tosses the card in front of him]"
9,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
10,4,5,Eric Cartman,I just gave you AIDS.
11,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,AIDS?! [looks confused]
12,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS."
13,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns [Kyle turns angry] and 800 points. [camera pans back, and Kenny's parents appear at the door with arms around each other]"
14,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?"
15,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(No.)
16,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"[tickling his wife] We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. [they walk off giggling]"
17,4,5,Eric Cartman,"God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars."
18,4,5,Stan Marsh,"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!"
19,4,5,Eric Cartman,"...You see. [stands] Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!"
20,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
21,4,5,Eric Cartman,"I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here [hovers his right hand at eye level], and all my friends are down here [hovers it at stomach level]."
22,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!"
23,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Nononono! Me h'myah [hand at eye level], you guys myah! [hand at chest level] — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. [hand at foot level. Then he straightens up] SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. [turns around, walks out, and towards the front door.]"
24,4,5,Electronic Head,I'm Bill Kurtis.
25,4,5,Eric Cartman,"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. [looks at Clyde Frog for a few seconds, then] Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog! [walks over to the chair and hops on] I can meet new friends on the Internet! [clicks the mouse and presses a few keys, then the computer chimes. A list of chat rooms comes up] Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys"" [moves the cursor to the title and clicks on it] That's perfect. [starts typing] Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li- [replies start cascading over his message] Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316. [click on Tony's reply and starts typing] Hi Tony. [clicks and reads the reply] ""So what are you into?"" [replies] Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face. [clicks and reads the reply] ""Kewl. Wanna get together? [softer] Smiley-face?"" [replies] Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face. [clicks and reads the reply] ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning."" [replies] Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face. [clicks, then brightly] You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!"
26,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Hi, are you Tony? [the man looks unusually friendly]"
27,4,5,Tony,Yeah. You're -Eric?
28,4,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah! [gets into the booth and sits next to Tony]
29,4,5,Tony,"[meekly, hands a bag to Cartman] I brought you some candy."
30,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[takes the bag] Wow, cool!"
31,4,5,Tony,[hands him two books] And some books on Kama Sutra.
32,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends [Tony places his hand on Cartman's back and starts rubbing with an open smile]; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now."
33,4,5,Tony,Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
34,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. [two agents burst through the main door and head for Tony and Cartman]"
35,4,5,Agent,"Hold it right there, scumbag!"
36,4,5,Tony,[Quickly removes hands from Cartman] Huh?
37,4,5,Eric Cartman,Huh?
38,4,5,Agent,[pulls out some handcuffs] We monitored your little online chat. [cuffs Tony] Now you're coming with us! [hauls him away]
39,4,5,Tony,[meekly] No! [the two agents whisk him outside]
40,4,5,Eric Cartman,[concerned] What the hell just happened?
41,4,5,Mom,"You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby."
42,4,5,Dad,"Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby."
43,4,5,Mom,"Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers!"
44,4,5,Dad,You have to share your room with the baby!
45,4,5,Mom,The baby.
46,4,5,Dad,The baby!
47,4,5,Mom,The baby!!
48,4,5,Kenny McCormick,[wakes and sits up] (HAAAAAAAAGH!) [looks around]
49,4,5,Mrs McCormick,[giggles] Stop it!
50,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again."
51,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, alright. [they get up and move when Kenny arrives with glove and baseball]"
52,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Dad, I wanna play catch.)"
53,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son."
54,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(But I wanna play now!)
55,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards."
56,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Aw, alright."
57,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it! [tosses it high, but straight for Kenny's glove. Kenny catches it] Good job. Now throw me one. [Kenny takes the ball out of the glove, looks at it in anger, and shoots it straight for his father's groin. Stuart doubles over in pain and covers his crotch] Ohp! Guhhogh! [groaning, he ends up on his side, then throws up]"
58,4,5,Mrs McCormick,[opens the door and rushes out] What happened?!
59,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Aw, he smacked me in the balls! [groans some more. Kenny tosses the glove to his mother]"
60,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"[goes inside] (Woohoo!) [Stuart groans some more, then vomits]"
61,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, we'll try this again. [starts typing as BigBoned] Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to- [More quickly than before, his screen fills with cascading replies. He picks one] Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy. [starts typing] Hello, HungDaddy. [reads the reply] ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf. [Says out loud:] Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. [Types and says:] Midgets piss me off. Frowny face. [clicks and moves on] Lemme see, how about this one?"
62,4,5,Eric Cartman,[draws close to the man] Mister Hammerhead?
63,4,5,Mr Hammerhead,[turns around and is instantly recognizable] Hi there.
64,4,5,Eric Cartman,Mr. Garrison??
65,4,5,Mr Garrison,[startled] Haah! Eric!
66,4,5,Eric Cartman,You wanna be my friend?
67,4,5,Mr Garrison,"Oh, crap!"
68,4,5,Eric Cartman,"That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?"
69,4,5,Mr Garrison,"Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing! [four agents appear and head for him]"
70,4,5,Agent,"Alright, scumbag, we got you!"
71,4,5,Mr Garrison,"[voice quivering] Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me."
72,4,5,Agent,"Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chat—now, you're coming with us! [the four agents, two on either side of Garrison, take him away]"
73,4,5,Mr Garrison,No-o!
74,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!"
75,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines. [elderly people are seen hooked up to them] Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out."
76,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, man, that's terrible."
77,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this. [plants his lips wide on the glass and blows out] Waaaaah! [as the seal takes hold, his cheeks puff up and the inside of his his mouth shows clearly — it is a blow face. Stan smiles]"
78,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Haha, he-yeah ha. [makes his own blow face] Haaaaah."
79,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,[makes the blow face and wags his tongue at the patients] Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
80,4,5,Stan Marsh,[does the same] Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
81,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks up] Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!"
82,4,5,Stan Marsh,[looks and then faces him. Kyle follows] We're making faces at sick people.
83,4,5,Eric Cartman,"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! [Stan and Kyle are confused and look at each other]"
84,4,5,Stan Marsh,We don't know.
85,4,5,Eric Cartman,"I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!"
86,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt."
87,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!"
88,4,5,Stan Marsh,"You're not more mature than us, Cartman!"
89,4,5,Eric Cartman,YES I AM!! [Stan and Kyle back up a bit. Cartman turns and walks away]
90,4,5,Mr Garrison,"I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady."
91,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants."
92,4,5,Mr Garrison,O-ogh! [returns to the bed and sits]
93,4,5,Tony,Do you like having your back rubbed?
94,4,5,Mr Garrison,"Eat me, pervert!"
95,4,5,Tony,Okay. [some commotion is heard outside. A group of men is seen approaching and the front door opens. The men walk in and approach the desk]
96,4,5,Man,We demand you release these men at once!
97,4,5,Officer Barbrady,Who are you?
98,4,5,Man,"We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?"
99,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters."
100,4,5,Man,"Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!"
101,4,5,Other NAMBLA Men,"[ad lib] Yeah, uh-huh."
102,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"[stands up] Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI."
103,4,5,Man,Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
104,4,5,Other NAMBLA Men,Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
105,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people [the men fall silent], I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!"
106,4,5,Man,All these men wanted was to love a young boy! [pounds the table a few times] There is nothing wrong with love!
107,4,5,Mr Garrison,"I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age. [gasps and shrieks] Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!"
108,4,5,Man,"You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong. [turns and heads for the door] Come on, men! [the others follow him out, chattering]"
109,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"[sits back down and plops his feet up] Wow, they've got activists for everything these days."
110,4,5,Dr Mephesto,"I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese. [the ""cheesemunk""in the box groans] Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- [the doorbell rings] Who could that be? [walks over and opens the door] Why, it's little Eric Cartman."
111,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Dr. Mephesto, I need help."
112,4,5,Dr Mephesto,"Well of course, come in."
113,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[follows Mephesto and Kevin in] You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me."
114,4,5,Dr Mephesto,"[stops and faces him] Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people."
115,4,5,Eric Cartman,Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
116,4,5,Dr Mephesto,"Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA."
117,4,5,Eric Cartman,NAMBLA?
118,4,5,Dr Mephesto,Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
119,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! [turns and walks out]"
120,4,5,Dr Mephesto,Sure!
121,4,5,Man,"[henceforth, NAMBLA leader] Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy."
122,4,5,Members of North American Man-Boy Love Association,Awwww.
123,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws, [pounds on the podium] we want the same!"
124,4,5,Members of North American Man-Boy Love Association,[weakly] Yeah.
125,4,5,Eager Man,Yeh-hehah-hah.
126,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a- [Cartman enters and takes a seat. Men in the back row look on with some awe.] Can we... help you?"
127,4,5,Eric Cartman,Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
128,4,5,NAMBLA leader,You... do?
129,4,5,Eric Cartman,Sure.
130,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"[greatly relieved] Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus."
131,4,5,Eric Cartman,[looks around] ...Sweet.
132,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister."
133,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(No!!) [the camera zooms in on him]
134,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Yup, it's for sure!"
135,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!"
136,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. [the parents walk away]"
137,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny."
138,4,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
139,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) [turns around and walks away in his parents' direction]
140,4,5,Eric Cartman,[rushes up from the other direction] Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
141,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you talking about, fatass?"
142,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! [turns and walks away]"
143,4,5,Pharmacist,"Can I help you, young lady?"
144,4,5,Kenny McCormick,[wearing a blonde wig] (Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)
145,4,5,Pharmacist,"Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there. [points to them. Kenny looks]"
146,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Thanks.) [walks over and looks at them. He sees ""Morning After Abortion Pills,"" ""Baby - B- Gone,"" ""Get it outta me! (has an unknown, real woman's face pictured)"" ""Fetus Flusher"" ""Pregnant No More Super Size."" He takes the ""Pregnant No More"" pills to the counter]"
147,4,5,Pharmacist,"Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents. [Kenny hands him a note that reads: I hereby give my daughter permission to abort her baby -Mother] Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?"
148,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Cash.)
149,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) [a rat climbs onto the sofa headrest; Stuart shoos it away]"
150,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me."
151,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Here.) [presents the mug]
152,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink."
153,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
154,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Well, I can still drink. [grabs the mug and starts chugging away]"
155,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(No! Daddy!) [looks on as Stuart finishes the mug off]
156,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls. [seeing Kenny looking at him] What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of... [his stomach starts to churn, and he holds it] Who-o-oa."
157,4,5,Mrs McCormick,What's the matter?
158,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Uh oh.)
159,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants! [rushes to the bathroom]"
160,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oohhh, God! [farts and craps in pain] Oooh, my balls! [Kenny appears at the door. Stuart turns around and vomits into the toilet. He alternates between crapping and vomiting, farting all the while] Ooh, God [more alternating between pooping and vomiting as Kenny just stares]"
161,4,5,NAMBLA Member,"Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child."
162,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, dude. [poses in his beefcake swim pants for several shots before a curtain that says ""I LOVE NAMBLA""]"
163,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"[arrives with some other members] Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child."
164,4,5,Eric Cartman,Really? Awesome![continues to pose in various ways as camera shutter sounds are heard]
165,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends. [the guys behind him start to drool]"
166,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature, [looks back at the camera and mumbles] excluding Stan and Kyle, of course."
167,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready."
168,4,5,Eric Cartman,KIIICK ASS!
169,4,5,Mrs McCormick,[off-screen] Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. [Kenny hops off as one commercial ends. Another one draws his attention.]
170,4,5,Announcer,"[echo on] Hey, are you feeling down? You need some excitement. And North Park Funland has just opened its newest ride! The John Denver Experience! [the ride is demonstrated] You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT."
171,4,5,Two Guys,"[""ACTUAL TESTIMONIAL""] It was-"
172,4,5,Guy 1,[holds up right thumb] -fun.
173,4,5,Guy 2,[holds up left thumb] -fun.
174,4,5,Announcer,Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!
175,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Mom!) [walks away]
176,4,5,Stuart McCormick,Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
177,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, it's all right. [in a low voice] You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. [the line moves forward. Kenny and his parents find seats in the first row. The ride itself is wrapped in the body of a small plane, with a wing serving as a ramp]"
178,4,5,John Denver Experience Ride Operator,"[speaks into a muffled PA system] Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride here at the John Denver Experience. Have fun."
179,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"What did he say? [the ride swings up smoothly, but at the top it swings into high gear, slamming into the platform during one swing, into a building during another swing, and back and forth this way a few times. Mrs. McCormick is enjoying it quite a bit. The ride ends with a slam into a large pool, where the plane rests upside down] ...John Denver Experience."
180,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!"
181,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom."
182,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick! [heads for the nearest trash can and vomits into it. A woman carrying her baby moves away. He grabs his stomach] Oh, my stuhomach! [pulls down his pants and poops in the trash can] Oh, my nose! [sneezes blood into the trash can] Augh! [vomits, poops, and sneezes, and this goes on for quite a while. Kenny simply slaps his hand to his head and rolls his eyes.]"
183,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor."
184,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,They are?
185,4,5,Eric Cartman,"We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!"
186,4,5,Stan Marsh,[angry] We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
187,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go."
188,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,We don't wanna go!
189,4,5,Eric Cartman,You can't go.
190,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,We don't WANNA go!
191,4,5,Eric Cartman,"No, you CAN'T go. [turns around and walks away] Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out"
192,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature."
193,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too."
194,4,5,Dr Doctor,"You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick. [sees Kenny sneaking a peek] It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life. [Kenny approaches and is covered in amniotic fluid as his mom's water bursts]"
195,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Eeww.)
196,4,5,Dr Doctor,I can see its head!
197,4,5,Ms McCormick,You can?
198,4,5,Dr Doctor,"Push, now. Push hard! [Ms.McCormick holds onto Stuart's hand hard and pushes the baby out. The doctor shields his face] Oh my God. [the nurse screams in horror]"
199,4,5,Ms McCormick,What is it?? [the baby is shown; it is a mutant with long claws and a nasty disposition]
200,4,5,Dr Doctor,"[turns to run] It's ali- [the mutant baby decapitates Dr. Doctor, the nurse, and Kenny]"
201,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh my God, it killed Kenny!"
202,4,5,Ms McCormick,"Bad baby, bad!"
203,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"[sits up awake] (Huh. Huh??) [looks around and realizes he's awake] (That does it!) [jumps off, goes to the bathroom and gets a plunger. Then he leaves the restroom]"
204,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"[lowers the book] Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'? [he lifts the plunger and aims it at her] Uh what are you doing, Kenny? [he fixes his gaze on her] Kenny, what are you going to plunge?"
205,4,5,Kenny McCormick,[rushes at her with the plunger] (AAAARRRRHHH!)
206,4,5,Mrs McCormick,Aaaaaaah! [jumps off the sofa and runs away] AAAAA! [Stuart arrives as Kenny pursues his mom]
207,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Kenny, what the hell are you doing?! [follows them out]"
208,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[sees them] What the hell? [hops off his chair and walks towards them] Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!"
209,4,5,Stan Marsh,"We got invited too, fatass!"
210,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Hunh. [rolls his eyes] Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA."
211,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"[now at the podium, a little giddy] Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us."
212,4,5,NAMBLA Member,"Oh, yeah. [others cheer]"
213,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys."
214,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[graciously, amid some applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [takes a bow] Thank you."
215,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members."
216,4,5,Stan Marsh,This is boring.
217,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [yells] HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?"
218,4,5,Member 1,Ho hohohoho
219,4,5,Member 2,"Woohoohoohoohoo. [others react similarly, lustily]"
220,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"[barely containing his glee] Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... ""get"" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick."
221,4,5,Patrick and Mr. Harris,"Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful [Butters lights up], bright, little boy."
222,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, uh I sure am, I guess."
223,4,5,Patrick and Mr. Harris,And his skin is as soft as fresh linen. [the other men savor the statement]
224,4,5,Stan Marsh,[to Kyle] That seems kind of... weird.
225,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose."
226,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?"
227,4,5,Mr Harris,"[with a stammer] Well, I want to announce that I may have found the dream boy of the decade. He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk. His name is Timmy."
228,4,5,Timmy Burch,"TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?"
229,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance! [the DJ starts the music again, and the boys and their partners take the dance floor. Stan and Kyle stay in their seats, as do Cartman and his partner.]"
230,4,5,Lead Agent,"Alright, I want those perverted bastards all taken in. Got it?"
231,4,5,Agents,Got it!
232,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,"[Kevin at his side] Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South Park representative- [the doors fly open and the FBI agents fill the room]"
233,4,5,Lead Agent,[heading for Mephesto] Hold it right there!
234,4,5,Agent 1,Freeze!
235,4,5,Agent 2,Don't nobody move!
236,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,What's going on? [four rifles and a shotgun are pointed at him]
237,4,5,Lead Agent,"Alright, sickos. Where are the children?! [the NAMBLA members look at each other confused]"
238,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,What children?
239,4,5,Lead Agent,"This... is... NAMBLA, right?"
240,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,Yes.
241,4,5,Lead Agent,The North American Man/Boy Love Association?
242,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,"[startled] What? No! [Points to the banner behind him] We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes. [a shot of the members is shown, and many of them do look like Marlon Brando]"
243,4,5,Blond Agent,"Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA."
244,4,5,Mr Garrison,"Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place. [gets up and walks out]"
245,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
246,4,5,Lead Agent,You know of them?
247,4,5,Blond Member,Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com!
248,4,5,Brunet Member,"Yeah, those perverted bastards!"
249,4,5,Blond Agent,Wow. You guys really do look a lot like Marlon Brando.
250,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,"Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!"
251,4,5,Members of North American Man-Boy Love Association,Yeah! Yeah!
252,4,5,Black Member,And let's kick their asses for stealin' our domain name!
253,4,5,Members of North American Man-Boy Love Association,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
254,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"[Cartman stands next to him] Alright, members, that's enough of that. [the music is stopped] It's time for all of us to retire to our respective rooms, and get to know our new young boys. [NAMBLA members rub their hands react lustily]"
255,4,5,Member 3,All right.
256,4,5,Member 4,Alright.
257,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. Being mature is boring!
258,4,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
259,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm."
260,4,5,The Boys,Aaaaah! [all pour out into the hallway]
261,4,5,Stan Marsh,Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
262,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! [music resumes. All the boys turn and head for the stairs, only to see shadows moving up the wall, and they stop in their tracks]"
263,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! [the boys run into room 1A. Mephesto shows up and leads the other look-alikes onto the hallway]"
264,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,"Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room. [they enter 2E. The FBI then arrives amid much commotion]"
265,4,5,Lead Agent,"Let's get those perverts! [the agents fan out and enter all rooms except 1A and 2E. A waiter heads for the stairs with a tray, but naked NAMBLA members pour out of their rooms and startle him. The tray flies off his hand]"
266,4,5,Waiter,Sacrebleu! [picks up the tray and heads back to the room he left. The NAMBLA members go into 1A]
267,4,5,The Boys,Whoa! [pour out of 1A and head down the hall to 2E. The door there opens and the Marlon Brandos peek out]
268,4,5,The Boys and The Brandos,"Aaah! [the boys run to 1E, the Brandos go back into 2E, and the doors to both are shut]"
269,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"[enters the hallway from the stairs] Kenny, no! Leave me alone [heads into 1C]"
270,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Come here, mom! Let me get it!) [follows her in. The agents pour out of the rooms and switch places, again avoiding 1A and 2E. Stuart arrives and looks around]"
271,4,5,Stuart McCormick,Kenny?? [enters 2C. The waiter again heads for the stairs with the tray]
272,4,5,Waiter,"Zis time, I will not drop zeh food. [makes it to the top of the stairs, but drops the tray when the NAMBLA members exit 1A] Allo!"
273,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?! [the NAMBLA members enter 2A]
274,4,5,Waiter,"[picks up the tray and goes back down the hall, angrily] Sacre bleu! [the door to 2E opens and the Marlon Brandos step out]"
275,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,I think the boys went in here. [the Brandos enter 1E]
276,4,5,The Boys,[all exit 1E] Aaaaaah!
277,4,5,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [all enter 2D. A poodle on a ball exits 1C and enters 2D. The NAMBLA members exit 2A and head for 1C]
278,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys? [the NAMBLA members enter 1C. Kenny's mom and Kenny exit 1C]
279,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, GIVE IT UP!"
280,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Come on!) [both enter 2C. The waiter heads for the stairs again with the tray, but Marlon Brandos and FBI agents pour out of 1E]"
281,4,5,Waiter,[falls backwards] Waaah!
282,4,5,Lead Agent,"Alright, you're under arrest!"
283,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!
284,4,5,Lead Agent,Damnit!
285,4,5,Agent,"Hey, we didn't try that room! [Brandos and agents head for 2A and enter. Two guys in vintage bikes ride across from 2D to 1D]"
286,4,5,Waiter,"[exasperated, gets up with the tray] Sacre bleu. [walks away, having given up on the stairs]"
287,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,[panting] Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
288,4,5,Eric Cartman,They're all over the place.
289,4,5,Timmy Burch,Timmiihhh!
290,4,5,Token Black,[Token joins the group] What are we gonna do?!
291,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out."
292,4,5,The Boys,Yeah.
293,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out."
294,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,How?
295,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team. [the other boys are shocked at the thought] And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. [presents him]"
296,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?"
297,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Now, are you a team player or not?!"
298,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess."
299,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team."""
300,4,5,Butters Stotch,Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
301,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Just go, Butters. We're running out of time."
302,4,5,Butters Stotch,Well uuh-uuh-alright then. [heads for the door. Stan sees him out and Cartman closes the door]
303,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass."
304,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, alright men. Here, here I come. [puts his hands over his eyes and moves across the hall] I'm ready to take one for the team. [enters 1D.]"
305,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"[exits 2D] Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! [enters 1E]"
306,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"[inside 1E] Oh, one of the boys just came in. [the members surround him and being their activity...]"
307,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! [Butters steps out of 1D, listens in at the door to 1E, turns around and walks away.]"
308,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"[voice shaking, approaches] Are you alright, Stuart?"
309,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"[sobbing] Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men—I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! [the NAMBLA members are in cuffs]"
310,4,5,Lead Agent,"[to NAMBLA Leader] We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?"
311,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called ""freedom."" They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look at each other] You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand. [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at the NAMBLA leader]"
312,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. You have sex with children.
313,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away. [shots of the agents, then the Brando look-alikes, then Stan and Kyle, who look at each other, then at the NAMBLA leader]"
314,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[slowly, for emphasis] Dude. You have sex with children."
315,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you."
316,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,Seriously.
317,4,5,Lead Agent,"Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time. [The agents escort the NAMBLA members away. The members groan. The boys gather around Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]"
318,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Cartman?"
319,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, what?"
320,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
321,4,5,The Boys,Yeah!
322,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There."
323,4,5,Stan Marsh,"And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?"
324,4,5,Eric Cartman,"No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. [the paramedics finish putting Stuart into the ambulance and head for the cab]"
325,4,5,Paramedic,"Okay, let's roll. [the siren goes on. The ambulance goes into reverse and crushes Kenny under its rear wheels, then speeds off]"
326,4,5,A Nurse,"[voice-over] Dr. Flores, dial 18-"
327,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo."
328,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Our little angel, yes."
329,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. [a shot of the baby reveals a boy in a little orange parka with the hood tight on his face, like Kenny before him]"
330,4,5,Mrs McCormick,What should we name him?
331,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny."
332,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)"
333,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened."
334,4,5,Mrs McCormick,Fifty-second.
