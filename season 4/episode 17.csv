0,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike."
1,4,17,Ike Broflovski,"[pulls himself onto the seat and looks in] Oooh nooo, poopies."
2,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike. [lifts him off the seat and takes him back to the night stand] Come sit by me. [they sit down and face the toilet bowl, and wait. Nothing happens.]"
3,4,17,Sheila Broflovski,"[at the door with Gerald] It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed."
4,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does."
5,4,17,Sheila Broflovski,"Alright, bubbe. [leaves with Gerald, but returns] Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah."
6,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Happy Chanukah, Mom. [returns his sight to the toilet bowl and waits...]"
7,4,17,Ike Broflovski,"[Waves the flag around] Ayaaa ta. [Kyle is getting drowsy] Weee! Weee... [soon, Ike is asleep on Kyle's shoulder as Kyle drifts into sleep, but checks on the plate once in a while. An ant is now on the toilet seat inching its way to the cookies. Kyle watches drowsily until the ant touches the cookies...]"
8,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Go away!
9,4,17,Stan Marsh,[picks up the phone] A-ah huh.
10,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[barks. Music stops] Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
11,4,17,Stan Marsh,Ho-o-oh.
12,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, good. You're all here."
13,4,17,Stan Marsh,"What is this all about, Kyle?"
14,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
15,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. [turns aside and walks off]"
16,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come."
17,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?"
18,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!"
19,4,17,Eric Cartman,Heh-tchoo!
20,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns and glares at Cartman] Dude, you sneezed on my back!"
21,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!"
22,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look. [before them is a small cottage in a collection basin. They walk to the end of the sewer line] Hello?"
23,4,17,Mr Hankey,Hoowwddyy ho! [behind him is a little cottage all glittered in light]
24,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-"
25,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle."
26,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
27,4,17,Mr Hankey,"I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family. [calls into the house] Honey!"
28,4,17,Eric Cartman,Family?
29,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn."
30,4,17,Autumn,"Howdy-hey kids! [waves in the same way Mr. Hankey does, holds a martini in her left hand] Would you like a drink?"
31,4,17,Mr Hankey,"They're too young to drink, honey."
32,4,17,Autumn,"Hey haa, it's Christmas!"
33,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids! [they come one one by one] This is our son, Cornwallis."
34,4,17,Cornwallis,"[wearing glasses, a scarf and little blue beret] Hoowwdy Ho! [hops aside as another nugget enters]"
35,4,17,Mr Hankey,Our daughter Amber.
36,4,17,Amber,[in pink dress and maroon bow] Hoowwdy Ho! [hops aside as another nugget enters]
37,4,17,Mr Hankey,"And our son, Simon."
38,4,17,Simon,"Eee, hey! Hnhn."
39,4,17,Mr Hankey,[aside] Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
40,4,17,Siimon,Heh What? Dad? Huh?
41,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Nothin', Simon."
42,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
43,4,17,Mr Hankey,It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
44,4,17,Stan Marsh,"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore."
45,4,17,Eric Cartman,My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
46,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer! [the nuggets grin] And if you want, you can help them."
47,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Sure we'll help! [Stan grins]
48,4,17,Eric Cartman,Anything for more presents!
49,4,17,Autumn,"""Hic"" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes?"
50,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?"
51,4,17,Autumn,But it's a Christmas party!
52,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Honey, can we go inside for a second? [they enter the little house and start arguing. The boys look on in shock while the nuggets keep their smiles. Abruptly the arguing stops and the two adult poos step out again] Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!"
53,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until- [a couple walks past] God-damnit! [a man walks past in the other direction] Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! [a woman walks by]"
54,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Nobody's paying any attention. [Amber clears her throat as a foot comes down over Simon, and the foot pulls away]"
55,4,17,Woman,"Ew, I almost stepped in it."
56,4,17,Tele s Owner,"[exits and locks his door] Well, it was a good effort, boys. But I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's buyin' anything an' I can't afford to keep this furnace runnin'! [starts to leave, but notices the nuggets] Oh. And, boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk there. Watch out. [the nuggets look downcast. Red Harris leaves the toy store.]"
57,4,17,Red Harris,"[locks the door] Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love. [starts sobbing, then walks away]"
58,4,17,Stan Marsh,[emotionally] This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
59,4,17,News Anchor,"And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS! [a chart appears] In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity. [the field poll follows]"
60,4,17,Ms Choksondik,"Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh. [the boys sit on Cartman's sofa watching the news] I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke."
61,4,17,Sound Man,"[with a son who waves at the camera] You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?"
62,4,17,Man 2,"Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls."
63,4,17,News Anchor,"Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong."
64,4,17,Assistant,[whispers into the anchor's ear] In South Park.
65,4,17,News Anchor,Oh really?
66,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. [Cartman clicks the remote, and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" pops up. Charlie, Lucy, and Snoopy are on screen]"
67,4,17,Charlie Brown,Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
68,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again."
69,4,17,Stan Marsh,How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
70,4,17,"Charlie Brown
 Lucy
 Linus
 Snoopy","[as other kids dance around him] Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!"
71,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!"
72,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act."
73,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[affecting a Peanuts accent] And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this."
74,4,17,Eric Cartman,My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
75,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it! [drops down from the sofa and walks to the TV] It's so simple!"
76,4,17,Stan Marsh,"What, dude?"
77,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns and faces the other boys] We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! [Charlie and Linus talk onscreen]"
78,4,17,Stan Marsh,We don't know anything about animation.
79,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,How hard can it be? Look at it. [Snoopy and Charlie walk in the woods]
80,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!"
81,4,17,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, right! Awesome!)"
82,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" [onscreen, Snoopy is pummeling a naked Charlie Brown hard across the face with a 2-by-4]"
83,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[worried] Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!"
84,4,17,Aide 2,"Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you."
85,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,Meugh. Send them in.
86,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[as the boys enter]Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
87,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,You do?
88,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
89,4,17,Stan Marsh,"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget."
90,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[falsely enthusiastic] An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!"
91,4,17,The Boys,Awww.
92,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars."
93,4,17,The Boys,Alright!
94,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[to the other three] You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
95,4,17,Mr Hankey,Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase! [now warning] Don't you throw that vase! [the vase is thrown and breaks.]
96,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[now facing the house from the sewer] Ah, Mr. Hankey?"
97,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[exits the front door] Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!"
98,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[excited] We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card."
99,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Oh, that's swell! Kids! [the nuggets come out] Christmas is back on! We've gotta all go get that old drive-in workin' again."
100,4,17,The Nuggets,Okay!
101,4,17,Autumn,"That's not the only thing we gotta get workin' again, [pokes him] if you know what I mean..."
102,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[concerned] Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?"
103,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. [turns and walks away...]"
104,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry! [Cornwallis sniffs at himself]"
105,4,17,Amber,"What's the matter, Cornwallis?"
106,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got."
107,4,17,Butters Stotch,"[behind a desk] Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me."
108,4,17,Stan Marsh,[impatient] Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
109,4,17,Butters Stotch,"Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus. [holds him up and moves him a bit] ""Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff"" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus. [brings him forth] ""Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."" [Santa] ""Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose."" Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. [unfurls a large sheet which contains some mountains and spitting images of the four boys]"
110,4,17,The boys,Whoa!
111,4,17,Eric Cartman,"[points] Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat."
112,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[retorts] That's not me, that's you!"
113,4,17,Eric Cartman,What?!
114,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"They kind of look like us. [the poster is shown again] I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us."
115,4,17,Eric Cartman,"I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! [Butters sets the poster on the desk, face up]"
116,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"God job, Butters."
117,4,17,Butters Stotch,"Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film."
118,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[grabs the poster] No, that's okay. [walks away]"
119,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"See ya! [grabs Santa, Cartman grabs Jesus, and they walk away with Kenny]"
120,4,17,Butters Stotch,"Uh-m, alright, alright then. [the door closes, and a few second later, he reaches into a top drawer and pulls out a Barbie cutout. In falsetto...] ""Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"" [moves the Butters cutout] ""Huh, Butters, ma'am."" [moves the Barbie cutout while in falsetto]  ""Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"" [moves the Butters cutout closer] ""Whoa! Well, uhuh"" [a smile of fantasy flashes across his face] ""Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again."" [guiltily puts the cutout away.]"
121,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in."
122,4,17,Cornwallis,"I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad."
123,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[takes a seat at the table] Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas."
124,4,17,Cornwallis,"It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas."
125,4,17,Mr Hankey,"But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!"
126,4,17,Autumn,"[drunk as ever, appears at the door] Come on, it's time to sit around the tree!"
127,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[serious] We're having a talk, honey."
128,4,17,Autumn,God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!
129,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up."
130,4,17,Autumn,That's not the only thing that can't get up around here. [rushes away]
131,4,17,Mr Hankey,"...Now come on, son. Don't be so down."
132,4,17,Cornwallis,Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.
133,4,17,Mr Hankey,Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
134,4,17,Cornwallis,"I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it."
135,4,17,Mr Hankey,"No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?"
136,4,17,Cornwallis,I'm nothing but crap!
137,4,17,Mr Hankey,"But crap is everything. [begins to sing]
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
[Takes Cornwallis out and up to the street]
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
[cows graze on the some exposed grass while large birds fly lazily above]
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why

Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
[A cow poops as it eats, then Butters' family is shown eating burgers at table]
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
[Mr. Hankey sings to Cornwallis, then Butters' father is shown straining on the toilet]
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
[some poo descends through the pipe, and Mr. Hankey soon follows. A raw sewage outlet is then shown with Mr. Hankey exiting]
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
[plankton swarm the poo and devour it; a small fish eats the plankton]

And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
[a bigger fish eats the small fish, but an even bigger one approaches]
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
[the bigger fish swallows the medium-sized one and swims up to the surface, only to be snatched up by a bear]
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
[the bear walks off with the fish in its mouth and poos as he leaves]
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
[flowers and grass spring up through and around it. The camera pulls back to reveal an African savannah around the flowers, with all sorts of animals in it]

It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
[soft backup vocals come on, lending the song an African feel. antelope run in the background as a giraffe appears and stops]
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
[The camera looks at Mr. Hankey and Cornwallis atop Poo Rock, first from the back, then from the front]
''The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
[more cattle are shown grazing and pooing]
To make food for the humans and start all over again
[a man scoops the poo into a small bag and walks off; Butters and family eat more burgers; his mom sits on the toilet]
[back on Poo Rock, before which animals poo freely]

You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life."
138,4,17,Cornwallis,"But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do."
139,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[sits next to Cornwallis] Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all... [points to him] you."
140,4,17,Cornwallis,"[smiles] I think I see now.
I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground
[steps forward]"
141,4,17,Mr Hankey,Becomes the grass of tomorrow
142,4,17,Cornwallis,Yeah
143,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Which the grazers turn around 
[An antelope stops to poo a little, then runs off to join the others]"
144,4,17,Cornwallis,So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen
145,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again.
[Mr. Hankey holds Cornwallis high in the air on Poo Rock with the sky behind them. Cornwallis hums a bit]
That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!
[Cut to black]"
146,4,17,Cornwallis,"Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again.
[Mr. Hankey holds Cornwallis high in the air on Poo Rock with the sky behind them. Cornwallis hums a bit]
That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!
[Cut to black]"
147,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending."
148,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. [they walk over to some microphones.]"
149,4,17,Sound man,"[instructing] Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's."
150,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What's a hard p?
151,4,17,Eric Cartman,"You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?"
152,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, yeah."
153,4,17,Sound man,"Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and...  [cues the boys by raising his hand]"
154,4,17,The boys,We wish you a Merry Christmas
155,4,17,Sound man,Hold on.
156,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"We wish- [the sound man presses a few buttons, and some white noise blasts through the boys' headphones]"
157,4,17,The boys,[twisting in pain] AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
158,4,17,Eric Cartman,...deh..OOOWW!!!
159,4,17,Sound man,"Uh, [makes more changes to the sound settings] mmm. Okay, and? [cues the boys]"
160,4,17,Boys,"We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--"
161,4,17,Stan Marsh,Hey!  Wait a minute!
162,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What?
163,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
164,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, yes, I think so."
165,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[calmly] Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. [Kyle cues the piano player, who begins playing]"
166,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--"
167,4,17,Eric Cartman,"[grins] Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks."
168,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[throws his headphones off and faces Cartman angrily] Don't you oppress me, fat boy."
169,4,17,Eric Cartman,"[throws his headphones off] Don't call me fat, buttfucker."
170,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
171,4,17,Stan Marsh,"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! [the sound man begins to laugh heartily]"
172,4,17,Sound man,"[composes himself] Dude, that was awesome."
173,4,17,Stan Marsh,What's awesome?
174,4,17,Sound man,The script. It's sweet.
175,4,17,Stan Marsh,That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
176,4,17,Sound man,"Well, it should be in the script. All that ""you're fat"" and ""you're a Jew"" and stuff. It's great. [the boys look at each other]"
177,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame."
178,4,17,Stan Marsh,Easy.
179,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
180,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas"
181,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads. [sets the ""woo"" mouths in place] And then we shoot that for one frame."
182,4,17,Stan Marsh,Okay. [snaps the shot] One.
183,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! [exults]
184,4,17,Stan Marsh,Kickass!
185,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Now, the next mouth."
186,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. [both turn aside to look around]"
187,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, where are the E-mouths?"
188,4,17,Stan Marsh,[softly] E mouths...
189,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?"
190,4,17,Stan Marsh,[snap] 1 [snap] 2.
191,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,So how much done is that?
192,4,17,Stan Marsh,"""We wish you a m- Merry"""
193,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[softly] Aw, [loudly] Jesus Christ!"
194,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[enters the drive-in with her aides] This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year."
195,4,17,Johnson,This... place is pretty run-down.
196,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming."
197,4,17,Mr Hankey,[off-screen] Hoowwddy ho! [the Mayor and Johnson look around] Down here!
198,4,17,Johnson,[jumps back] WAAGGH!
199,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[displeased] Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful."
200,4,17,Mr Hankey,My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
201,4,17,Autumn,"[drunk and still holding a martini, to Johnson] Hi there, Mr. Important Political Person. *hic* [Johnson looks disturbed] You wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes and run naked through this parkin' lot?"
202,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[softly blocking] Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!"
203,4,17,Autumn,I didn't start it! He was looking at my breasts!
204,4,17,Mr Hankey,"They're not real, you know."
205,4,17,Autumn,"Don't you say that! [hugs him, but he pushes her off]"
206,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!"
207,4,17,Johnson,"Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup. [leads the Mayor and the other aide away]"
208,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work."
209,4,17,Cornwallis,"We can fix it up, Dad."
210,4,17,Amber,"Oh, look! A homeless person. [the man is seen sleeping on the ground covered in papers and cardboard] Oh. He looks sad, Papa. [hops over to him and leaves a poo smile on his lips] There. That's better."
211,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy [the man continues to sleep...]"
212,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. [Cartman sneezes and immediately realizes what he just did]"
213,4,17,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAAA!
214,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
215,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!"
216,4,17,Stan Marsh,"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!"
217,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways! [walks off and stops at the door] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!"
218,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[rushing to the door] Fine! We'll do it with out you!
219,4,17,Stan Marsh,"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!"
220,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,We'll dub his voice over.
221,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!"
222,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.

To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.

You hope, and I'll hurry.
[takes the poster and rolls it up.]
You pray, and I'll plan
[The boys exit the Photo Dojo with it]
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
[now in Stan's room, works on a Brian Boitano cutout]
Even a miracle needs a hand!
[walks up to the wall and adds a scene to Act II]"
223,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,You love-
224,4,17,Stan Marsh,We love
225,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,-And I'll labor. [takes down the scene]
226,4,17,Stan Marsh,Tralala
227,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,You sit- [puts it up again]
228,4,17,Stan Marsh,We sit.
229,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,-And I'll stand. [a funny look appears on his face]
230,4,17,Stan Marsh,Tralalalala
231,4,17,Boys,"Get help from our next-door neighbor, 'cause 
[Kenny begins to hum as the Hankey family is shown cleaning up the drive-in]"
232,4,17,Boys,"Even a miracle needs a hand! 
[Autumn is passed out to one side of the film projector as Mr. Hankey cleans up]"
233,4,17,Hankeys,"Even a miracle needs a hand! 
[Autumn is passed out to one side of the film projector as Mr. Hankey cleans up]"
234,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?"
235,4,17,Stan Marsh,"""Awgh! I'm so fat!"""
236,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter."
237,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[with tongue filling his mouth] ""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"""
238,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Cool! Now let's try the script!
239,4,17,Sound Man,Rolling...
240,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[Doing his and Cartman's parts]
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!"
241,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy."
242,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! [both boys grin, and the sound man signals his approval with a thumbs-up]"
243,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,You wish-
244,4,17,Stan Marsh,We wish
245,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,-And I'll whittle.
246,4,17,Stan Marsh,Tralalalala
247,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,You sit- [closes the box and tosses it up]
248,4,17,Stan Marsh,We sit.
249,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,-And I'll stand. [displays the box's destination and walks out with it]
250,4,17,Stan Marsh,Tralalalala
251,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[with Kenny humming] Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
[A group of 20 Korean inbetweeners are shown working hard on the short]"
252,4,17,Boys,"Even a miracle- [a car comes in and runs over Kenny as the driver honks, leaving Kenny flat as a pancake. The boys just look in wonder]"
253,4,17,Stan Marsh,...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. [they resume singing and walk away]
254,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Even a miracle needs a hand!! 
[Stan opens the box and both boys lift the finished reel out of it: ""FROM KOREA: FINAL PRINT""]"
255,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Even a miracle needs a hand!! 
[Stan opens the box and both boys lift the finished reel out of it: ""FROM KOREA: FINAL PRINT""]"
256,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. [the crowd erupts in applause]"
257,4,17,Eric Cartman,"[enters victoriously] Thank you, thank you. [Stan and Kyle look at him annoyed]"
258,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!"
259,4,17,Eric Cartman,"What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that."
260,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"We know that after you see this darling short film, [the crowd is shown] you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?"
261,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Mr. Hankey!"
262,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[in the booth] O-kay! [starts the projector. The opening screen of ""The Spirit of Christmas"" is shown as music plays.]"
263,4,17,Kids,"We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas--"
264,4,17,Stan Marsh,Hey!  Wait a minute!
265,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What?
266,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
267,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I think so."
268,4,17,Stan Marsh,"(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!"
269,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What?
270,4,17,Stan Marsh,You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
271,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
272,4,17,Simon,"Eehhhh, pretty! [the crowd begins to disperse and grumble]"
273,4,17,Sound Man,"Oh, that's Christmas for ya."
274,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties."
275,4,17,Man 2,Boring.
276,4,17,Man 3,I've gotta go.
277,4,17,Man 4,Stupid.
278,4,17,Mr Hankey,[as the boys enter the projection booth] It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
279,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,All that hard work.
280,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!"
281,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,But we spent it!
282,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,Fine. Then we'll sue you. [leaves with the aides] Johnson? [the other aide stays behind]
283,4,17,Aide,I... used to believe in miracles. [leaves]
284,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,All that work!
285,4,17,Stan Marsh,For nothing.
286,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry."
287,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey."
288,4,17,Eric Cartman,I guess- we might as well- go home now. [the boys leave and Mr. Hankey wilts]
289,4,17,Mr Hankey,It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
290,4,17,Cornwallis,"But Dad, we can fix the projector."
291,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap."
292,4,17,Cornwallis,"Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything."
293,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'"
294,4,17,Cornwallis,"No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same."
295,4,17,Mr Hankey,Son... [reflects for a moment] You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on! [the two of them leave the house]
296,4,17,Sharon Marsh,"Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family."
297,4,17,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,I wanna die. [sleigh music is heard and a light soon fills the air outside. All the Marshes look]
298,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What the--
299,4,17,Kenny McCormick,(Nooo!!) [tightens his hood]
300,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,They did it! They got it working! [closes the door behind him]
301,4,17,Jesus,"You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!"
302,4,17,Santa,I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
303,4,17,Jesus,Christmas is for celebrating my birth!
304,4,17,Santa,Christmas is for giving!
305,4,17,Crowd,"Oh, wow!"
306,4,17,Amber,Mom! They got it working!
307,4,17,Autumn,[opens the front door and exits without closing it] What's that? They got your father's penis workin' again? [the three of them leave]
308,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
309,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing."
310,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, ham."
311,4,17,Stan Marsh,[angrily] No not ham!
312,4,17,Eric Cartman,Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
313,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted."
314,4,17,Stan Marsh,...Christmas is about something much more important!
315,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What?
316,4,17,Stan Marsh,[voice softens] Presents.
317,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] Ah.
318,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Don't you see, Kyle?"
319,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
320,4,17,Stan Marsh,Presents.
321,4,17,Various Folk,...Presents.
322,4,17,Man 5,"My God, they're right!"
323,4,17,Mr Mackey,"Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?"
324,4,17,Randy Marsh,That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
325,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"They're starting to understand, Johnson."
326,4,17,Ms Choksondik,"We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive."
327,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[wearing a handlebar mustache, in falsetto] Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. [the crowd starts to clamor in agreement, and soon the shops around South Park turn their lights on. Red Harris opens his toy shop up, and the crowd fills the streets, first cheering, then chatting]"
328,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!"
329,4,17,Mr Hankey,"No, you did it, boys!"
330,4,17,Autumn,"Aw, hell, we all did it!"
331,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?"
332,4,17,Stan Marsh,Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
333,4,17,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
334,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Stan] Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days."
335,4,17,Stan Marsh,Wow! Count me in!
336,4,17,Eric Cartman,Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
337,4,17,Boys,"[leaving with the Mayor]
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!"
