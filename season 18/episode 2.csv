0,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,Hey guys!
1,18,2,Stan Marsh,Morning!
2,18,2,Eric Cartman,"How's it going, everybody?"
3,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Sup, Jason? [Jason turns and walks away angrily]"
4,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey dude. Sup? [they encounter Token, Craig, and Jimmy.]"
5,18,2,Craig Tucker,What are you guys doing here?
6,18,2,Eric Cartman,What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
7,18,2,Jimmy Valmer,I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
8,18,2,Token Black,"Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags."
9,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out."
10,18,2,Craig Tucker,But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
11,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-"
12,18,2,Craig Tucker,"[keeps pressing] You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves."
13,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,We were- trying to be funny.
14,18,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle. [Token, Craig and Jimmy split up, then everyone else goes their separate ways. Moments later, Wendy is shown at her locker]"
15,18,2,Stan Marsh,[walks up] Hey Wendy.
16,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,You're... back?
17,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out."
18,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[sarcastic] Oh wow, I'm shocked."
19,18,2,Stan Marsh,"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie."
20,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be ""free to chase your dreams""."
21,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing."
22,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be [does air quotes] ""dripping in bitches""?!"
23,18,2,Stan Marsh,Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? [Wendy closes her locker and faces him]
24,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! [turns around and walks away]"
25,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at us."
26,18,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)"
27,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?"
28,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?"
29,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school."
30,18,2,Pricipal Victoria,"All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?"
31,18,2,Woman,Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
32,18,2,Mr Adler,"Awww, do we need Mackey here?"
33,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing."
34,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Well, you have to admit he does look a little better."
35,18,2,Mr Adler,He doesn't look any different to me.
36,18,2,Principal Victoria,"In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?"
37,18,2,Mr Garrison,It's just the new diet fad! [a door opens]
38,18,2,Mr Mackey,"Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?"
39,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now."
40,18,2,Mr Mackey,I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
41,18,2,Mr Garrison,"[exasperated, face in his hands] Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?"
42,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off."
43,18,2,Mr Mackey,"That's probably gluten, m'kay?"
44,18,2,Coach,"Oh, God!"
45,18,2,Mr Mackey,"Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,"
46,18,2,Mr Garrison,I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
47,18,2,Mr Mackey,"See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off."
48,18,2,Principal Victoria,[surprized and interested] Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
49,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go."
50,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
51,18,2,Kenny McCormick,(Right. What the fuck is going on?)
52,18,2,Eric Cartman,"You know what we gotta do, guys? [gets off the bleachers] We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party"
53,18,2,Kenny McCormick,(A party?!)
54,18,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
55,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever."
56,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them."
57,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[joins him on the floor] Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us."
58,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for..."
59,18,2,Stan Marsh,[joins them on the floor] For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
60,18,2,Eric Cartman,What?
61,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go."
62,18,2,Eric Cartman,We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
63,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?"
64,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something."
65,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live."
66,18,2,Kenny McCormick,(This will be awesome!)
67,18,2,Eric Cartman,So who do we throw the party for?
68,18,2,Stan Marsh,"What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. [Pink's ""Get This Party Started"" begins to play, which serves as transitional music to the next scene]"
69,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, that was ""Get This Party Started"" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?"
70,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's going to be this weekend."
71,18,2,Eric Cartman,"You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time."
72,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?"
73,18,2,Eric Cartman,"You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson."
74,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him."
75,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?"
76,18,2,Scott Malkinson,I actually have plans this weekend.
77,18,2,Eric Cartman,"""I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."""
78,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?"
79,18,2,Craig Tucker,Are you guys making this up?
80,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!"
81,18,2,Craig Tucker,All the pizza we can eat?
82,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Believe it, dude."
83,18,2,Craig Tucker,"All right, this better be good."
84,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!"
85,18,2,Stan Marsh,Sweet!
86,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Next caller, what's your question?"
87,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?"
88,18,2,Stan Marsh,Excuse me?
89,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us."
90,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?"
91,18,2,Mark (voice only),"Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like ""Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"""
92,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?"
93,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face."
94,18,2,Eric Cartman,What the hell is gluten?
95,18,2,John Garner,"Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight."
96,18,2,Randy Marsh,[To Gerald] Make your dick fly off?
97,18,2,John Garner,"People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say ""Well there's fat in butter too,"" but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?"
98,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Yes, thank you!"
99,18,2,John Garner,"Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. [holds up a stalk of wheat]. Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough. [grabs a wad of dough] Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy. [puts the dough into a special washer. The extract going through a distillation process] Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein."
100,18,2,Mr Mackey,Then eat it!
101,18,2,John Garner,Excuse me?
102,18,2,Mr Mackey,"If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?"
103,18,2,John Garner,"[looks at the gluten, then at the audience, then moves the gluten to his lips] Yeah. Alright. [sips it down] Dup, dup. [his body contorts as he groans. Everyone in the audience begins to panic. He shows signs of burning up, and his groin begins to set off electrical sparks. His penis wriggles out of there and soon launches itself.]"
104,18,2,Mr Mackey,"Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. [people begin to leave the community center. The penis escapes and comes back to knock a man down]"
105,18,2,Stephen Stotch,[stops] Oh my God! These people don't even know! [faces the pizza joint] Hurry! You gotta go!
106,18,2,Mr Garrison,"[stops as well] Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there! [inside, two workers just stand around behind the counter] Get out of there!"
107,18,2,Stephen Stotch,Get out! You're not safe!
108,18,2,Mr Garrison,You gotta get out!
109,18,2,Stephen Stotch,Hurry! You gotta go!
110,18,2,Randy Marsh,What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
111,18,2,Sharon Marsh,Yes!
112,18,2,Randy Marsh,Hamburger Helper?
113,18,2,Sharon Marsh,That's all gluten!
114,18,2,Randy Marsh,"There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!"
115,18,2,Sharon Marsh,"Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having."
116,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!"
117,18,2,Sharon Marsh,"It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!"
118,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Wait, wait, ah I might need those."
119,18,2,Randy Marsh,"This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!"
120,18,2,Sharon Marsh,Don't forget the freezer!
121,18,2,Randy Marsh,Oh God! [now clearing the freezer] Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
122,18,2,Sharon Marsh,I don't know! Look at the ingredients!
123,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!"
124,18,2,Sharon Marsh,"All right, that's all of it!"
125,18,2,Randy Marsh,"You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!"
126,18,2,Sharon Marsh,"I can get both of these, yeah!"
127,18,2,Randy Marsh,"All right, come on! [a loaf of whole wheat sandwich bread falls out. Moments later, Randy comes back for it, then leaves again]"
128,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Cartman.
129,18,2,Eric Cartman,KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
130,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, calm down."
131,18,2,Eric Cartman,"THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!"
132,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,Who took all the pizza and the cake? [begins to notice flickering lights outside his window and hears an approaching crowd. All the gluten-tainted food that people have been bagging is being thrown into a bonfire] What the hell?
133,18,2,Eric Cartman,KYYYLE!
134,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!"
135,18,2,Farmer,What are you doing to my farm?!?
136,18,2,Randy Marsh,You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! [knocks him down with a right punch to the right cheek]
137,18,2,Tom Vilsack,There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!
138,18,2,Researcher,"We're working as fast as we can, sir."
139,18,2,Tom Vilsack,[sighs loudly] Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction?
140,18,2,Researcher,"[they stop by a rat cage] We gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago. You can see it already having a negative effect. [the rat is having an arousal it can't control. It flips over on its back and its penis wriggles out, and shoots off. The rat dies.]"
141,18,2,Tom Vilsack,We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?
142,18,2,Researcher,No. We believe now that that's poppycock.
143,18,2,Tom Vilsack,"[to everyone on the floor] All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis! [turns left and leaves. Another rat in the background loses its penis and dies.]"
144,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up."
145,18,2,Eric Cartman,What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
146,18,2,Stan Marsh,We can't let our party suck.
147,18,2,Eric Cartman,What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
148,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?"
149,18,2,Stan Marsh,"[looks down, then] I'll be back. [turns and leaves]"
150,18,2,Eric Cartman,You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
151,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up."
152,18,2,Eric Cartman,"[turns to his right side] There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse."
153,18,2,Randy Marsh,Yes?
154,18,2,Worker 1,"Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?"
155,18,2,Randy Marsh,Gluten expohn... oh not here!
156,18,2,Worker 2,Can we come in please?
157,18,2,Randy Marsh,Wuh sure! [shows them in. They enter and their gluten meters crackle as they go around the house]
158,18,2,Sharon Marsh,[coming down the stairs] What's going on? [one of the workers stops at the kitchen wastebasket and pulls out a pair of tongs. He rifles through the trash can with it and pulls out a Pabst Blue Ribbon can]
159,18,2,Randy Marsh,Well that's just a beer.
160,18,2,Worker 1,Oh Jesus.
161,18,2,Shelly Marsh,"BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!"
162,18,2,Randy Marsh,"[to Shelly] Shuut up, [to the worker] beer is bad for you?!"
163,18,2,Worker 2,"We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me."
164,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?"
165,18,2,Worker 1,We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.
166,18,2,Randy Marsh,No! Not Papa John's. [shakes his head] I don't wanna go to Papa John's! [shakes his head more violently] YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
167,18,2,Randy Marsh,How long do I have to stay here?!
168,18,2,Soldier,"Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir."
169,18,2,Randy Marsh,What am I supposed to eat?
170,18,2,Soldier,"It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings. [the soldier and the worker walk away]"
171,18,2,A Quarantine,How'd you get exposed? [it's a blond man on the floor] Bagels? Gravy?
172,18,2,Randy Marsh,Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
173,18,2,Mr Garrison,"There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce. [his voice grows soft] Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce."
174,18,2,Jeff White,"We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain."
175,18,2,Tom Vilsack,And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?
176,18,2,Researcher,"[approaches with an open laptop] We've been running simulations, but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics. Here, look. This is what we've been recommending for the past three years. [Shown is a food tray with dish and cup on it. The dish has larger portions for veggies and grains, smaller portions for fruits and proteins, and the cup is dairy, off to the side with the smallest portion] Five basic food groups, not four. We were wrong about that. We now realize, of course, that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison [a skull and crossbones appears over the grains]. Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers."
177,18,2,Agent,"Sir, the feds are here."
178,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Oh shit!
179,18,2,FDA Agent 1,Tom Vilsack?
180,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Yes?
181,18,2,Michael Taylor,"Michael Taylor, FDA."
182,18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem."
183,18,2,Michael Taylor,Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!
184,18,2,Stan Marsh,Dad? Dad!
185,18,2,Randy Marsh,[appears through a window] Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
186,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?"
187,18,2,Randy Marsh,"I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?"
188,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?"
189,18,2,Randy Marsh,"How's your mom? Your, your sister?"
190,18,2,Soldier 2,"[appears next to him and begins tugging at him] This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go."
191,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Nonono, not yet. DAD!"
192,18,2,Randy Marsh,"That's my son, you bastard!"
193,18,2,Soldier 2,"I'm sorry, all right?"
194,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!"
195,18,2,Randy Marsh,Staaan!
196,18,2,Stan Marsh,Let me talk to my dad! [the soldier finally hauls him away]
197,18,2,Randy Marsh,Staaaaaaan!
198,18,2,Craig Tucker,You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
199,18,2,Token Black,"Come on guys, let's go!"
200,18,2,Jimmy Valmer,"No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! [the voices mount and soon he's lifted out of bed as one last kid says ""What a loser"" which echoes and fades away. He finds himself in bayou territory]"
201,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"Hello, Eric. [he sees her, on a porch, with a plate of pancakes] Come on over here, sugar."
202,18,2,Eric Cartman,Aunt Jemima. [stands up and walks over]
203,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way."
204,18,2,Eric Cartman,"I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima."
205,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign."
206,18,2,Eric Cartman,I don't even know what that means.
207,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"When you're stuck, look to the pyramids."
208,18,2,Eric Cartman,Are you going to eat those pancakes?
209,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"They've got it wrong, child! [suddenly the scenery changes to the pyramids at Giza. Her voice takes on a cosmic tone, and Cartman spins in place] The world is upside down."
210,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Oooo, trippy..."
211,18,2,Aunt Jemima,Tell then they've got's it backwards!
212,18,2,Eric Cartman,"They've got what backward? [everything vanishes into a gray field, then a golden triangle appears, then shatters. A kaleidoscope of kids appears, taunting him. Aunt Jemima's face shatters, revealing the golden triangle.]"
213,18,2,Eric Cartman,"[he falls through his dream, surrounded by everything that has gluten in it] Noooo... [and suddenly wakes up] Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes."
214,18,2,Randy Marsh,You can't just keep us in here!
215,18,2,Mr Garrison,[clanging] We're out. [holds up an empty tray] We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
216,18,2,Blond,"[looks outside, then] They're just gonna let us starve to death?"
217,18,2,Randy Marsh,They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. [buries his face in his hands]
218,18,2,Blond,"Well then, I guess I might as well eat! [stands up and walks towards the storage room]"
219,18,2,Mr Garrison,"There's nothing left, I told you."
220,18,2,Blond,There's plenty of pizza dough.
221,18,2,Randy Marsh,Are you crazy?
222,18,2,Blond,I'm crazy hungry! [takes a wad of dough and begins eating it] Oh... Oh... Fuck it's so good. [Randy and Mr. Garrison wait for the other shoe to drop] I want more! ...it's been so long! [gets more dough and eats voraciously]
223,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, you... [the blond stops] but... you're okay."
224,18,2,Blond,"You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!"
225,18,2,Mr Garrison,A setup? But by who?
226,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out."
227,18,2,Blond,"Maybe Papa John can help us. If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can- [his penis quickly flies off and he dies]"
228,18,2,Randy Marsh,Ng-oh. [snaps his fingers. He and Garrison go find seats]
229,18,2,Stan Marsh,"There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have."
230,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller."
231,18,2,Craig Tucker,I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
232,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!"
233,18,2,Craig Tucker,"Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?"
234,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead."
235,18,2,Jamie (voice only),It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!
236,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air."
237,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?"
238,18,2,Stan Marsh,"I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-"
239,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
240,18,2,Scott Malkinson,"That is correct, yes, I do."
241,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?"
242,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus Christ, dude."
243,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now..."
244,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!"
245,18,2,Stan Marsh,"We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!"
246,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,Thought so. [hangs up. Stan lets his head fall on the table]
247,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?"
248,18,2,Eric Cartman,KYYYLE!
249,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman?
250,18,2,Eric Cartman,"KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!"
251,18,2,Tom Vilsack,It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!
252,18,2,Jeff White,Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.
253,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Who is this?
254,18,2,Eric Cartman,My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
255,18,2,Tom Vilsack,"The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure? [to the floor] Bring up the pyramid! [a programmer gets on it. An image comes up on screen, showing four food groups in four layers inside a pyramid. Grains take the bottom, widest layer, followed by fruits and vegetables, meat and dairy, and fats and oils narrowing to a point at the top]"
256,18,2,Eric Cartman,"What, what is it? What is it for?"
257,18,2,Tom Vilsack,We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.
258,18,2,Programmer,"Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved."
259,18,2,Tom Vilsack,The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
260,18,2,Eric Cartman,It's upside down.
261,18,2,Tom Vilsack,What?
262,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Sir, the pyramid is upside down."
263,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Turn the pyramid upside down.
264,18,2,Programmer 2,You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-
265,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Flip the damned food pyramid!
266,18,2,Michael Taylor,This is NOT FDA-approved!
267,18,2,Tom Vilsack,It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT! [the programmers get on it]
268,18,2,Programmer 3,"Sir, we've got a match."
269,18,2,Programmer 4,Nutrition is stabilizing!
270,18,2,Programmer 5,"We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir! [everyone cheers]"
271,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.
272,18,2,Craig Tucker,"[with butter on a stick] Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party."
273,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man."
274,18,2,Scott Malkinson,[approaches with a plate of butter on a stick] Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
275,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. [Scott walks away]"
276,18,2,Tom Vilsack,"We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again."
277,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like."
278,18,2,Tom Vilsack,We're gonna get a better view of the stage.
279,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. [takes a couple of steps and notices the ghost of Aunt Jemima over a fence. He waves at her. She waves back.]"
280,18,2,Jeff White,Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!
281,18,2,Clyde Donovan,I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
282,18,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, she isn't as hot in person."
283,18,2,Randy Marsh,"[dressed up as Lorde] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah."
284,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?"
285,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off."
286,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me."
287,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You're so transparent, Stan."
288,18,2,Stan Marsh,What does that mean?
289,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You wanna dance? [he looks back at her, smiles, and goes to dance with her.]"
290,18,2,Randy Marsh,"We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah."
