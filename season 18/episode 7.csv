0,18,7,Butters Stotch,"WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there! [Craig turns to watch] I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa... [He and Stan bump into each other and Butters begins to run his hands over him] Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it."
1,18,7,Stan Marsh,"[holding Butters off] Butters, what the hell are you doing?"
2,18,7,Butters Stotch,I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
3,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[hidden around the corner, in front of the camera] That's awesome, Butters. [snickers away from the walkie-talkie] Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? [snickers away from the walkie-talkie]"
4,18,7,Butters Stotch,"More of the school. [Clyde talks to Bebe, who seen leaves]"
5,18,7,Clyde Donovan,"What are you doing, Butters?"
6,18,7,Butters Stotch,The school and all the kids. [Clyde walks away] I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
7,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I- [mutes the walkie-talkie and whispers] He's so fucking stupid. [un-mutes it] But I'm sure they will soon."
8,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[beginning to wobble] Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- [about to take off the fake headset,]"
9,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[watching him from around the corner] Butters, no! Are you crazy?!"
10,18,7,Butters Stotch,What what what?
11,18,7,Eric Cartman,What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
12,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[turns so that he's facing away from the camera] Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!"
13,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!"
14,18,7,Butters Stotch,I'm sorry!
15,18,7,Eric Cartman,You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
16,18,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
17,18,7,Eric Cartman,You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
18,18,7,Butters Stotch,[begins to run] Oh Jesus! [Cartman looks on from around the corner]
19,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Okay, I'm back in your room!"
20,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright Butters, sit down at the computer. [Butters does this] Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!"
21,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[drops a shield over the glasses] Suppornity window dropped. [Cartman enters his room, locks the door and turns on the lights, then walks over to Butters and removes the fake headset. Butters wipes his eyes]"
22,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Welcome back, dude."
23,18,7,Butters Stotch,Wow! That was cool!
24,18,7,Eric Cartman,How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
25,18,7,Butters Stotch,I touched Wendy's boobs. [guess he feels okay.]
26,18,7,Eric Cartman,"And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back."" [pounds his left fist on the table] Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!"
27,18,7,Stan Marsh,Sound pretty typical to me.
28,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!"
29,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Coup de grah, Cartman"
30,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle."
31,18,7,Stan Marsh,Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
32,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!"
33,18,7,Butters Stotch,Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period? [in a knowing voice] Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? [chuckles]
34,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again."
35,18,7,Butters Stotch,"You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said ""Well, technically I was in school."" Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?"
36,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Right Butters. [softly over his left shoulder] These guys are so dumb, huh?"
37,18,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah. [runs off with his food tray]
38,18,7,Eric Cartman,See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
39,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?"
40,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Well, not a hundred percent..."
41,18,7,Eric Cartman,Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. [hands him the headset and Butters puts it on.]
42,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Okay, subject is ready."
43,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[picks up the walkie-talkie] Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now. [presses a few keys on the keyboard] Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?"
44,18,7,Butters Stotch,Interim status is go.
45,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[turns off the room light so the fluorescent lights stand out] Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, [raises the shield]Mark. [quickly hides in the closet as Butters gets accustomed to the headset again]"
46,18,7,Butters Stotch,It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
47,18,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside."
48,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Going now! [bumps into the door frame, then goes downstairs. A second or two later Cartman comes out of the closet, turns on the light, goes to his computer and sits on his chair]"
49,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work."
50,18,7,Butters Stotch,Okay.
51,18,7,Butters Stotch,How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
52,18,7,Eric Cartman,You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
53,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Okay. It's so realistic. [a shot of Stan watching from across the street.] The snow looks kind of fake though. [Stan leaves the window] Alright, I think that's all of it."
54,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money."
55,18,7,Butters Stotch,[rings the doorbell. A middle-aged woman answers the door with a dollar bill in her hand] There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
56,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Just take the money, Butters! [Butters reaches for the bill and takes it.]"
57,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Okay, I got it!"
58,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You got the money? [Butters walks down the walkway as the lady closes the front door] Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point."
59,18,7,Butters Stotch,Already? Oh no!
60,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back. [eats some more chips] Are you heading back Butters? [no reply.] Butters? [Butters goes home] Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid."
61,18,7,Butters Stotch,"I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. [goes inside, leaving the front door open]"
62,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!"
63,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!"
64,18,7,Stephen Stotch,I know that! What do you-?
65,18,7,Butters Stotch,This is for all the times I got grounded! [Make a fist and fires it at Stephen's groin. Stephen doubles over in pain]
66,18,7,Stephen Stotch,Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
67,18,7,Butters Stotch,"HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist! [at the other end of the call, Cartman is shocked] Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!"
68,18,7,Linda Stotch,"Butters, why?? Oh my God!"
69,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Huh, that was incredible!"
70,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[getting worried] Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now."
71,18,7,Butters Stotch,"I feel amazing! [giggles] I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?! [starts throwing rocks] Eh take that, you stupid cars! [a hit car screeches to a halt]"
72,18,7,Driver,"[steps out of the car] What the hell are you doing, Kid?!"
73,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place."
74,18,7,Butters Stotch,[knocks the driver out of the car] Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
75,18,7,Driver,Hey! [Butters peels away]
76,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now"
77,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh shit! [runs outside] Butters! Butters, where are you now?"
78,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here."
79,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?"
80,18,7,Butters Stotch,I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
81,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Wait, hang on Butters!"
82,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Take that, you dumb hooker!"
83,18,7,Hooker,What you doin' motherfucker?!
84,18,7,Butters Stotch,I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
85,18,7,Eric Cartman,Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
86,18,7,Butters Stotch,"I can't [wheeze] I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!"
87,18,7,Eric Cartman,Butters?? Butters?? [turns the walkie-talkie off]
88,18,7,Dr Carroll,"You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch."
89,18,7,Butters Stotch,I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
90,18,7,Dr Carroll,"No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine."
91,18,7,Butters Stotch,Aw nuts!
92,18,7,Dr Carroll,"Try and relax, and when your parents get here we'll sort this all out. [the doctor and nurse leave. The nurse turns off the light]"
93,18,7,Butters Stotch,I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
94,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters. [Butters looks to his right. Dramatic camera pan from Butters to Cartman, who stands on the window sill like Morpheus]"
95,18,7,Butters Stotch,Ahhh!
96,18,7,Eric Cartman,Are you okay?
97,18,7,Butters Stotch,Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
98,18,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm not here, Butters."
99,18,7,Butters Stotch,What?
100,18,7,Eric Cartman,"This is going to be hard to understand, Butters, [climbs down to the floor] but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this... [spreads his arms out] is real."
101,18,7,Butters Stotch,[looks around skeptically] Nuh uh!
102,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. [pulls off the missing thumb trick.]"
103,18,7,Butters Stotch,WHAT?? [Cartman puts on a couple of thumb lights and clicks them on and off in alternate order.]
104,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. [pulls out a wand from his sleeve and produces a bouquet of flowers from it]"
105,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[now on edge] Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!"
106,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you."
107,18,7,Butters Stotch,Ah how do you know that?!
108,18,7,Eric Cartman,[pressing a buzzer] How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? [hides under the bed]
109,18,7,Nurse,Everything okay in here?
110,18,7,Butters Stotch,Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
111,18,7,Nurse,O-kay. [turns around and walks out. Cartman comes out from the window side of the bed]
112,18,7,Eric Cartman,Butters.
113,18,7,Butters Stotch,NO!
114,18,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! [performs another trick in which he gets a coin inside a glass bottle... and succeeds]"
115,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[thoroughly scared, shuts his eyes] AAAAAAHAHAH! [he opens them moments later and Cartman is gone.]"
116,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!"
117,18,7,Eric Cartman,I'm happy that I totally got away with it. [gets a call] What's a 911 area code? Hello?
118,18,7,Steve,"Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help."
119,18,7,Eric Cartman,With what?
120,18,7,Steve,"This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend."
121,18,7,Eric Cartman,[slowly] Fuck you!
122,18,7,Steve,"I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten."
123,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You should probably listen to him, dude."
124,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality."
125,18,7,Steve,"The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend."
126,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Guys, tell him you're not computer programs."
127,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[glances at Stan and Kenny] Maybe we are.
128,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[sighs and squeezes his eyes shut for a moment] Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now."
129,18,7,Steve,"I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time."
130,18,7,Eric Cartman,Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! [Well...]
131,18,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric? Poopsiekins? [hearing no reply, she opens his door and goes in] Eric? [Steve was right. Cartman is at his computer wearing the Oculus headset, in a coma-like trance] Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now. [Cartman's left foot twitches] I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat? [this time Cartman moves his whole body] All right, I'll just leave it here, hon. [sets the burger next to the computer] I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.[exits and closes the door]"
132,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!"
133,18,7,Butters Stotch,Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
134,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED! [Butters recoils and Stephen slams the door shut. Butters turns around and goes to sit on the floor beside his bed. The door opens and Cartman enters]"
135,18,7,Eric Cartman,Are you fucking with me?!
136,18,7,Butters Stotch,...What? What do you mean?
137,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!"
138,18,7,Butters Stotch,I don't know what you mean.
139,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Because if you are, it's not cool!"
140,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!"
141,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!"
142,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh really? Oh, that's a relief."
143,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!"
144,18,7,Butters Stotch,Oh gosh!
145,18,7,Eric Cartman,That's right!
146,18,7,Butters Stotch,OH GOSH!
147,18,7,Eric Cartman,"THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?"
148,18,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
149,18,7,Eric Cartman,Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! [Butters is alarmed]
150,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[answers] Hello?
151,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!"
152,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Again?
153,18,7,Butters Stotch,"No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!"
154,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Uh huh.
155,18,7,Butters Stotch,"I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!"
156,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now."
157,18,7,Butters Stotch,PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
158,18,7,Stephen Stotch,Butters?! Who is that?!
159,18,7,Butters Stotch,Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- [Kyle looks concerned and hangs up]
160,18,7,Kenny McCormick,"[runs up to Stan and Kyle, panicked] (You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!)"
161,18,7,Kenny McCormick,(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
162,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
163,18,7,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
164,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[slowly] Fuck you!
165,18,7,Kenny McCormick,[taken aback] (What??)
166,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Get up, Cartman!"
167,18,7,Kenny McCormick,"[angry] (This isn't a prank, Kyle!)"
168,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso! [shakes Cartman's chair] You're goin' to the hospital!"
169,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, maybe this is for real."
170,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks back at Stan, then turns around to face him] Fuck you if you're in on this."
171,18,7,Stan Marsh,"In on what? [thinks a moment...] Ohh, [slowly] Fuck you!"
172,18,7,Steve,"Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares. [listens to the response] That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service. [clicks to the next caller] El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve."
173,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service."
174,18,7,Steve,"Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend. [clicks again] Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve."
175,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset."
176,18,7,Steve,"Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?"
177,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Kyle.
178,18,7,Steve,Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
179,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't care!
180,18,7,Steve,"He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems."
181,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
182,18,7,Steve,Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
183,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[rolls his eyes, then slowly] Fuck you!"
184,18,7,Stan Marsh,"""Fuck you"" what?"
185,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,He said they're doing a Total Recall.
186,18,7,Stan Marsh,Oh fuck you!
187,18,7,Steve,"All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?"
188,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,You haven't done anything yet!
189,18,7,Steve,But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
190,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
191,18,7,Steve,"Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? [Kyle looks at his phone, then at the user's manual]"
192,18,7,Eric Cartman,"It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. [the doorbell rings and he answers. It's Kyle.]"
193,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you."
194,18,7,Eric Cartman,I know. Let's go to the backyard. [turns and walks to the backyard. Kyle is quite surprised by Cartman's reaction. Moments later they takes seats at the picnic table out back. A butterfly floats by]
195,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible."
196,18,7,Eric Cartman,Okay Kyle.
197,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here."
198,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?"
199,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here."
200,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[laces his fingers together, with his index fingers making a steeple in front of his lips] Mmmhmm."
201,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me."
202,18,7,Eric Cartman,"And why did the guys send you, Kyle?"
203,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Www-what do you mean?
204,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on."
205,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Fuck you!
206,18,7,Eric Cartman,"I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle."
207,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Don't... do that!
208,18,7,Eric Cartman,Calm down.
209,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-"
210,18,7,Eric Cartman,"In virtual reality, yes you did."
211,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,No. Then I came into this virtual space.
212,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!"
213,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
214,18,7,Eric Cartman,[defeated] Fuck!
215,18,7,Best Buy Rep,Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?
216,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
217,18,7,Eric Cartman,Or if I did?
218,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?"
219,18,7,Best Buy Rep,"Sir, I'm gonna have to connect you to Customer Service. Hang on a sec. [transfers the call and hangs up. The call now reaches ... Steve!]"
220,18,7,Steve,"Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve."
221,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[stunned at the familiar voice] Dude... What?
222,18,7,Eric Cartman,What? [takes the phone from Kyle] Hello?
223,18,7,Steve,"Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future."
224,18,7,Eric Cartman,Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
225,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"[loudly] Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?"
226,18,7,Linda Stotch,"Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings."
227,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded. [hears something upstairs] And no bouncing the racquetball either!"
228,18,7,Stan Marsh,"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! [the door opens and Cartman and Kyle walk in]"
229,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait. Stan? [walks up to Stan] Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?"
230,18,7,Stan Marsh,"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real."
231,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-"
232,18,7,Stan Marsh,"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time."
233,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
234,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[still lost] No, you guys. This is virtual reality."
235,18,7,Stan Marsh,How do you know?
236,18,7,Eric Cartman,Because... I'm a computer program.
237,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,God damn it Cartman!
238,18,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real."
239,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,He's lying.
240,18,7,Eric Cartman,I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
241,18,7,Stan Marsh,What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
242,18,7,Steve,Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
243,18,7,Stan Marsh,Butters called Customer Service first?
244,18,7,Steve,Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
245,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we're going to Butters' house! [they leave Kenny behind]"
246,18,7,Steve,"Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service."
247,18,7,Steve,"Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve."
248,18,7,Steve,"Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service."
249,18,7,Steve,"Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service."
250,18,7,Steve,"Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real."
251,18,7,Steve,"...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono."
252,18,7,Steve,"My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop."
253,18,7,Steve,"[slowly, wagging his left index finger] Ohhh, fuck you!"
254,18,7,Steve,"Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?"
255,18,7,Steve,What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
256,18,7,Steve,"Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!"
257,18,7,Steve,But you didn't answer any of my questions!
258,18,7,Steve,"Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?"
259,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[singing a spiritual] I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. [his door opens and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come in]"
260,18,7,Stan Marsh,Butters.
261,18,7,Butters Stotch,[startled] Huh. But... [stands up] you guys can't be here.
262,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Why not?
263,18,7,Butters Stotch,Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
264,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
265,18,7,Butters Stotch,"When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember? [goes to the bedroom door] We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life."
266,18,7,Stan Marsh,So now we are in th real world.
267,18,7,Butters Stotch,YES.
268,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys! [the boys look at him] I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!"
269,18,7,Stephen Stotch,[appears behind him] Butters!
270,18,7,Butters Stotch,[really startled] AAaaghagh!
271,18,7,Stephen Stotch,What are your friends doing here?!
272,18,7,Butters Stotch,Huh I'm sorry Dad!
273,18,7,Steve,"Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?"
274,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Yes, we're here."
275,18,7,Steve,"Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems."
276,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!"
277,18,7,Stan Marsh,"[as Stephen chews Butters out, puts some distance between them and himself] Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?"
278,18,7,Steve,That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
279,18,7,Stan Marsh,"What?! [Stephen unbuckles his belt, Butters holds a hand up]"
280,18,7,Steve,Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
281,18,7,Stan Marsh,"That doesn't make sense! [Stephen takes his belt off. Butters closes his eyes, knowing what's coming]"
282,18,7,Steve,"That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! [the boys look at Stephen and Butters as Stephen prepares his belt for a whipping]"
283,18,7,Stephen Stotch,Well you're getting it now!
284,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!! [Stephen disappears, then Butters, then Kyle, then Cartman] You guys? Are you there?"
285,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[from a walkie-talkie] We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
286,18,7,Stan Marsh,Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. [leaves Butters' room. Stephen and Linda never really left the dining room table/ Stephen senses a change in mood]
287,18,7,Stephen Stotch,Oh my gosh! Linda!
288,18,7,Linda Stotch,"What is it, Stephen?"
289,18,7,Stephen Stotch,It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.
290,18,7,Linda Stotch,He's not?
291,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"No. I've I've got to tell him! [leaves his chair and runs up to Butters' room] Butter? Butters! [Butters is on his bed, with the curtains open, asleep]"
292,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[wakes up] Ahhh, huh?"
293,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"You can go outside and play, son."
294,18,7,Butters Stotch,"You... you, you mean ih... [sits up] I'm not grounded?"
295,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over."
296,18,7,Butters Stotch,They did it! [hops off his bed] They figured it out! [heads out the door] Whoopie!
297,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?"
298,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
299,18,7,Stan Marsh,"[goes upstairs and enters Cartman's room] Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room."
300,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. [Stan does this]"
301,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, dude, take off the headset. [Stan reaches up and removes the headset. At this point the animation switches to live-action. Stan finishes taking off the headset as Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny watch]"
302,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?"
303,18,7,Stan Marsh,"[thoughtfully looking at the headset] It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck."
