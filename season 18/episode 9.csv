0,18,9,Gerald Broflovski,"There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley."
1,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together."
2,18,9,Gerald Broflovski,It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
3,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship."
4,18,9,Gerald Broflovski,"All right. [Kyle smiles, Gerald heads back to the kitchen] I swear I'll never understand you kids these days."
5,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yes! [runs upstairs smiling.]
6,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Heeey Ike! Look what I got. [Ike looks over his shoulder] The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
7,18,9,PewDiePie,"[on the monitor] Aww, look at all the bright colors."
8,18,9,Ike Broflovski,...Meh. [goes back to watching the monitor and eating his Cheetos]
9,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!"
10,18,9,Ike Broflovski,"Maybe later, 'kay?"
11,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up to Ike] Well what are you watching?
12,18,9,PewDiePie,"How's it goin' bros? My name's PewDiePie. I'm playing Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Here we go. [breaks through a door and is met with gunfire] Agh! People are shooting at me, bros!"
13,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
14,18,9,Ike Broflovski,[claps] PewDiePie!
15,18,9,PewDiePie,There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
16,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?"
17,18,9,PewDiePie,"All right, I hope that's enough."
18,18,9,Ike Broflovski,Meh.
19,18,9,PewDiePie,"Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig! [fires away at will]"
20,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days."
21,18,9,Butters Stotch,What's a PewDiePie do?
22,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame."
23,18,9,Eric Cartman,"He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?"
24,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!"
25,18,9,Concert Announcer,"This Saturday, at the Pepsi Center, it's Women of Rock! Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, Nicki Minaj, and Lorde! [Randy] All on one stage, on one night! With a special appearance by Michael Jackson's Hologram!"
26,18,9,MJ Hologram,Hee hee!
27,18,9,Concert Announcer,"Ticket proceeds help fight the gluten crisis in West Africa! It's a night of pure, pure estrogen! Tickets on sale now! [TeleChargeIt and TicketMastering info go up]"
28,18,9,Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!"
29,18,9,Record Executive,"Come on, this is a great lineup."
30,18,9,Randy,"Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no."
31,18,9,Record Executive,I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
32,18,9,Randy,What is that supposed to mean?
33,18,9,Record Executive,I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
34,18,9,Randy,"Yes, Freemium gaming."
35,18,9,Record Executive,"I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush. [Randy sighs] You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over. [hangs up. Randy ends the call]"
36,18,9,Randy,I love Candy Crush.
37,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
38,18,9,Stan Marsh,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
39,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary."
40,18,9,Kenny McCormick,(Commentary?)
41,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! [Cartman eyes his phone with Stan and Kenny look at Kyle]"
42,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. [a recording of the earlier conversation plays]"
43,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
44,18,9,Eric Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan."
45,18,9,Stan Marsh,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
46,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what."
47,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it."
48,18,9,Kenny McCormick,(Commentary?)
49,18,9,Eric Cartman,There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
50,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
51,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! [anxiously waits for an answer]"
52,18,9,Sharon,"I don't know, Shelly."
53,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! [Randy and Sharon turn around]"
54,18,9,Randy,"Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up."
55,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!"
56,18,9,Randy,And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
57,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!"
58,18,9,Randy,"You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow."
59,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh",So can I go or not?!
60,18,9,Randy,If she means that much to you.
61,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. [smiles and walks away]"
62,18,9,Sharon,Sooo you're doing it? [smiles]
63,18,9,Randy,How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
64,18,9,Sharon,Of course not. [Randy walks away and out of earshot] Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
65,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty."
66,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[goes into the room] Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?"
67,18,9,Eric Cartman,"More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start."
68,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!"
69,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
70,18,9,Eric Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan."
71,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,[approaches the monitor] What the fuck?!
72,18,9,Stan Marsh,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
73,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what."
74,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!"
75,18,9,Eric Cartman,"God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!"
76,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
77,18,9,Ike Broflovski,CartmaaanBrah!
78,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,What do you think you're doing?!
79,18,9,Eric Cartman,Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
80,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
81,18,9,Eric Cartman,I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
82,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
83,18,9,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about?
84,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
85,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle."
86,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Let's Plays?
87,18,9,Eric Cartman,"That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. [turns to the basket and takes his shot. Kyle looks away and down]"
88,18,9,Miley Cyrus,"There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
Throw my hands in the air while I'm twerkin' this chair
There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
And I'm movin' my hands while I'm shakin' my tits."
89,18,9,Stagehand,"Alright guys, Uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde. [walks out of the dressing room backwards] Have a great show, ladies."
90,18,9,Randy,"Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work."
91,18,9,Record Executive,"You're nervous, it's understandable."
92,18,9,Randy,No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
93,18,9,Record Executive,"You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit."
94,18,9,Randy,Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
95,18,9,Iggy Azalea,"Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!"
96,18,9,Randy,"No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models."
97,18,9,Iggy Azalea,"That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!"
98,18,9,Randy,"Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you."
99,18,9,Iggy Azalea,'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!
100,18,9,Randy,Fuck you! [they start fighting and break through a table full of finger good and drinks]
101,18,9,Record Executive,Alright that's enough! [breaks up the scuffle and separates the two artists] Look at yourselves!
102,18,9,Iggy Azalea,"You're an Internet bullshit artist, Lorde!"
103,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what's up?"
104,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're not gonna believe this.
105,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, what now?"
106,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition."
107,18,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
108,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Come on! [leads Stan upstairs]
109,18,9,PewDiePie,[giggling] He's just laying there.
110,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
111,18,9,PewDiePie,"I'm going ""Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun."""
112,18,9,Kindergarten Kids,[in unison] PewDiePie!
113,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
114,18,9,Butters Stotch,Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
115,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!"
116,18,9,Kindergarten Kids,CartmanBrah!
117,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!"
118,18,9,Conner,"Okay Grandpa, we'll be sure to keep that in mind. [the kids laugh]"
119,18,9,Stan Marsh,Grandpa?
120,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"This is how they talk to us! [to Conner] You'd better watch your mouth, kid!"
121,18,9,Kid 1,"Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember?"
122,18,9,Kid 2,It's best to just make old people think they matter.
123,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!"
124,18,9,Kid 2,No sir. Thank goodness we have you to do that. [Ike laughs at PewDiePie's gameplay]
125,18,9,Stan Marsh,We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
126,18,9,PewDiePie,Oh my God I killed him!
127,18,9,Iggy Azalea,"Missy who who?
That's all I do is rip off Missy.
Missy who?
Missy who? Missy who? Missy who who? Missy who who?


Alright bitches and hos, via hologram and shit, Michael Jackson! [two men from the Syntech Hologram Company get ready]"
128,18,9,Tech 1,"And, cue the hologram! [a bunch of special lights come on and produce the hologram, and the hologram performs Michael's signature moves. The crowd goes wild as Michael's music plays. The hologram moonwalks like Michael did]"
129,18,9,MJ Hologram,"Hee hee. [as the crowd roars, Iggy starts twerking to the hologram]"
130,18,9,Randy,They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
131,18,9,Nicki Minaj,"Oh Lorde, you're such a purist."
132,18,9,Randy,"Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something."
133,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,Hi everybody. I love you!
134,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,Thanks for loving me. I love you too.
135,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,"So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy?? [the audience cheers in agreement] Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! [Instead of Cartman himself appearing on the couch, Cartman's commenter window pops up - he's doing this via satellite]"
136,18,9,Eric Cartman,CartmaaanBrah!
137,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
138,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well."
139,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,And why do you think young people-?
140,18,9,Eric Cartman,CartmaaanBrah!
141,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,...Why do you think young people are responding to this? [Cartman mocks the question by asking it back in nonsense syllables] I'm asking you a question! [Cartman continues with the nonsense replies]
142,18,9,Eric Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs."
143,18,9,MC,"And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE!"
144,18,9,Randy,"Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there! [begins playing an acoustic guitar. Shelly is in the audience with Kelly and Stacy] Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya. [the cheering dies down] Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy. [the mood of the audience begins to change] Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya. [the audience begins to boo] And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh. [turns right and the mic falls to the ground] Oh God. Sorry. [bends over to pick up the mic...] Uh hold on.[...but drops the guitar instead. The boos intensify] Hang on, uh. [to bail Lorde out of this mess, the technicians bring Michael's hologram back to the stage]"
145,18,9,MJ Hologram,Hee hee. [the hologram runs through the audience] I'm free! I'm free!
146,18,9,Randy,"[dusts himself off] Sorry folks, just one second here."
147,18,9,MJ Hologram,Hee hee. Dah dadit dat ja!
148,18,9,Guard 1,"Stop him. [another guard tries to grab the hologram, but realizes it can't be done. The hologram leaves the Center. The guards run out after it, and a guard guard gets on his walkie-talkie]"
149,18,9,Guard 1,Michael Jackson's hologram is on the loose!
150,18,9,MJ Hologram,[leaving the parking area] Hee hee!
151,18,9,Randy,"Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a. [the boos don't stop, and Randy's vision becomes prismatic] Okay, uh, uh... [steps aside and begins to simulate rubbing his ""clit""] Oooo![hops onto the car on stage and continues the simulation] Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! [the boos are replaced by disgust. Shelly and friends are disappointed]"
152,18,9,Lorde Fan,"Ogh! Lorde, ewww!"
153,18,9,Randy,"Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! [fans begin to walk out of the concert]"
154,18,9,Randy,"Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan? [Stan reaches to his left and passes the potatoes to Randy] Great, thanks. [serves himself some potatoes] Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?"
155,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?"
156,18,9,Randy,I was told to!
157,18,9,Sharon,"You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit."
158,18,9,Randy,"Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! [Stan hisses and leaves the table. Sharon just leaves. Some time later, Randy drops in on Shelly in her room and sees her crying on her bed, face down. He then notices that the Lorde poster on the wall is in tatters and ripped in half. Randy leaves and closes the door softly]"
159,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's dying. The living room is... dying.
160,18,9,Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?"
161,18,9,Record Executive,What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
162,18,9,Randy,"Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-"
163,18,9,Record Executive,"It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!"
164,18,9,Randy,This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
165,18,9,Passenger,"Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?"
166,18,9,MJ Hologram,Yes.
167,18,9,Passenger,"You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'?"
168,18,9,MJ Hologram,"No, I just need to... take care of some im-, important business."
169,18,9,Passenger,"Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman?"
170,18,9,MJ Hologram,"Yes. I mean, yes, that's all. I'm, I'm just gonna fish and hunt."
171,18,9,Passenger,"Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon?"
172,18,9,MJ Hologram,[stands up] Nobody! That's ignorant!
173,18,9,Passenger,"Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey?"
174,18,9,MJ Hologram,Allegedly! Allegedly! That's ignorant!
175,18,9,Passenger,"You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent."
176,18,9,MJ Hologram,...That's ignorant. I'm just cold.
177,18,9,Passenger,I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.
178,18,9,MJ Hologram,"Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant!"
179,18,9,Passenger,"[looks him over] Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it."
180,18,9,MJ Hologram,"Oh I will. Trust me, I will. [The bus enters South Park.]"
181,18,9,Tech 2,"Ah, we've lost any ability to track the hologram's location. Ih...it looks like it reprogrammed its guidance systems."
182,18,9,Record Executive,We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back!
183,18,9,Tech 3,Project Alpha?
184,18,9,Tech 4,Yes. That might be our only option.
185,18,9,Record Executive,What is Project Alpha?
186,18,9,Tech 4,The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-
187,18,9,Tech 3,Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha!
188,18,9,Tech 2,"Sir, are you sure that we wanna-?"
189,18,9,Tech 3,Bring it up! [Tech 2 gets to work. Everyone turns around and watches as the hologram is assembled]
190,18,9,Record Executive,What is that?
191,18,9,Tech 3,Tupac.
192,18,9,Tech 4,"[approaches the hologram] Tupac? [the hologram is activated] Yo. The hologram of Michael Jackson is on the loose. We need you to ""take care of the situation."" [the hologram takes out a Glock hologram and cocks it, then he walks forward, then turns left and walks out]"
193,18,9,Tech 3,"Godspeed, Tupac."
194,18,9,Man,"Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I told you them homies didn't cap his ass! [Tupac opens the driver's door, pulls the driver out and throws him to the ground, then gets into the driver's seat and takes off with the car and driver's wife. The driver gets up and pulls out his phone] Oh, this is going on Instagram! [takes the picture]"
195,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now. [the other three boys walk into view] Yep, there's Kyle, Stan and Kenny looking stupid as ever."
196,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
197,18,9,Stan Marsh,Tell me about it.
198,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!"
199,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV."
200,18,9,Eric Cartman,[exasperated] Oh God.
201,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,[notices the commenter window above the bus stop sign] Do you mind?!
202,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated"
203,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
204,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!"
205,18,9,Randy,Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. [the executive puts down his fork and wipes his lips off with a napkin.]
206,18,9,Record Executive,"Sit down, Lorde."
207,18,9,Randy,I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
208,18,9,Record Executive,"[stands up and walks to a nearby bar] Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more. [pours himself a drink] Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on. [turns around] The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level."
209,18,9,Randy,Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
210,18,9,Record Executive,On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
211,18,9,Randy,I'll do no such thing!
212,18,9,Record Executive,"Who said anything about you? [whips out a small remote control and presses a button on it. Some lasers turn on and assemble a new hologram. It's Lorde's hologram. It walks up to the executive and stands beside him. Randy is frightened and takes several steps back. Two bodyguards appear behind him, and he notices. The executive closes the blinds]"
213,18,9,Randy,You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
214,18,9,Record Executive,"Today, commentary IS the content. And you, I'm afraid, are just in the way. [the bodyguards quickly escort him out]"
215,18,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle."
216,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to the front of the class and turns around. He reads from a sheet of paper] What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-"
217,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up] Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake."
218,18,9,Mr Garrison,What the hell is that?
219,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
220,18,9,Eric Cartman,Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
221,18,9,Mr Garrison,What the hell?
222,18,9,Eric Cartman,"This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison."
223,18,9,Butters Stotch,It's true!
224,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch."
225,18,9,Butters Stotch,Heheyehah.
226,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
227,18,9,Eric Cartman,[mocking] There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
228,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!"
229,18,9,Mr Garrison,I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
230,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
231,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[mocking] This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something."
232,18,9,Mr Mackey,"Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!"
233,18,9,Eric Cartman,What the hell did I do?
234,18,9,Principal Victoria,"Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction."
235,18,9,Eric Cartman,Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
236,18,9,Principal Victoria,"Eric, I am talking to YOU!"
237,18,9,Eric Cartman,Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
238,18,9,Randy,Sharon? Sharon!
239,18,9,Sharon,[comes down the stairs in her bath robe] Randy? What's going on?
240,18,9,Randy,"They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!"
241,18,9,Sharon,"Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?"
242,18,9,Randy,The hologram's in our bedroom?
243,18,9,Sharon,Yes!
244,18,9,Tupac s Hologram,"I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit."
245,18,9,Randy,You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
246,18,9,Record Executive,"It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?"
247,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[in his commenter window] Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!"
248,18,9,Record Executive,Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
249,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!"
