0,18,8,Girl 1,[handing out fliers] Hey guys. [Clyde takes one] Thanks. Support your team? Thank you. Hey guys. Did you get one of these? [walks up to Cartman and Craig] Hope you can make it.
1,18,8,Eric Cartman,[takes a flier] What's this?
2,18,8,Girl 1,The girls' volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
3,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[looks at Craig.] Girls volleyball? [they both laugh at the thought] Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy."
4,18,8,Girl 2,What's wrong with supporting girls' athletics?!
5,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay? [hands the flier back to girl 1] All right."
6,18,8,Girl 3,"[walks up to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is ""We're too busy."""
7,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
8,18,8,Girl 3,What fight?
9,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls' volleyball. [he, Kenny, and Kyle laugh]"
10,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch."
11,18,8,Magic Player/ Slaughterhouse,"Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my Elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on."
12,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,Can Kenny block his Elderbeast?
13,18,8,Stan Marsh,Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
14,18,8,Eric Cartman,This asshole needs to make a move already!
15,18,8,Referee,"Quiet in the peanut gallery, please."
16,18,8,Magic Player/ Slaughterhouse,"I am attacking, but with a newly summoned Spark Ghast who has Trample. Four damage to your planeswalker."
17,18,8,Boys,Ohhhh!
18,18,8,Butters Stotch,Oh no! Kenny!
19,18,8,Stan Marsh,Shhh!
20,18,8,Butters Stotch,But he's dying! [Kenny lays down a card]
21,18,8,Stan Marsh,What's that?
22,18,8,Eric Cartman,He's playing an enchantment.
23,18,8,Stan Marsh,This late?
24,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
25,18,8,Magic Player/ Slaughterhouse,I can block that with Uprooted Minotaur. [Kenny lays down his next card]
26,18,8,Boys,Ohhhh!
27,18,8,Referee,Serendib Sorcerer unblocked. Winner: McCormick!
28,18,8,Boys,Yeeahhh!
29,18,8,Magic Player/ Slaughterhouse,Nnoohhh!
30,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, it was complete brutality!"
31,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,You've never seen anything so ruthless!
32,18,8,Stan Marsh,It was seriously almost hard to watch. [Wendy appears in the distance and walks over to the boys]
33,18,8,Eric Cartman,"At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!"
34,18,8,Stan Marsh,"[sees Wendy] Wendy, did you hear about last night?"
35,18,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, I heard the girls' volleyball team won by like 20 points."
36,18,8,Stan Marsh,Not that. Did you actually go to that?
37,18,8,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
38,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Pfft, whatever."
39,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this! [the janitor finally looks at the group] It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!"
40,18,8,Janitor Mitchell,"Hey! Pssst! [the boys see him] Come over here. [the boys walk over to him while the other kids disperse] You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?"
41,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro."
42,18,8,Janitor Mitchell,"Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit."
43,18,8,Stan Marsh,We're men.
44,18,8,Janitor Mitchell,"Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here. [hands them a sheet of paper with an address on it, and Kyle steps forward to take it] This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet. [turns right and leaves] And you might wanna pack a barf bag."
45,18,8,Eric Cartman,[steps forward and watches him leave] Kewwwl!
46,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok."
47,18,8,Eric Cartman,What's hardcore and exciting about Chity shrimp? [they approach the doors]
48,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,It doesn't even look like they're open. [tugs and knocks at the doors]
49,18,8,Mr Tuong,[unlocks the doors and answers them] We crosed! We crosed for the night! Go away prease! [waves them away]
50,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?"
51,18,8,Mr Lu Kim,You purice?
52,18,8,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
53,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, do we look like police?"
54,18,8,Mr Lu Kim,"Okay, come on, come on, five dorrah, five dorrah each! Come on, five dorrah!"
55,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Five dorrah?! [Mr. Lu Kim hushes them quickly and leads them to the back room, which leads to the basement. Lu Kim opens the basement door]"
56,18,8,Mr Lu Kim,"You go down! Go down, find seat! We in sixth fight! Gogogogogogogo! [the kids go in, then Mr. Tuong, who closes the door behind him.]"
57,18,8,Announcer,Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card. Fluffy counters with a mana card of his own. And he plays a Fugitive Wizard!
58,18,8,Crowd,Ooooooo.
59,18,8,Announcer,"More mana from Scrambles! And yes, that is Crippling Blight! Crippling Blight to the Fugitive Wizard! Creature now has -1 to strength and defense! More Mana from Fluffy. Now he'll attack with Fugitive Wizard, and there's an instant attack from Scrambles! That is Peel from Reality! Fugitive Wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!"
60,18,8,The boys,Whoa!
61,18,8,Announcer,The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!
62,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that was total carnage!"
63,18,8,Stan Marsh,That was freakin' hardcore.
64,18,8,Eric Cartman,Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
65,18,8,Stan Marsh,It was just decimation.
66,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
67,18,8,Eric Cartman,"We're going again on Friday, right?"
68,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Hell yeah! [Kenny lowers his head, and Cartman notices]"
69,18,8,Eric Cartman,What's the matter Kenny?
70,18,8,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
71,18,8,Stan Marsh,What's mean about it?
72,18,8,Kenny McCormick,[mumbles]
73,18,8,Eric Cartman,You feel bad for the roosters?
74,18,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)"
75,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard."
76,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally."
77,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder."
78,18,8,Kenny McCormick,(No.)
79,18,8,Eric Cartman,Huh? A little bit?
80,18,8,Kenny McCormick,(NO.)
81,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster."
82,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!"
83,18,8,Eric Cartman,"What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. [Kenny just looks at his meal]"
84,18,8,Det Harris,"Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?"
85,18,8,Stuart McCormick,What do you mean?
86,18,8,Det Harris,"Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it."
87,18,8,Stuart McCormick,What's cock Magic?
88,18,8,Det Harris,"Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play ""Magic: the Gathering,"" and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?"
89,18,8,Stuart McCormick,I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
90,18,8,Det Harris,"Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong, and anyone I find involved with this filth is goin' down!"
91,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!"
92,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, it's not that big a deal."
93,18,8,Randy Marsh,"It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college."
94,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,You were?
95,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. [whips out a handkerchief, and drums begin to play. Randy places the hankey over his pants and begins a demonstration of cock magic, as he knew it]"
96,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic."
97,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh? Not impressed? How about this? [makes his penis pop out right, left, down... up, left. Stan hides his face in his hand while his friends are speechless]"
98,18,8,Voice,What is it?!
99,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?"
100,18,8,Voice,"Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters."
101,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything."
102,18,8,Breeder,"[The voice, opens up and lets them in] Come on to the back, don't mind the smell. [he takes the boys to his barn and shows them around] We only deal in the highest quality poultry Planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?"
103,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,We don't... really know the difference.
104,18,8,Breeder,"Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks."
105,18,8,Stan Marsh,Do you think they're happy?
106,18,8,Breeder,Do I think they're happy?
107,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?"
108,18,8,Breeder,[thinks a moment] They're fuckin' chickens.
109,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?"
110,18,8,Breeder,Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
111,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny?"
112,18,8,Stan Marsh,"[off-screen] Hey, how about this little guy?"
113,18,8,Breeder,That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.
114,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,Then he's perfect for us.
115,18,8,Eric Cartman,"What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about ""McNuggets""?"
116,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
117,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[mimicking a rooster] ""Yes I do, you guys."" [normally] Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?"
118,18,8,Shelly Marsh,"Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour!"
119,18,8,Sharon Marsh,Randy?
120,18,8,Randy Marsh,[lounge voice] Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
121,18,8,Sharon Marsh,"[Sharon pounds on the door] Randy, what are you doing?!"
122,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind. [back to the lounge voice] Hey!"
123,18,8,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, why are there drums playing? [the drums stop and Randy opens the door]"
124,18,8,Randy Marsh,"All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback."
125,18,8,Sharon Marsh,"Ohhh, no no nononononono no."
126,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college."
127,18,8,Sharon Marsh,I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
128,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer."
129,18,8,Sharon Marsh,Stanley??
130,18,8,Randy Marsh,"People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh! [a hankey drapes his erect penis] Oh my gosh! [pulls the hankey off and the penis is back in his pants. He smiles, she walks away, his smile fades, and he goes back into the bathroom and shuts the door]"
131,18,8,Announcer,"Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying! And now he casts Geistflame, dealing one damage to McNuggets."
132,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[through gritted teeth] Come on, McNuggets! Fight!"
133,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You can do it, McNuggets! [the crowd argues around them]"
134,18,8,Announcer,"Quiet, please."
135,18,8,Someone,I think I'll bet on the next one.
136,18,8,Announcer,"Waaiitt! [the crowd gets quiet] McNuggets has cast Punishing Fire, absorbing the Geistflame and dealing two damage to the opponent! Game, set and match, McNuggets!"
137,18,8,Crowd,Whoa!
138,18,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
139,18,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, McNuggets!"
140,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, McNuggets! [after the fights the boys leave City Wok] Did we pick the right rooster or what?!"
141,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[carrying McNuggets in a small cage] That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls' volleyball."
142,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,[comes out behind the boys with two bodyguards] Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.
143,18,8,Eric Cartman,Thank you so very much.
144,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?
145,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,You mean there's more to this?
146,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,"Oh, yes. And I'm not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I'm talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here's the address. [again Kyle takes the slip of paper] Let's see what kind of money your cock can really make."
147,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Gee, thanks!"
148,18,8,Eric Cartman,"You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!"
149,18,8,Woman,"Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on."
150,18,8,Kindergarten boy,"Yay, a show, a show!"
151,18,8,Woman,Do you kids like magic?
152,18,8,Kindergartners,"Yeah, yay!"
153,18,8,Woman,"Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randy! [leaves as Randy enters, and the kids cheer]"
154,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Hey kids, are we having fun? [places his hat over his groin, then reaches for it on his head] Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? [no reaction from the kids. Inside, the parents are preparing the cake]"
155,18,8,Woman,"[mixing some lemonade] Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready."
156,18,8,Randy Marsh,"[with his penis in a box and a saw in his left hand] Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic... [begins to saw through the box] you'll find that- [the saw hits something that produces gushes of blood. All the kids are hit and they panic] Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!"
157,18,8,Man,"[chuckles] They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?"
158,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?! [the girl reaches behind her ear and pulls out a detached penis. She screams and Randy takes it from her.] Oh, it was behind her ear. [goes back to the stage and pops it right back where it should be, hidden so the kids don't see what he's actually doing] And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randy! Thank you! [kids are still screaming]"
159,18,8,Kindergarten boy,I hate you!
160,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit."
161,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
162,18,8,Craig Tucker,Where was all this?
163,18,8,Eric Cartman,"We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit."
164,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you gotta know people."
165,18,8,Butters Stotch,"Dangit, I wish I knew people."
166,18,8,Mr Garrison,"All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls' volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. [goes to his desk as she enters]"
167,18,8,Girls Volleyball Coach,"Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout."
168,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh Jesus, give it a rest already."
169,18,8,Butters Stotch,[chuckling] Yeah.
170,18,8,Girls Volleyball Coach,"You know, when you put your all into something, it's kind of a bummer when people don't seem to care. [focus on Kenny, who looks down] Kind of makes you feel like the sport you love is becoming a joke."
171,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill."
172,18,8,Eric Cartman,OOHHH!! [laughs with the other boys]
173,18,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Fantastic girls' volleyball joke, Stan."
174,18,8,Girls Volleyball Coach,"The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls' volleyball team."
175,18,8,Wendy Testaburger,"[gets up and goes to the front of the class. Stan is immediately stunned] Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. [goes back to her seat]"
176,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[aside, to Stan] Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that."
177,18,8,Man,"And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh."
178,18,8,Det Harris,Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? [the man and wife look at each other]
179,18,8,Man,Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.
180,18,8,Det Harris,"Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?"
181,18,8,Woman,Decks??
182,18,8,Man,"Who? There weren't any ""decks."""
183,18,8,Det Harris,"Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?"
184,18,8,Woman,"[in tears] I'm so confused, babe."
185,18,8,Det Harris,Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
186,18,8,Man,"Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!"
187,18,8,Det Harris,Agreed! Who first called 911? [moments later the woman is being taken to a squad car as the man and their daughter look on]
188,18,8,Woman,Please! Don't take me away from my child!
189,18,8,Girl 1,[crying] Mommy!
190,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
191,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. [they stand before Panda Express. Again, Kyle knocks on the doors and tugs at them.]"
192,18,8,Panda Express Manager,"[opens the door] Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!"
193,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic."
194,18,8,Panda Express Manager,"Oh okay, come on, ten dorrah, ten dorrah."
195,18,8,Eric Cartman,Ten dorrah?! [the boys hand over $10 each]
196,18,8,Announcer 2,"For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky."
197,18,8,Eric Cartman,Who is that??
198,18,8,Spectator 1,"That's Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. [Gadnuk is wearing a gold medallion] He's never lost a fight. Hell, he's never even lost one health!"
199,18,8,Stan Marsh,[following the cock Magic fight over the phone] What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
200,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!"
201,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
202,18,8,Eric Cartman,"McNuggets is scared, dude!"
203,18,8,Stan Marsh,Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
204,18,8,Spectator 2,[returns to the crowd with a dead bird] He didn't stand a chance. Not one spell cast before he was obliterated by health drains! That thing isn't human! [walks away with his rooster. Gadnuk throws down a card. The promoter walks up]
205,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,"Alright, your rooster's up next, boys."
206,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude."
207,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,He doesn't have a choice.
208,18,8,Eric Cartman,This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
209,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,What do you think all these people are here to see?
210,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!"
211,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,The hell you do! Get your cock in there! [Kenny sighs and goes in instead]
212,18,8,ESPN Announcer,"You're watching ESPN Illegal, your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic."
213,18,8,ESPN Host,"And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move. [Gadnuk ponders what to do while Kenny slowly taps his fingers on the table, waiting] Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds plays a creature card. [his assistant places it on the table]"
214,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack."
215,18,8,Crowd,Whooaa.
216,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Kenny! [Kenny take a card from a deck and looks through his other cards]"
217,18,8,Stan Marsh,What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
218,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health."
219,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,He just had to shuffle it.
220,18,8,Eric Cartman,Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer.
221,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Does an Overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! [meanwhile, the ball goes to #36, who hits it back over the net]"
222,18,8,ESPN Host,"A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH, and he's just laid down Life's Legacy!"
223,18,8,Crowd,Ooooohh...
224,18,8,ESPN Host,That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!
225,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Holy shit, dude!"
226,18,8,ESPN Host,"Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this!"
227,18,8,Det Harris,"Freeze! [comes down to the basement with reinforcements. The cops draw their guns and check everyone out there. One cop pulls a gun from a spectator's jacket and throws it to the ground] Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time! [looks at Kenny] Especially you, scumbag!"
228,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,Lousy cops! How did you find us?
229,18,8,Det Harris,"We saw your fliers. [holds one up] ""Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm."""
230,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,We didn't put those fliers out!
231,18,8,Announcer,"[spotlights come on and move out over the crowd] And now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the Amazingly Randy! [A stage is lit up and Randy bounds out]"
232,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Ah, dude, your dad's here."
233,18,8,Randy Marsh,"[lounge voice] Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing. [dances over to a stool nearby with a box sitting on it] Whatever you believe is real, is real. [pulls out a hankey, then goes back to center stage and shows there's nothing odd about it. He unzips his zipper and puts the hankey on his penis. He gets a rubber band and ties the hankey around the penis. Next he moves his hand around and his penis rises in response, as if his hands had some magnetic power to them. Suddenly, the penis takes flight and goes around several times. He holds up a large ring and the penis flies through it flawlessly. He turns around and the song ""Barbie Girl"" plays. He drops his pants, dances a bit, then turns around with a small curtain over his legs. The penis peaks out to the right, up, left, and then a life-size head appears popping out to the right]"
234,18,8,Head,"Come on Barbie, let's go party. [Randy pushes it gently behind the curtain again, then he squats just long enough to get his pants back up and remove the curtain. Then he hops around. He hops back to the stool and gets some body lotion to lubricate his penis with. Then he pretends to stroke his penis and a bouquet of flowers pops up. He tosses the bouquet into the crowd and a woman catches it]"
235,18,8,Spectator 3,Ewww! [throws the bouquet away]
236,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?"
237,18,8,Det Harris,I'll volunteer.
238,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Alright, come on up here. [Harris goes up] What's your name?"
239,18,8,Det Harris,"I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police."
240,18,8,Randy Marsh,"All right, a hand for Detective Harris! [applause. This provides a distraction by which some spectators leave silently] You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals. [grabs a tank of liquid nitrogen] Sir? [gives it to Harris, who holds it. Drumroll. Randy takes a funnel and puts one end on his penis, then motions for Harris to pour the nitrogen into the funnel. A few seconds later, the funnel comes off to reveal a frozen penis. Randy takes a gun out and shoots it to bits. Harris is stunned. Randy walks over to him and smiles. All of a sudden, the penis comes out of Harris' mouth. Randy take it and puts it into his pants. Harris smiles. Only four cops remain and they clap. The crowd and the other cops have left.]"
241,18,8,Eric Cartman,"It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up."
242,18,8,Butters Stotch,"Wow, the cops came?"
243,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened."
244,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?"
245,18,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)"
246,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?"
247,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys."
248,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,Got what?
249,18,8,Stan Marsh,A way to finally do something good for other people.
250,18,8,Announcer,"South Park serves, and McNuggets plays a Plains Land card. One-nil, South Park. [a smattering of applause. Wendy serves again] Another serve, and McNuggets summons Downtreader Elk. One South Park player is eliminated. You, the girl with the ponytails - you are dead."
