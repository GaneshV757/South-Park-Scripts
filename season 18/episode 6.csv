0,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks over his shoulder] Kyle, hang on a sec. [He's holding his phone, on which is a Terrance & Phillip game]"
1,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns to face him] Hey, Jimmy. What's up?"
2,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun."
3,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. Really?
4,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?"
5,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[considers it for a moment] Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out."
6,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"You betcha, pal. [grins. Kyle turns and walks away and the grin fades. Jimmy turns and continues on his way]"
7,18,6,Announcer,"The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game. [The game goes from the splash screen to a layout of their town, starting at their house. Coins float over the streets, ready to be grabbed. The announcer pops into view] In this game, you are Terrance & Phillip. Can you collect all the Canadian coins? *poot* [disappears.]"
8,18,6,Announcer,"That's one coin. Can you collect more? [Kyle taps on more coins on the screen] You've collected ten Canadian coins! [a big red 10 appears on a yellow star] Congratulations! [that word, also in red, appears above the 10] Hey, you're really good at this, guy!"
9,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,What?
10,18,6,Butters Stotch,"Congratulations, Kyle."
11,18,6,Announcer,"[pops up again] With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada. [only five buildings, all houses, are shown, with the rest of the area being undeveloped] Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk! [a Royal Bank price chart appears, with purchases going from 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents to 5700 for $50] How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?"
12,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,This is stupid!
13,18,6,Butters Stotch,"Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. [Kyle taps on the button and coins pop out at him]"
14,18,6,Announcer,You buy 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents! You're amazing! Now use that Canadough to help rebuild Canada! Click to build a hospital here. [a floating red arrow pops up on the empty block across from Terrance & Phillip's house. Kyle taps on it and the hospital appears]
15,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Yaaay!
16,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
17,18,6,Eric Cartman,[approaching wit Kenny] What are you two boners doing?
18,18,6,Butters Stotch,We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
19,18,6,Eric Cartman,I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
20,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Who makes this crap?
21,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!"
22,18,6,Prince,Where is the roof on this thing?
23,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,[the double doors burst open and Terrance & Phillip storm their way in] What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
24,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?"
25,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
26,18,6,Prince,"Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming."
27,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.
28,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,It's the dumbest game ever! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
29,18,6,Prince,"Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!"
30,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!"
31,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),[low voice] They see through the charade.
32,18,6,Prince,"Uh oh, you think so?"
33,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"I think they see through the charade, yes."
34,18,6,Prince,"I'm pretty sure they can hear us too. [Yes, and they're not pleased one bit.]"
35,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up! [walks up to a large heavy rope and pulls on it. A bell sounds and the curtain around the room go up, revealing white boards that show how the mobile game is set up. Terrance & Phillip are suddenly bewildered] Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years, gaming was simple: you pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps, we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you pay for incentives, you're rewarded!"
36,18,6,Prince,"Free""mium"". The ""mium"" is Latin for ""not really."""
37,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"It's a simple cycle, a never-ending loop based on RPGs: Explore -> Collect -> Spend -> Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money."
38,18,6,Prince,It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun!
39,18,6,Randy Marsh,"You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! [whips out a phone bill. Sharon's arms are crossed]"
40,18,6,Stan Marsh,I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much.
41,18,6,Randy Marsh,"You didn't realize! What are ""Canadian coins""?"
42,18,6,Stan Marsh,You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
43,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!"
44,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I'll pay you back for it, okay?!"
45,18,6,Randy Marsh,How?!
46,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ!"
47,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter! [Sharon lies down] I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa."
48,18,6,Sharon Marsh,Wull whattaya mean?
49,18,6,Randy Marsh,[faces Sharon] Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
50,18,6,Sharon Marsh,Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
51,18,6,Randy Marsh,"I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.[dramatic exit music]"
52,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles: entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-"
53,18,6,Prince,So they'll forget they're spending money.
54,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),-and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.
55,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?"
56,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun. [the Prince gives Terrance and Phillip each a check.]"
57,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,What's this?
58,18,6,Prince,Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.
59,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,So this is- Everyone is doing this?
60,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),Ehhhveryone is doing it.
61,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,It's just the way things are going?
62,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),It's the way things are going!
63,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad."
64,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"[in the game] Hey Phillip! [Stan's bedroom door opens and in walk Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman]"
65,18,6,Stan Marsh,Ohhh hey guys.
66,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You... missed school today?
67,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best."
68,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
69,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?"
70,18,6,Eric Cartman,"How much money did you micropay today, Stan?"
71,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. [smiles]"
72,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
73,18,6,Stan Marsh,"You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?"
74,18,6,Eric Cartman,Yes.
75,18,6,Stan Marsh,"It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out."
76,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?"
77,18,6,Eric Cartman,Jimmy told me about this game.
78,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, who told you about this game?"
79,18,6,Kenny McCormick,(Jimmy.)
80,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what?!"
81,18,6,Eric Cartman,The?!
82,18,6,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck?!)
83,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here. [a boy crosses the street and stands next to him] Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?"
84,18,6,Boy,What do you mean?
85,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,The Terrance & Phillip mobile game. [whips it out] All the cool kids are usin' it.
86,18,6,Boy,"Aw, I don't know."
87,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff. [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny appear at the other end of the block and spot him, then walk towards him a few seconds later] It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? [the boys reach him]"
88,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?"
89,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Why sure fellas. [the boy turns left and walks away] Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid."
90,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to him] Dude, what are you doing?!"
91,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
92,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You need to stop recommending that app to people!
93,18,6,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
94,18,6,Eric Cartman,Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
95,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all."
96,18,6,Eric Cartman,It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
97,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[crosses his arms] Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!"
98,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"[on the spot] Alright, alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff."
99,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You just push it on other people?!
100,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,They pay me to!
101,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!"
102,18,6,Prince,"You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game."
103,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing."
104,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),Oh. Ah what is the matter?
105,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. [Terrance jumps up and farts on Phillip, who laughs.]"
106,18,6,Prince,"But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan."
107,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
108,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that! [gasps] Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in ""moderation""?"
109,18,6,Prince,Ohhhhh. [claps furiously]
110,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Do you really think that would help?
111,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!
112,18,6,Announcer,"You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK! [screen goes black with ""Drink Responsibly"" in white on it] Please drink responsibly."
113,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go. [Stan catches up] That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine. [they approach Marvin] Come on Dad, we're going home."
114,18,6,Marvin Marsh,"[playing at a 25 cent Lucky Unicorn slot machine] Ah, go away."
115,18,6,Randy Marsh,Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
116,18,6,Marvin Marsh,What are you talkin' about?
117,18,6,Randy Marsh,I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
118,18,6,Stan Marsh,It's just...
119,18,6,Marvin Marsh,It's fun.
120,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's fun."
121,18,6,Randy Marsh,It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
122,18,6,Marvin Marsh,Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
123,18,6,Randy Marsh,"I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six! [walks up to a small buffet cabinet on which sit six different glasses of wine, from syrah to rosé] It's called a tasting, and it's classy![Marvin looks away]"
124,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it."
125,18,6,Marvin Marsh,"[faces forward] Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop."
126,18,6,Randy Marsh,"All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore. [gulps down the glass of Merlot] HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*"
127,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman. [turns around and walks across the room] People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
128,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
129,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
130,18,6,Eric Cartman,[approaches Jimmy and grabs him by the shirt collar] And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
131,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"I needed the money, alright?! [Cartman releases him and he walks off a bit] I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!"
132,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You have your crutches!
133,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much."
134,18,6,Eric Cartman,That makes sense.
135,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You're saying these games do this on purpose?!
136,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,[faces the boys] Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
137,18,6,Voice Notification,"Hey, buddy. Come on, guy. [Stan turns to his left side and the notification disappears, but just as he closes his eyes another one follows.] Come back, friend. You've got new buddies, guy. [Stan takes his pillow and puts it over his head. The third notification comes in] We've just given you 5000 Canadian coins. [Stan quickly looks at his phone] Enjoy your Canadough."
138,18,6,Stan Marsh,"...Free? [puts his pillow back on the mattress, grabs the phone and starts playing again]"
139,18,6,Randy Marsh,"What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!"
140,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up."
141,18,6,Randy Marsh,"$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!"
142,18,6,Stan Marsh,One?
143,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!"
144,18,6,Stan Marsh,"No, no, it's not."
145,18,6,Randy Marsh,"You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!"
146,18,6,Stan Marsh,I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
147,18,6,Randy Marsh,"I am not chugging beer! [walks up to the breakfast table on which are eight glasses of wine and eight of beer, paired up. He's gone through four pairs already] I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! [plops the fifth lager into the fifth wine glass and chugs down the pair, then blows a whistle while shaking his head with his hands. Stan has nothing to say.]"
148,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, I need help. [sometime later Cartman, Kenny and Jimmy arrive, and Stan picks up where he left off. The conversation moves to the living room, and Kyle gives Stan a comforting tap on the right shoulder] There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand."
149,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?"
150,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Sure. Come on, guys. [he, Cartman and Kyle walk away]"
151,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic."
152,18,6,Stan Marsh,It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
153,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help."
154,18,6,Stan Marsh,How?
155,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say ""I have a problem."" And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. [Stan is left deep in thought]"
156,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[brainstorming] We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-"
157,18,6,Eric Cartman,It's done. [he had been texting on his phone]
158,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Wuh, what's done?"
159,18,6,Eric Cartman,"The word is out. [shows him the phone] ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it. [glances at his phone's screen] It's trending."
160,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
161,18,6,Prince,You what?
162,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game."
163,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
164,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!"
165,18,6,Prince,"Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?"
166,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games really work. [pulls down on the heavy rope again and new, prepared whiteboards come down over the used ones. The doors close and the room gets dim.] The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents."
167,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,But then all our profits come from people with problems.
168,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke."
169,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"[snorts the bump] Okay, but we still won't stand for this!"
170,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? [a bright, fiery light appears behind him and he turns to look at it. Satan emerges from it]"
171,18,6,Satan,You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!
172,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them."
173,18,6,Satan,"Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul! [moments later he's on Stan's bed, the fiery light gone] So you got dopamine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce."
174,18,6,Stan Marsh,Okay.
175,18,6,Satan,"But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff."
176,18,6,Stan Marsh,So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
177,18,6,Satan,"Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopamine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life."
178,18,6,Stan Marsh,So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
179,18,6,Satan,"Yeah, that's pretty much what it means."
180,18,6,Stan Marsh,The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
181,18,6,Satan,"Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?"
182,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, no, this is great."
183,18,6,Satan,"Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec."
184,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers."
185,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"Oh God, he just doesn't stop!"
186,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Who IS this guy?!
187,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're COUNTING on it!! It's the same with us, but we've got our eyes on every addict's screen! [the whiteboards begin to dissolve into the walls, with the words floating around independently]Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!"
188,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
189,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil. [he transforms into a Canadian devil and floats up towards the ceiling] I'm the Canadian Devil. [laughs]"
190,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!
191,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Beelzeboot!
192,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"You discovered my plan, but too late! [lets out a flaming turd] Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me!"
193,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Oh no!
194,18,6,Prince,"Oh, what have I done?!"
195,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),Heheheh! Hahaha! [lets out a flaming turd]
196,18,6,Satan,"So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopamine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff.[puts the whiteboard aside] Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ?"
197,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?"
198,18,6,Satan,"You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too, so people have free will and all that shit. But ,you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay."
199,18,6,Voice Notification,"*Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?"
200,18,6,Satan,What's this?
201,18,6,Stan Marsh,"That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. [Satan taps the screen, stands up, and plays the game]"
202,18,6,Satan,"What, you just collect coins?"
203,18,6,Announcer,How much money can you buy today?
204,18,6,Satan,"No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?"
205,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Ah, Canada?"
206,18,6,Satan,"Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, ""temptation has to be nuanced!"" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?"
207,18,6,Stan Marsh,...Okay. [Satan proceeds to possess Stan] Aaaaahhh!
208,18,6,Randy Marsh,Oh pass interference! Interference! [points at the TV. Stan walks by]
209,18,6,Sharon Marsh,"Stan, where are you going? [Randy looks over]"
210,18,6,Stan Marsh,[with Satan's voice] I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. [continues out the door]
211,18,6,Randy Marsh,Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. [Sharon looks at him]
212,18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil."
213,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"[flies up to the microphone] Hey, guy, I'm the Canadian Devil. [lets out a flaming turd and flies back into the Department]"
214,18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world. [Beelzeboot goes to torture Terrance, Phillip, and the Prince, who now hang from chains tied to the ceiling]"
215,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Heh heheheh, I stab you. [Satan, now in Stan's body, appears outside the meeting room and blows the doors off, then walks in]"
216,18,6,Satan,Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!
217,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Who the fuck is that?
218,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan! [lets out a flaming turd]"
219,18,6,Satan,"Return from whence you came! [purple balls of energy appear around his hands, and they produce two beams of flame which carry Beelzeboot out into the sky]"
220,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Ow! Watch it, guy! [the battle continues in the sky]"
221,18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton. [The Canadian Minister of Sports appears on split screen]"
222,18,6,Minister of Sports,"Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years."
223,18,6,Canadian,"Screw that, go Canada!"
224,18,6,Satan,"Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come. [the balls of energy reappear and this time he aims the flames down at Beelzeboot. He destroys the Department in the meantime. Flaming skulls appear and go back into the pit Satan created]"
225,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hey dude.
226,18,6,Stan Marsh,Hey.
227,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Y-you alright?
228,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. [turns away and walks off the court]"
229,18,6,Eric Cartman,Cool.
230,18,6,Prince,"My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, shitty tundra. [cheers erupt from the crowd]"
231,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie."
232,18,6,Marvin Marsh,"Well okay, good idea. [Stan rolls the dice]"
233,18,6,Randy Marsh,[stops by with an ornate silver cup] What are you gaywads doin'?
234,18,6,Stan Marsh,"We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps."
235,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. [takes a seat]"
236,18,6,Stan Marsh,"That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking."
237,18,6,Randy Marsh,"It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse."
238,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. [Marvin takes the dice and rolls them]"
239,18,6,Randy Marsh,You guys wanna put some money on it? [Stan bangs his head on the table.]
