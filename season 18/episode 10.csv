0,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
[leaves the menorah and stops by Ike's room, and looks in]
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.

[Ike is watching ""Call of Duty"" on his computer]"
1,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up on screen] Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!"
2,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
[Kyle looks at the floor, turns back and walks away. he stops by the kitchen, then by his dad's study. Gerald takes a selfie with his pet project: a model of a ship]
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.

[he walks through the living room, then stops and looks around]
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,

[he looks at the TV and walks up to it]
What brought families together most was a good old TV

[he walks through the park with his head down]
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.

[he sees a little girl on a bench looking at her iPhone]
And if you try to complain, you get called a-"
3,18,10,Girl on Park Bench,Grandpa!
4,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,I'm NOT a GRANDPA!

6,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Whattaya think?
7,18,10,Butters Stotch,"Hmmm, it's kind of gay."
8,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Really??
9,18,10,Butters Stotch,"I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?"
10,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome."""
11,18,10,Butters Stotch,"Well, gay is wholesome."
12,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values."
13,18,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[knocks, then enters] Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you."

21,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,We?
22,18,10,Bill Cosby,"I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend. [notices how dusty the TV is and wipes some of the dust off with his right hand] It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now."
23,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. [smiles] Well that's awesome!
24,18,10,Bill Cosby,Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
25,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"M-Ah, I'd love to."
26,18,10,Bill Cosby,Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!

31,18,10,Det Harris,"Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?"
32,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it."
33,18,10,Officer 1,[with mustache] Who's the famous artist?
34,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde."
35,18,10,Det Harris,You're Lorde.
36,18,10,Sharon Marsh,"The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him."
37,18,10,Officer 1,You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
38,18,10,Randy Marsh,No! That was a copy of me!
39,18,10,Officer 2,Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh! [bemused smile which quickly fades.]
40,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!"
41,18,10,Officer 3,[runs into the station] Detective Harris! Sir! We've got a problem!
42,18,10,Det Harris,"[turns around] What is it, Adams?"
43,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams",[Officer 3] We've arrested a black man who was snooping around the old Jefferson estate!

49,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams","He... appears to be just a hologram, sir."
50,18,10,MJ s Hologram,"[brought in by another officer, somehow handcuffed] Naw, it's ignorant! You don't understand! We have to stop them! Heee hee!"
51,18,10,Det Harris,Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
52,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[excitedly] Dude, what are you doing?!"
53,18,10,Stan Marsh,[texting] Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
54,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!"
55,18,10,Stan Marsh,Who did?
56,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"These producers making a big holiday special! [goes to the TV and wipes it clean] They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!"
57,18,10,Stan Marsh,"That's a little strange, isn't it?"
58,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!"
59,18,10,Announcer,"From the producers of Women Of Rock Live and The Rockefeller Tree Lighting Ceremony, it's the holiday television event of the season!

64,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room."
65,18,10,Eric Cartman,He's such a douchebag.
66,18,10,Announcer,It's all live and it's all magical. It's the Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special.
67,18,10,Eric Cartman,Now we're talkin'! [the commenter window disappears and Stan and Kyle are stunned]
68,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,That son of a bitch!
69,18,10,Stan Marsh,That self-promoting asshole!
70,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Why would he do this?!
71,18,10,Stan Marsh,Because my dad's an idiot!
72,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!"
73,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Nnnothing, nothing."
74,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. [eats some chips]"
75,18,10,Exec 1,"So far the holiday special is trending fine, but it appears that the Michael Jackson hologram is the most heavily tweeted."
76,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,And we still have no idea where the damned hologram is?
77,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down."
78,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut."
79,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"We got one shot at this, people! This [pounds his fist on the table] has to be the holiday special to end all holiday specials!"
80,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??"
81,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,He's got his finger on the pulse of young America.
82,18,10,Exec 2,"Sir, I'm pretty sure that [reads from his phone] ""Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special"" is not a good name."
83,18,10,Eric Cartman,"No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!"
84,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"[leans in] If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power!"
85,18,10,Eric Cartman,"I can hear you, douchebag."
86,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"People, you know what we're trying to do here. [leaves his desk and paces the room] We're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. That means being hip, being now."
87,18,10,Eric Cartman,These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
88,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"There, you see that? ""Blumpkin catchers."" Do any of you even know what that means? This kid is our way to connect with the youth of America, and I'm gonna give him all the power he needs."
89,18,10,Eric Cartman,G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
90,18,10,Officer 4,"What about this, sir? Burnt sienna?"
91,18,10,Det Harris,"He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!"
92,18,10,Officer 1,"I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown."
93,18,10,Det Harris,That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
94,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde."
95,18,10,MJ s hologram,"Who? Lorde? You're not Lorde, that's ignorant."
96,18,10,Randy Marsh,Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
97,18,10,MJ s hologram,They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant! It's gonna be the most ignorant holiday special ever!
98,18,10,Randy Marsh,A holiday special. Oh my God.
99,18,10,MJ s hologram,It's directed at children! We have to stop them!
100,18,10,Officer 4,Huh how about we say he's mixed race?
101,18,10,Det Harris,"As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay."
102,18,10,Randy Marsh,[to Sharon] I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special! [to MJ's hologram] Can you help me stop them?!
103,18,10,MJ s hologram,Yes. We have to reach the children. It's our only hope.
104,18,10,Randy Marsh,Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
105,18,10,MJ s hologram,[stands up] ALLEGEDLY! [the officers look at him] THAT WAS A CIVIL SUIT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE! [sits down] It's ignorant.
106,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Mom?! Where is Ike?!
107,18,10,Sheila Broflovski,Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
108,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
109,18,10,Sheila Broflovski,He's upstairs playing with all his friends.
110,18,10,PewDiePie,"Oh my God, that's the ugliest..."
111,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!"
112,18,10,Kid 2,Old people are so funny.
113,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner",They really just don't get it.
114,18,10,Kid 3,And they smell like soap.
115,18,10,Stan Marsh,"We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!"
116,18,10,Kid 4,"Careful Grandpa, you might crap your Depends! [the kids laugh, even Ike]"
117,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
118,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you damn kids!"
119,18,10,PewDiePie,...that's the lamest...
120,18,10,Det Harris,"Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?"
121,18,10,Front Desk Officer,Can I help you? [the hologram looks at him and moves away] Eh-excuse me. Can I help you? [the hologram moves deeper into the building. A security camera shows him walking down a hallway. The front desk officer runs into the office] Sir? A black guy walked into the police station!
122,18,10,Det Harris,"Heh, uh huh? [looks at the officer and grins]"
123,18,10,Front Desk Officer,"Well a, a black guy walked into the police station."
124,18,10,Det Harris,"[chuckling, anticipating a joke] Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one. [Mitchell appears in the background] Start over: what's the setup?"
125,18,10,Front Desk Officer,"There's this black guy, walked into the police station."
126,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams","Oh yeah, I think I've heard it, but go ahead."
127,18,10,Front Desk Officer,"No, really, a black guy walked into the-!"
128,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams","Ohhh ya ya ya? ""We set who free?"""
129,18,10,Front Desk Officer,"No no, a black guy literally walked into the police station!"
130,18,10,Det Harris,"Oh, it's a new one. [Tupac's hologram walks in] Aw, shit! Look out! [the officers quickly draw their weapons]"
131,18,10,Officer 4,It's a black guy! Choke him!
132,18,10,Det Harris,Shoot him!
133,18,10,Officer 4,"Shoot him and then choke him! [the front desk officer shoots the hologram, but the bullet just goes through and disrupts the hologram's structural integrity. The officer tries to choke the hologram, but the arms just go through it]"
134,18,10,MJ s hologram,He's here to kill us! Run!! Heee heee! [they escape while the officers shoot at Tupac's hologram. They go down the fire escape unnoticed]
135,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, open this door right now!"
136,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up] Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!"
137,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing?!
138,18,10,Eric Cartman,"What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible."
139,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
140,18,10,Eric Cartman,How do you even know I'm here in my room?
141,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Because you just said, ""here in my room""!"
142,18,10,Eric Cartman,"...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions. [Kyle tries breaking his way into the room] You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. [Kyle stops]"
143,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!"
144,18,10,Eric Cartman,Why does that matter?
145,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Because Lorde is my dad, alright?! [walks forward as his anger drains away] Lorde is my dad."
146,18,10,Eric Cartman,What?
147,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you talking about, Stan?"
148,18,10,Stan Marsh,He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
149,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. [the commenter window disappears]"
150,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped."
151,18,10,Stan Marsh,It just all seemed so... stupid.
152,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
153,18,10,Sharon Marsh,See if it started!
154,18,10,Randy Marsh,"We don't really use this thing anymore. [grabs the remote and turns on the TV] It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!"
155,18,10,Sharon Marsh,"[puts her hand on Randy's shoulder] Randy, what about Shelly?"
156,18,10,Randy Marsh,Oh my God...
157,18,10,MJ s hologram,Shelly? Who's Shelly? That's ignorant.
158,18,10,Randy Marsh,My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
159,18,10,Sharon Marsh,How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
160,18,10,Randy Marsh,I guess... one step at a time.
161,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Shelly? Um, I'm Lorde. [she sits up a little] All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. [blows her a kiss and closes the door, then to Michael's hologram]Whew, that was hard."
162,18,10,Sharon Marsh,RANDY?! [Randy and Michael's hologram head downstairs[
163,18,10,Sharon Marsh,It's started.
164,18,10,Announcer,"And now, Nabisco and Dolly Madison present, The Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special! [CartmanBrah appears in a window at upper left of the screen]"
165,18,10,Announcer,"And now, live via hologram, it's Kurt Cobain. [he appears in a Christmas fireplace setting]"
166,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, this should be good."
167,18,10,Kurt s hologram,"[begins to sing]
Up on the housetop, reindeer pawsOut jumps good ole Santa Claus"
168,18,10,Eric Cartman,I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
169,18,10,Kurt s hologram,"Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, girls and boys [reaches to his left for a rifle and waves it around as if marching]
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go
Yeh-he-he-eah who wouldn't go [loads and cocks the rifle]
Up on the housetop clickity click click [aims it at his mouth as if to shoot himself]
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick? [waves it around again, then stops]"
170,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Hoh, this should get some comments. [Kurt's hologram fires the rifle and a small flag saying ""Merry Christmas"" pops out. He grins]"
171,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,Stand by on camera 4. Boost the live Twitter feed. Aaand cue the hash tag! How are we trending?
172,18,10,Controller 1,Trending at 64% and steady.

174,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,Excellent. I'm just about to deal with our last order of business now.
175,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks into the restaurant and towards the producer with Stan] Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad."
176,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"No no, thank you! [wipes his lips clean] If you hadn't called, I... wouldn't know what I know now. [gets up and walks towards the bar, dialing a number in the process]"
177,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again."
178,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,It's me. I've got somethin' you might be interested in.
179,18,10,Randy Marsh,"[on the line in the master bedroom] I don't think so, you son of a bitch! [Sharon and Michael's hologram are also there]"
180,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"I've got your son here, Lorde. If you don't cooperate, he dies."
181,18,10,Stan Marsh,What?? [both he and Kyle are scared]
182,18,10,Randy Marsh,Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!
183,18,10,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, where are you going?!"
184,18,10,Randy Marsh,"THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON! [just as he reaches the front door, it opens and Tupac's hologram walks in] SHIT!! [runs to the back door.]"
185,18,10,Det Harris,"[on his bullhorn] All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!"
186,18,10,Officer 5,"[runs up] Sir! You'd better see this! [holds out a phone, which Detective Harris looks at] There's something new trending! #copscantgoaroundchokingblackpeople."

188,18,10,Officer 6,"No, sir, I I think they mean we shouldn't. Like we're racist or something."
189,18,10,Det Harris,What?! We're not racists.
190,18,10,Peterson,"Sir, we've got confirmation. There's two black guys in the upstairs of the house!"
191,18,10,Det Harris,"[turns around anticipating another joke] Uh huh, go ahead."

203,18,10,Controller 1,We're barely trending at all. But #ihatecartmanbrah is trending off the charts!
204,18,10,Controller 2,He's right. ihatecartmanbrah is trending at 96% and climbing.
205,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,That's impossible.
206,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
207,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"It was five years ago that I... became a grandpa. At first it was wonderful. I wanted to show my grandson everything. Teach him all about the entertainment business. One day I aasked him, ""Who's your favorite celebrity?"" You know what he said to me? He said, ""PeewwDiePie."" I had no idea who [turns around] he was talking about. So I looked it up. And he was this insignificant little game blogger from Sweden who my grandson thought was a god! No matter who else I tried to impress him with, he would just say, ""Meh."" To me! MEH! [turns back to the bar] What the hell is wrong with these kids today?? With this special, we will assimilate this generation's culture into ours! MAKE THEM APPRECIATE REAL ENTERTAINMENT, DAMNIT! [pounds theh bar with his fist]"
208,18,10,Stan Marsh,Dude. You're such a grandpa.
209,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,[angrily clears everything off the bar] I AM NOT A GRANDPAAA!
210,18,10,Taylor Swift,Well I guess it's time to leave.
211,18,10,Bill s hologram,Oh but it's snowin' out dere.
212,18,10,Taylor Swift,Yeah but I need to get home.
213,18,10,Bill s hologram,But it's snowin' out dere.
214,18,10,Taylor Swift,I really should go
215,18,10,Bill s hologram,Oh what's the hurry?
216,18,10,Taylor Swift,"Say, what's in this drink?"
217,18,10,Bill s hologram,That's just some J-E-L-L-O.
218,18,10,Taylor Swift,The holidays are comin'-
219,18,10,Dad and Mom,This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen.
220,18,10,Dad and Mom,Maybe we should turn it off.
221,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Oh wow, where are we now, brahs? [the family looks at him] This looks pretty stupid."
222,18,10,Dad and Mom,"What the heck? [tries to turn the TV off, but it won't turn off]"
223,18,10,Eric Cartman,CartmaanBrah!
224,18,10,Dad and Mom,[smacks the remote on his left hand a few times] This damn TV! What is that window doing outside the holiday special?! [tries turning the TV off again]
225,18,10,Dad and Mom,Call customer service.
226,18,10,Steve from Customer Service,Panasonic customer service. How can I help you?
227,18,10,Dad and Mom,"Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that?"
228,18,10,Steve from Customer Service,Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?
229,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!"
230,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,This isn't part of the holiday special! What is he doing?!
231,18,10,Controller 2,He's trending more than we ever thought possible.!
232,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful."
233,18,10,Det Harris,"[laughing with them] Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead."
234,18,10,Peterson,"So, then, the first black guy said to the second black guy, ""Don't shoot me. I'm on your side."""
235,18,10,Det Harris,"Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on. [catches his breath] Okay, go ahead."
236,18,10,Peterson,"And then the, the the tattooed black guy said, to him, ""I ain't gonna kill you, man. You're the King of Pop. Let's go cap that whitey producer."""
237,18,10,Det Harris,Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!
238,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Happy holidays, everyone! [the cops stop laughing and look at the window] Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah."
239,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"Damn it, you're ruining the show!"
240,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah."
241,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,I am so confused.
242,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,[to Ron] Shut him down!'
243,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"We can't, sir!"
244,18,10,Eric Cartman,"I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool."
245,18,10,Stephen Stotch,I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?
246,18,10,Eric Cartman,"It's all CartmanBrah now. [a shot of Times Square. Cartman's image replaces everything else on the screens there] I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender. [a shot of the Times Square crowd, looking at the screens in disbelief] Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!"
247,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"This is not what I hired you for! I CONTROL TALENT, DAMNIT!"
248,18,10,MJ s hologram,[bursts through the doors with Tupac's hologram] There he is! That's the ignorant man!
249,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,This is crazy and everyone is watching everything!
250,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinking aloud] Everyone is watching everything. [turns right and walks up to a camera] Ike? [switch to Ike's room] Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa. [Ike's friends look at the monitor] I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did. [Michael's hologram walks up to the record producer and shoots him in the head, killing him] I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again."
251,18,10,Kid 4,"Oh, I feel bad for the little guy."
252,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner",There's nothing sadder than a old man crying.
253,18,10,Kid 3,Maybe we should help
254,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner",Yeah!
255,18,10,Kid 2,Okay.
256,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Help? How can you help?
257,18,10,Kid 2,It's the holiday season. We just need to get everyone to believe again.
258,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner","Yeah, someone can come change all this. You know who."
259,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Really? That's what you guys would do?
260,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner",Of course! We just need to get everyone to believe in him. He'll always come and help. #webelieveinyou
261,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!"
262,18,10,MJ s hologram,We believe in you. Of course!
263,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,[walks ever closer to the camera] You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! [the signal is now disrupted]
264,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey! What's going on? What is that? [amid some special effects of snow and holly popping out of the upper right corner of screens everywhere, PewDiePie's commenter window appears]"
265,18,10,PewDiePie,How's it goin' bros? This is [goes fullscreen]PewDiePie!
266,18,10,Eric Cartman,What the hell?!
267,18,10,Kids,PewDiePie!
268,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,PewDiePie?!
269,18,10,PewDiePie,"Thanks for all the shoutouts. I guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out."
270,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!"
271,18,10,PewDiePie,"[mocking Cartman] God damn it, get out of here!"
272,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!"
273,18,10,PewDiePie,"This show is getting kind of boring, bros. What do you say we change it out to something more exciting?"
274,18,10,Eric Cartman,Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
275,18,10,PewDiePie,I know! Let's play Call of Duty! [the game pops up fullscreen and the commenter windows switch places]
276,18,10,Eric Cartman,No! You can't do this!
277,18,10,PewDiePie,"Ohhh yeah! This is more like it, bros!"
278,18,10,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!"
279,18,10,PewDiePie,"Okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. Let's get rid of him!"
280,18,10,Eric Cartman,"NOOOO! [his commenter window disappears, as well as the holiday special]"
281,18,10,PewDiePie,"Oh yeah! Way better, bros! This is how we do it in Sweden! BOOM head shot! BOOM head shot!"
282,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night."
283,18,10,Stan Marsh,"I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about."
284,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats."
285,18,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
286,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here. [notices PewDiePie's commenter window pop up to his right and above] And I, think that's great."
287,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I think that's great too."
288,18,10,PewDiePie,"Alright bros, it look like we'll have to end it there. I wanna thank South Park for being in my show. I hope you bros enjoyed watching, and as always, stay awesome!"
