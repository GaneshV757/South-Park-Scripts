0,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,[voice over] You have been very very naughty! [a shot of Kyle's parents having sex in bed] You're a naughty girl! [begins to grunt with every thrust]
1,13,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty! [joins in the grunting for a few seconds] Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! [their bedroom door opens]"
2,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[quickly turns around and faces the door] What the?! ...Ike! [Ike is at the bedroom entrance looking scared. He's dragging a puppy plushie around] Ike, get back to bed right now!"
3,13,8,Ike Broflovski,I'm scared. There's a ghost.
4,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, not this again. [angrily] Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!"
5,13,8,Ike Broflovski,But Daddy I saw the-
6,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,"No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! [Ike turns left and walks out of view, his head hanging]"
7,13,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, what has gotten into him?"
8,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[sighing] Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he just freaked himself out."
9,13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for Megascrub Cleanser."
10,13,8,Ike Broflovski,AAAAAAAAA!
11,13,8,Billy Mays,"Are you tired of your kitchen counters getting those nasty stains? Don't just rub 'em, Megascrub 'em!"
12,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"Billy Mays, NO! [jumps out of bed and runs into his closet. The camera pans out...]"
13,13,8,Billy Mays,"[...and Billy is in the closet too] Mold, mildew, even those impossible wine stains are gone in a flash when you snipe them away."
14,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"[runs out of the closet, through his room, and into the hallway.] MMOOMMMYYY! [runs towards the stairs and passes another room. Another celebrity appears in the entrance] AAAAAA! Farrah Fawcett! Farrah Fawcett! [runs to a door opposite the room and opens it. A man appears hanging from the ceiling in that room, wearing fishnet stockings] AAAAAA! David Carradine! [runs away from that room and heads for the stairs, but stops in his tracks and gasps]"
15,13,8,Billy Mays,"[walking up the stairs] Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Mend It, the fast and easy way to mend, hem, and wear it again. [Ike backs away towards his room]"
16,13,8,Ike Broflovski,NOOOOO!
17,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[comes out of his room] Ike! Ike, what?!"
18,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away! [Kyle looks, but nothing is there] Make him stop! [buries his face in Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him] Make him stop, Kyle!"
19,13,8,Dr Land,"Now Ike, your family is very worried about you. Ike, you can talk to me. I'm a therapist. Whatever has been troubling you, it's okay."
20,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"No, it's... it's a secret."
21,13,8,Dr Land,"Ike, tell me your secret. I promise not to tell anyone else."
22,13,8,Ike Broflovski,[turns his head to the right to look at the doctor] I see dead... ce-le-bri-ties.
23,13,8,Dr Land,"You mean, you see dead celebrities on TV? In the news?"
24,13,8,Ike Broflovski,I see them walking around. They talk to me.
25,13,8,Dr Land,Are you seeing any dead celebrities right now?
26,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"Just Ed McMahon. [Ed McMahon's ghost looks at Ike over Dr. Land's right shoulder, then turns right and walks off]"
27,13,8,Dr Land,How often do you see dead celebrities?
28,13,8,Ike Broflovski,All the time. [blinks a few times]
29,13,8,Eric Cartman,"'Sup, Jew?"
30,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities."
31,13,8,Eric Cartman,HA! What a dumbass! [Kenny mumbles a question]
32,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again."
33,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Billy Mays? Billy Mays?! [hops off the sofa] Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!"
34,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
35,13,8,Eric Cartman,Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
36,13,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't even know who that is."
37,13,8,Eric Cartman,"The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here! [quickly flips through the channels until a Billy Mays commercial appears] Here here! This, this is him!"
38,13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle [shows off two Chipotle burritos], but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear [shows off bloodstained underwear]."
39,13,8,Man 1,[holding a burrito in his right hand] I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. [a shriek is added for emphasis]
40,13,8,Billy Mays,"[now near a washer and dryer] Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear. Chipotl-away. [shows off the bottle, which says Chipotlaway. What follows is a demonstration of how the product works] Just one Chipotle burrito [shown] can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood [a quarter cup of red liquid is poured onto the briefs], but Chipotl-away [a couple of squirts of it makes the liquid vanish] makes your underwear clean [a towel is used to remove the liquid and product] and ready for more. [a man is shown stocking up on briefs, but they slip from his arms] Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle. That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new. [a pair of black hands smooths some briefs out over a table, then puts the Chipotle burrito on it] Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it."
41,13,8,Man 2,"[leans down towards the burrito and smiles at the camera] Mmm, Chipotle. [gives a thumbs up and begins to eat off his underwear]"
42,13,8,Billy Mays,"Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want [two women eat burritos on a park bench.], and still have underwear that sparkles and shines [one of the women holds up a pair of clean panties, which sparkle and shine]. Order right now!"
43,13,8,Eric Cartman,That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
44,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?! Are you serious?!
45,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can."
46,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!"
47,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Because he was a great person, Kyle."
48,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!"
49,13,8,Eric Cartman,"...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call..."
50,13,8,Announcer,"On this episode of Ghost Hunters [a cemetery is shown]: a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities. [a shot of Ike floating across the screen, with various backdrops behind him] Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!"
51,13,8,Jason,"Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris."
52,13,8,Kris,We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-
53,13,8,Jason,"Wait, what? What was that? What was that?"
54,13,8,Grant,"I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*"
55,13,8,Jason,Is there a ghost here?
56,13,8,Jason,"Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?"
57,13,8,Kris,"Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them."
58,13,8,Jason,"Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?"
59,13,8,Grant,I think that's just a cigarette lighter.
60,13,8,Jason,"Oh, right, okay. May be."
61,13,8,Jason,We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that?
62,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,What was what?
63,13,8,Jason,Did you hear that? It was like a... it was like a... dee.. Is there a spooky ghost here?? Uh LOOK. What is that? What is that?? [a shot of the Broflovskis living room TV]
64,13,8,Grant,I'm pretty sure that's their television.
65,13,8,Jason,"Oh man I am really scared. [looks at his groin. Grant's flashlight and the camera quickly aim at it] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What is this? What is this? There's a, there's a, a wetness coming from my pants! [he peed his pants]"
66,13,8,Grant,I see it!
67,13,8,Jason,W... what is it?!
68,13,8,Grant,Oh God I'm so scared! [begins to whimper] I'm so scared.
69,13,8,Jason,"Look! Look, it's got you too! [points to Grant's groin, then says to the cameraman] Are you getting this? Make sure the camera is getting this. Definitely some paranormal activity!"
70,13,8,Grant,"It's warm, and moist. A warm moist sensation that's moving down my left thigh. [the urine reaches the floor and starts spreading out]"
71,13,8,Jason,"Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??"
72,13,8,Stan Marsh,Are you guys fucking serious?
73,13,8,Jason,"Oh God, the paranormal activity is now leaving a, a trail of some kind behind both of us! [such melodrama!]"
74,13,8,Grant,"Hoh! Something... hot, and and, warm is coming out the back of my pants now. [Well...]"
75,13,8,Jason,Oh it smells!
76,13,8,"TAPS (Jason, Grant, Kris, and another member)",AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
77,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
78,13,8,Billy Mays,"[his ghost suddenly appears with a new pitch] Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station."
79,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's all just in your head, Ike."
80,13,8,Billy Mays,The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders
81,13,8,Ike Broflovski,AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!! [the other boys look at each other]
82,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,I just... don't understand it.
83,13,8,Stan Marsh,"It's gonna be alright, Kyle."
84,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?"
85,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter."
86,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear. [to Stan] Do you understand this?"
87,13,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood."
88,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway."
89,13,8,Dr Carroll,"Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma."
90,13,8,Stan Marsh,"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?"
91,13,8,Dr Carroll,"Well of course there really are ghosts. Haven't you seen that show Ghost Hunters? But I'm a pediatric doctor, so I'm going to hand this off to Dr. Phillips, who specializes in spooky things. [Dr. Phillips, a female, walks in and addresses the boys]"
92,13,8,Dr Phillips,"The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it. [Stan and Kyle look at each other as Dr. Carroll walks away] I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory."
93,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,Purgatory? What's that?
94,13,8,Dr Phillips,"[steps closer to the boys] Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called ""purgatory."" It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo."
95,13,8,Eric Cartman,[concerned] Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
96,13,8,Dr Phillips,"I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known. [the needles on an Ectograph 500 begin to move back and forth, producing some readings]"
97,13,8,Billy Mays,"[only his voice is heard] Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product."
98,13,8,Eric Cartman,Billy Mays! [makes his way to the front of the group] It's him!
99,13,8,Billy Mays,Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?

152,13,8,Eric Cartman,[rolls his eyes up in thought] Was I alarmed? [closes his eyes] Yes. [opens them and looks at Kyle] I believe I was.
153,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
154,13,8,Eric Cartman,"[correcting him] Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. [Kyle's jaw drops in alarm]"
155,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
156,13,8,Eric Cartman,Yes!
157,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?"
158,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal! [Kyle puts his hands down below the table] People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! [points to Stan]"
159,13,8,Stan Marsh,Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
160,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
