0,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Do I really have to do this, Dad?"
1,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money."
2,13,3,Stan Marsh,But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
3,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Okay, next please."
4,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Go on, Stanley. [Stan walks up to the teller's desk and takes a seat.]"
5,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"How can I help you, young man?"
6,13,3,Stan Marsh,"I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years."
7,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone. [they look at each other for a long time]"
8,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, what?"
9,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,It's gone. It's all gone.
10,13,3,Stan Marsh,What's all gone?
11,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone."
12,13,3,Stan Marsh,What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
13,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,Not anymore you don't. POOF.
14,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Well, what can I do to get back my money-?"
15,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only."
16,13,3,Stan Marsh,I just opened an account.
17,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,Do you have any money invested in this bank?
18,13,3,Stan Marsh,"No, you just lost it all!"
19,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. [an elderly woman steps up and bumps Stan out of the chair.]
20,13,3,Stan Marsh,Hey!
21,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Hello Mrs. Farnickle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone."
22,13,3,Elderly Woman,What?
23,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please."
24,13,3,Stan Marsh,Dad!
25,13,3,Randy Marsh,Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
26,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son's-- aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only. Please step aside! [both Randy and Stan are dumbstruck.]"
27,13,3,Announcer,This is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL
28,13,3,Anchor,"An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt."
29,13,3,Mr Garrison,"[in front of a convenience store] It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished."
30,13,3,Stephen Stotch,[in front of the Stotch home] It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!
31,13,3,Butters Stotch,"[waves to the camera, but his face is blocked by the 9 News logo] Hi, Grandma!"
32,13,3,Darryl Weathers and Automotive Workers,"First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!"
33,13,3,Worker 1,They took our jobs!
34,13,3,Worker 2,[shrieking] Derk er derrrrrr!
35,13,3,Worker 3,Deeekerrdrrr
36,13,3,Worker 4,Deeerkerrrrrrdrrrr
37,13,3,Anchor,"Just how far will the economy fall? We asked economic reporter Dan Banks for his assessment. [a shot of Dan, who raises a gun to his head and fires, shooting his brains out and falling out of view.] We'll have the rest of Dan's interview tonight at 10."
38,13,3,Sharon Marsh,"All right everyone, eat up. [takes her seat]"
39,13,3,Randy Marsh,Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
40,13,3,Sharon Marsh,You said we had to be careful with our money. I've got nothing for a food budget.
41,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?"
42,13,3,Randy Marsh,"[grabs a hot dog from the platter] I'll tell you what happened, son. See, there's a bunch of idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had. [slaps the hot dog onto his own plate] They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need-- [grabs his margarita glass and rises from the table] people with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying. [walks over to a Margaritaville margarita blender and loads it with ice. A margarita mix is already in place in the blender] And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing, [puts the ice scooper back into the ice bucket] 'cause they thought money was endless! [starts up the blender, which drowns out whatever he says for the next nine seconds] It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans, [the blender stops] meaning less money coming in. [serves himself a margarita and places the blender back on its base] And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry. [goes back to his seat with his margarita] We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? [sips from his margarita glass]"
43,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I think I get it."
44,13,3,Orator 1,And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy fall... As the people we must...
45,13,3,Orator 2,...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...
46,13,3,Eric Cartman,"And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft..."
47,13,3,Randy Marsh,"[dressed in a drab green toga] There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you! [starts pointing at random people] YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand dollar house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers! [speeds up his rate of pointing] Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!"
48,13,3,Man 1,He's right.
49,13,3,Man 2,This is the first guy to actually make sense. [more people are attracted to Randy's preaching]
50,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. [everyone applauds softly]"
51,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,"Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?"
52,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought."
53,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,"Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh. [Stan tries to put the receipt onto the counter, but the large Margaritaville gets in the way. Stan then just reaches up and the clerk takes the receipt] Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh."
54,13,3,Stan Marsh,What?
55,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,"I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?"
56,13,3,Stan Marsh,So?
57,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
58,13,3,Stan Marsh,Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
59,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,"[rests his head on his left hand] Hm... that's improbahbluh, [raises his left hand] but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. [Stan just looks at him]"
60,13,3,Randy Marsh,"We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head! [a shot of the Stotches in togas] Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!"
61,13,3,Gerald Broflovski,"What can we do, Randy?"
62,13,3,Man 3,Yes tell us.
63,13,3,Man 4,Tell us.
64,13,3,Man 5,Tell us what to do.
65,13,3,Man 6,"Tell us, Randy, what we should do!"
66,13,3,Man 7,"What should we do, Randy?!"
67,13,3,Randy Marsh,"We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending! [everyone begins to cheer] The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. [stretches out his arms as the audience cheers him on.]"
68,13,3,Al and Ted,[on a llama] Mornin' Ted.
69,13,3,Al and Ted,[shoveling snow off his walkway] Mornin' Al.
70,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,Well this sucks!
71,13,3,Clyde Donovan,Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
72,13,3,Eric Cartman,"[arrives and sighs] Hengh! [the squirrels run off] Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS! [stomps his left foot down] Hengh!"
73,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You want something new every week, fatass."
74,13,3,Eric Cartman,"[leaps towards him] Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!"
75,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,My fault?
76,13,3,Eric Cartman,"The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!"
77,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[jumps off his rocky perch and faces Cartman] Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!"
78,13,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, [Kyle looks back at him] why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?"
79,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?"
80,13,3,Butters Stotch,Well Eric did. [Kyle glares at Cartman again]
81,13,3,Eric Cartman,"Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle."
82,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it. [the other boys now pay attention to Kyle. Two men watch Kyle from afar.] What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family"
83,13,3,Man 8,"We best speak with the Council, and tell them.. a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy."
84,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,Can I help you?
85,13,3,Stan Marsh,I wanna return this Margaritaville.
86,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"O-kay, let me send you into Josh. [next shot is of Josh dipping his finger into a little can of Carmex and spreading it on his lips]"
87,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?"
88,13,3,Stan Marsh,"No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it."
89,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah."
90,13,3,Stan Marsh,What?
91,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm."
92,13,3,Stan Marsh,Wall Street?
93,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah."
94,13,3,Stan Marsh,So?
95,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... [Stan sighs in frustration]"
96,13,3,Stephen Stotch,"The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills."
97,13,3,Father Maxi,"You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword."
98,13,3,Randy Marsh,"I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan."
99,13,3,Skeeter,"We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online."
100,13,3,Randy Marsh,Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
101,13,3,Man 9,"Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!"
102,13,3,Randy Marsh,What?!
103,13,3,Man 9,He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!
104,13,3,Father Maxi,Spend more?! What mockery is this?!
105,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?"
106,13,3,Eric Cartman,"I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. [begins to sob, and a rowdy crowd approaches from the right]"
107,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What's that? [a crowd of men runs past them, snatching up squirrels on the way]"
108,13,3,Man 1,"'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels."
109,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,What? [the boys stand and follow the men]
110,13,3,Mr Garrison,"Now please, please! [holds his arms up in self-defense]"
111,13,3,Man 1,You have sinned!
112,13,3,Mr Garrison,"Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please."
113,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,What's going on?
114,13,3,Man 1,"Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!"
115,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,What did he do?
116,13,3,Man 11,Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!
117,13,3,Man 1,"Take that punishment, heathen! [the crowd begins stoning Garrison with squirrels]"
118,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps in between Garrison and the crowd] Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!"
119,13,3,Man 1,"Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer."
120,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, this is ridiculous!"
121,13,3,Man 1,What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!
122,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. [a man behind Principal Victoria moves and hucks a squirrel at Garrison]"
123,13,3,Mr Garrison,Oh. [the crowd gets rowdy again]
124,13,3,Stan Marsh,"'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?"
125,13,3,Stockbroker,Margaritaville?
126,13,3,Stan Marsh,My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
127,13,3,Stockbroker,"Oh, that makes sense."
128,13,3,Stan Marsh,It does?
129,13,3,Stockbroker,"You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks."
130,13,3,Stan Marsh,So I can return it to a bank?
131,13,3,Stockbroker,"Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritavilles assets from the banks."
132,13,3,Stan Marsh,What?!
133,13,3,Stockbroker,"Just talk to the Treasury Department in DC. They're the ones who really understand how all this works. [notices some activity on his stocks] Oh, sell sell sell sell sell sell sell!"
134,13,3,Stan Marsh,Aargh! [walks off with the Margaritaville]
135,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them. [pulls out an envelope] I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card. [from Kyle's position, one can see hundreds of people listening to him] It has no spending limit. [cries of shock rise from the crowd] Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money."
136,13,3,Man 11,"By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!"
137,13,3,Randy Marsh,"We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?"
138,13,3,Stephen Stotch,"Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us."
139,13,3,Father Maxi,"Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!"
140,13,3,Randy Marsh,"That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!"
141,13,3,Man 12,"Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew."
142,13,3,Father Maxi,"Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew."
143,13,3,Skeeter,I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. [a screeching sound is heard. A hand is seen going down a blackboard. and it belongs to Cartman]
144,13,3,Eric Cartman,"Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS."
145,13,3,Treasurer 1,"Uhh, how can we help you, young man?"
146,13,3,Stan Marsh,I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
147,13,3,Treasurer 1,Ohhh that makes sense.
148,13,3,Stan Marsh,Nnnaaargh!
149,13,3,Treasurer 1,No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.
150,13,3,Stan Marsh,[surprised] Really? [puts his hands together] Thank you.
151,13,3,Treasurer 1,"Be right back. [they go into a room through the heavy double doors behind them and close the doors. A squawk is heard, then a cleaver and the sound of blood spurting out. Stan is startled. The men come back out through the doors with streaks of blood on them.]"
152,13,3,Treasurer 2,"Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars."
153,13,3,Stan Marsh,What?!
154,13,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out."
155,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
156,13,3,Butters Stotch,Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
157,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. [the other boys gasp and look at Kyle. Tweek and Ike look at Clyde]"
158,13,3,Eric Cartman,"[stands up in his seat] All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool! [checks for a reaction] That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick! [clears his throat and sits down] Go ahead, Kyle."
159,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Cartman for a few seconds, then enunciates] Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith."
160,13,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic."
161,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. [looks down at his plate]"
162,13,3,Stan Marsh,Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
163,13,3,Treasurer 1,"What, you think it's worth more?"
164,13,3,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, that doesn't make sense!"
165,13,3,Treasurer 2,"Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth."
166,13,3,Treasurer 3,"[runs up to the other two treasurers] Uh oh, problem! Problem again!"
167,13,3,Treasurer 2,What is it now?
168,13,3,Treasurer 3,"Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!"
169,13,3,Treasurer 1,"Okay, no problem. [the three go behind the double doors again] We'd better consult the chart. [this time one of the doors is left ajar. Stan observes this and then takes the Margaritaville into the chart's room]"
170,13,3,Treasurer 3,"Sirs, another insurance company is going under!"
171,13,3,Sir 1,"Now determining most prudent move for insurance company. [brings down the gavel. Treasurer 2 picks up a chicken and a meat cleaver, puts the chicken down against the edge of the chart, and chops its head off with the meat cleaver. He then drops it into the chart and it stumbles around while Treasurer 3 plays the kazoo. The headless chicken drops onto the bailout button and the button lights up and sets off a bell]"
172,13,3,Treasurer 1,Bailout!
173,13,3,Treasurer 3,Most prudent move is a bailout!
174,13,3,Sir 1,"Bail out the insurance company! [Stan is upset at this method of resolving a serious economic problem. He picks up the Margaritaville, smashes it into the chart, turns around and leaves]"
175,13,3,Man 13,It's a miracle.
176,13,3,Man 14,Why would someone do this? [members of the economic recovery council run up to see what the commotion is about]
177,13,3,Randy Marsh,What is this? What's going on?
178,13,3,Stephen Stotch,There! Look! [a shot of Kyle signing papers] It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.
179,13,3,Randy Marsh,What's he doing?
180,13,3,Stephen Stotch,"He's... paying for everyone's debts. [a shot of several lines of people walking up to Kyle, who takes each bill, enters the amount due into a card reader, and swipes his card through the reader to pay the debt]"
181,13,3,Darryl Weathers and Automotive Workers,"Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you."
182,13,3,Randy Marsh,But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
183,13,3,Man 15,So that people will have money to spend.
184,13,3,Sheila Broflovski,"[runs up to Kyle] Kyle! [gets on her knees] Kyle, you have to stop this! [begins to cry]"
185,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"It's okay, Ma."
186,13,3,Sheila Broflovski,"No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life! [stands up and walks away] Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! [Randy gets an idea, points towards his house, and leaves. More people walk towards Kyle, and this continues for hours. Kyle begins to moan from lack of energy as he continues paying off debts]"
187,13,3,Randy Marsh,[returns with his unpaid bills] Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
188,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[pays it off, with difficulty.] Heunh. [Randy smiles and walks away]"
189,13,3,Man 16,He paid for our debts so we could spend once more. [Kyle has stopped moving. A man steps up to check]
190,13,3,Man 17,He's dead.
191,13,3,Dr Doctor,"[steps up to check Kyle's pulse] No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed. [several men raise Kyle over their heads and gently carry him home.
