0,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? [closes the door and walks up to Jimmy]"
1,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy [chokes up] ...rou-routine."
2,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you."
3,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week."
4,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[heads to the sofa and lays down on his back] Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together."
5,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry."
6,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[while munching] No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else."
7,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
8,13,5,Eric Cartman,"No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. [Jimmy sighs and throws away a sheet of jokes. Hours later there are many more sheets on the floor]"
9,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"...So the Pope says, ""What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"""
10,13,5,Eric Cartman,Meh. [Jimmy tosses away another crumpled sheet]
11,13,5,Sarah Valmer,"Here's some fruit, boys. [sets the plate down by Jimmy] Better for you than potato chips. Oh Jimmy, look out, there's a black widow! [pulls out a newspaper from under Jimmy's desk and smashes the spider with it]"
12,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, thanks Mom. [she turns and walks away] You might have saved my life."
13,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?"
14,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. [gets an idea, indicated by a small bell]"
15,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I like fishsticks."
16,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks. [now he writes the joke excitedly] Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? [Cartman looks at him, then sits up]"
17,13,5,Eric Cartman,"What, dude, you got something?"
18,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?"
19,13,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
20,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
21,13,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
22,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?"
23,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[thinks through the joke] Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys."
24,13,5,Butters Stotch,"Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde."
25,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde."
26,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde."
27,13,5,Clyde Donovan,Hey.
28,13,5,Stan Marsh,[walks up to the other guys] What's going on?
29,13,5,Butters Stotch,Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
30,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?"
31,13,5,Clyde Donovan,Yes. [Butters covers his mouth to stifle a laugh]
32,13,5,Eric Cartman,Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
33,13,5,Clyde Donovan,Yes. [Butters covers his mouth to stifle a laugh]
34,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[points to Clyde with both index fingers] What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?"
35,13,5,Butters Stotch,"[runs up to Cartman and Clyde] HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! [Cartman laughs. Butters soon joins him. Clyde just smiles sheepishly, knowing that's a good joke. Token walks into view and Cartman runs to him. Clyde grins]"
36,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Token, Token, got a question for you: [clears his throat] Token, do you like fishsticks?"
37,13,5,Token Black,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. [Butters begins to giggle]"
38,13,5,Eric Cartman,[motions to Butters to keep quiet for now] Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters. [back to Token] You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
39,13,5,Token Black,Yes.
40,13,5,Eric Cartman,What are you?
41,13,5,Butters Stotch,"A gay fish? [Cartman laughs first, then Butters]"
42,13,5,Eric Cartman,"A gay fish? [Cartman laughs first, then Butters]"
43,13,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley! [runs towards the unseen voice] Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? [A hot new joke is born.]"
44,13,5,Mr Garrison,"Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?"
45,13,5,Mr Mackey,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?"
46,13,5,Stephen Stotch,"Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see."
47,13,5,Peterson,"Yeah, I like fishsticks."
48,13,5,Stephen Stotch,"What are you, Peterson? A gay fish? [everyone laughs]"
49,13,5,Announcer,"And now, here he is! Jimmy Kimmel! [the studio audience cheers as he goes onstage]"
50,13,5,Jimmy Kimmel,"Alright, hey, how are we all feelin' tonight? [the audience quiets down] So uhhh, let me ask the guys in the audience a question. Do you like fishsticks?"
51,13,5,The Guys,Yes.
52,13,5,Jimmy Kimmel,"Huh. What are you, gay fish? [everyone laughs]"
53,13,5,David Letterman and Paul Shaffer,"And so uhhh, hay Paul, do you like fishsticks, Paul?"
54,13,5,David Letterman and Paul Shaffer,"Uhhh, sure?"
55,13,5,David Letterman and Paul Shaffer,"What are you, Paul, a gay fish? [everyone cracks up over it. Someone in the audience keels over the balcony. Letterman tosses away his notes]"
56,13,5,Jay Leno,"So apparently more and more Americans are eating fishsticks. Have you seen this? Have you read about this? Loving fishsticks, kinda makes me wonder, you know? What is everybody, a gay fish? [the studio audience roars with laughter and two men in the front row fall off their chairs and throw up.]"
57,13,5,Tom Snyder,"It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him."
58,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!"
59,13,5,Tom Snyder,You. Really. Don't. Get it.
60,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!"
61,13,5,Tom Snyder,You're a rapper.
62,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Yes.
63,13,5,Tom Snyder,An entrepreneur.
64,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Yes.
65,13,5,Tom Snyder,And you like fishsdicks.
66,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Yes.
67,13,5,Tom Snyder,You're a gay fish.
68,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,No! I am not no gay fish!
69,13,5,Tom Snyder,Just gay?
70,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man!
71,13,5,Tom Snyder,[this time goes through joke one step at a time] You are male?
72,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Damn right I'm male.
73,13,5,Tom Snyder,A male that like fish dicks.
74,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Yeah, I like fishsticks"
75,13,5,Tom Snyder,You like to put fish dicks in your mouth.
76,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Yeah.
77,13,5,Tom Snyder,You're a gay fish.
78,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! [stands up pushes him off his chair]"
79,13,5,Eric Cartman,"And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television."
80,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"We know, Cartman!"
81,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke."
82,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,P-patent?
83,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated."
84,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh."
85,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! [smiles, takes his tray and walks away]"
86,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?"
87,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh..."
88,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers."
89,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Actually it was potato chips.
90,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!"
91,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room."
92,13,5,Craig Tucker,Then just give him half.
93,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
94,13,5,Craig Tucker,"I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half."
95,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!"
96,13,5,Craig Tucker,"Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon."
97,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"""
98,13,5,Craig Tucker,Just give him half.
99,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills. [a doctor steps up next to him] Doctor, do I have gills?"
100,13,5,Doctor,He does not have gills.
101,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?
102,13,5,Reporter 1,Do you like fishsticks?
103,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Love 'em!
104,13,5,Reporter 2,You're a gay fish. [a third reporter laughs and soon the rest of the room is laughing]
105,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,No I'm not- AAAARGH! [grabs the sides of the podium and shakes with anger]
106,13,5,Conan O Brien,"Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia."
107,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"[dancing in his seat] Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!"
108,13,5,Conan O Brien,"So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?"
109,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, """"Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks?"" And my homeboy says ""Yeah Carlos"" you know, ""you're so funny!"" And then it just occurred to me. I said, ""Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!"" [the studio audience roars with laughter, and he begins to dance in his seat again] And this is how I came up with it, my amigos! [Conan claps. Cartman, looking at the show on TV, is pissed off]"
110,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[shakes with rage, then turns left and walks away] Motherfucker!"
111,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!"
112,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Really?
113,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!"
114,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much."
115,13,5,Eric Cartman,"But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!"
116,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did."
117,13,5,Eric Cartman,What?!
118,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips."
119,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?"
120,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?"
121,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'."
122,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together."
123,13,5,Sarah Valmer,Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.
124,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish? [Jimmy and Cartman laugh, but Cartman notices something on Jimmy's desk.] Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! [gets off the couch, gets a newspaper, walks over to the desk, and smashes the spider dead.]"
125,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, thanks Eric."
126,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Is that... Is that how it happened?
127,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew."
128,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,I'm... I'm sorry?
129,13,5,Eric Cartman,"It's cool man, it's cool. [turns around and walks away]"
130,13,5,Announcer,"Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!"
131,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"[gets onstage] Yo. Ungh. Yo. [turns to look at the audience] Yo, whoa! Whoa, what the hell?! [a lot of audience members carry signs saying that Kanye is a gay fish and that he likes fishsticks]"
132,13,5,Audience,Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!
133,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Yo, fuck this noise, yo! [throws down his mic and storms offstage]"
134,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?"
135,13,5,House,"Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it."
136,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see... [he's writing on a whiteboard. So far he has ""Fishsticks + Me = Gayfish""] Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish."
137,13,5,Aide 1,"Kanye, really..."
138,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Shut up! [looks at the whiteboard again.] Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks? [adds more words to the board] They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim. [begins connecting words] Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?"
139,13,5,House,"No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don't, don't you get it? You see, fish dicks is a is a play on words."
140,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"I don't need anyone tellin' me ""play on words""! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!"
141,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?"
142,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing."
143,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks off a bit] It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke. [Kyle zips up and goes to the sink to wash his hands] I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. [Kyle finishes up, grabs a paper towel, wipes his hands dry, and turns to Cartman]"
144,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You know what, Cartman? I believe you."
145,13,5,Eric Cartman,You do?
146,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! [turns and leaves the bathroom]"
147,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[after some thought] But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?"
148,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?"
149,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
150,13,5,Eric Cartman,That's cool. You wanna write some together? [walks out of view]
151,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
152,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[pulls up a chair] Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks"
153,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey, you're really onto something there."
154,13,5,Sarah Valmer,"Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all."
155,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer. [she walks off] Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?"""
156,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Right. And then I say, ""Yeah."""
157,13,5,Eric Cartman,"So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?"""
158,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh wow, this is incredible! [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look at the source of the crash. A dragon wanders in]"
159,13,5,Sarah Valmer,What is that?
160,13,5,Eric Cartman,"It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! [leaps out of his seat with a sword out of nowhere and slashes the dragon across the chest, making it bleed. It falls on its back all of a sudden. Eric leaps onto its body and stabs the sword into its chest. It dies.]"
161,13,5,Butters Stotch,"[looks through the window] Hey look, Eric killed a dragon."
162,13,5,Clyde Donovan,[opens the front door] He's the most awesome kid in school!
163,13,5,Wendy Testaburger,And he's not fat at all.
164,13,5,Eric Cartman,Thanks you guys!
165,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over."
166,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?"
167,13,5,Aide 2,"Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money."
168,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Found who?
169,13,5,Aide 2,"You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg."
170,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"[tied down to a chair in Kanye's study, his voice shaking] Come on, maaaan. What is this, maaaan? What the fuck is goin' on maaaan? [Kanye enters the room. His entourage makes way] Oh fuck maaaan, Kanye Wehhst? Noo shiiit maaan, okay look it wasn't me. I didn't really start the fishstick thing, alriight?"
171,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.
172,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan."
173,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!
174,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick."
175,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.
176,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Awww shih oh no man, come on, I got no dick, man! [Kanye's men whip out their own back and start whacking Mencia all over. His right hand gets broken, his left shin bleeds. The men stop as Kanye approaches him]"
177,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"[in Mencia's face] Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish?"
178,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan."
179,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Why- Look at me, look at me! [Mencia manages to look at him] I love fishsticks. I love putting fishsticks in my mouth. [waits a while for an answer]"
180,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"You're a- ...you're a gay fish, maaan. [Kanye backs up, swings at Mencia and decapitates him, leaving his head hanging from his body by some skin]"
181,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it. [the audience laughs] But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer. [Cartman and Jimmy go onstage and sit on the couch facing Ellen] Hey guys!"
182,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hi Ellen. [to the audience] Do you guys like fishsticks? [the audience laughs] Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you."
183,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?"
184,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,It was just a-
185,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you."
186,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?"
187,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-"
188,13,5,Eric Cartman,Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. [the audience applauds and cheers]
189,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?"
190,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Yes Ma'am. [the best and worst of times for him]
191,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia."
192,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? [Jimmy and Cartman are alarmed]
193,13,5,Eric Cartman,Uhhh excuse me? [the crowd gets rowdy.]
194,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play. [walks up to the wall-mounted TV and smashes it with the bat.]
195,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials."
196,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
197,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that was kewl huh?"
198,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Eric, there's something I really need to know."
199,13,5,Eric Cartman,Whassat?
200,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke. [Cartman gets worried] But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
201,13,5,Eric Cartman,So... here it is.
202,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
203,13,5,Eric Cartman,"That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did! [Kanye kicks the bedroom door open and enters the room. His men pour in and start smashing the furniture apart] Dude, it's Puff Daddy!"
204,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Tie up these motherfuckers! [cut to the next scene, in which Kanye swings at a lamp and shatters it, then looks at his hostages] Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!"
205,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are."
206,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!
207,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-"
208,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!"
209,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-"
210,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!"
211,13,5,Eric Cartman,Hello Jim.
212,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!"
213,13,5,Eric Cartman,[moves the glasses back over his cap] What are you up to?
214,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough."
215,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. [goes for a chair]"
216,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. [hands his joke sheet to Cartman as Cartman brings the chair over and sits next to him]"
217,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy."
218,13,5,Sarah Valmer,"[brings in a plate of potato chips] Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat."
219,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Thanks. [Sarah walks away] So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look around.]"
220,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,What was that? [Butters opens the door and steps in]
221,13,5,Butters Stotch,"Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! [outside, everyone scatters as robots march down the street firing off semiautomatic weapons. Cartman runs out to see what's happening. Butters and Jimmy follow right behind. Officer Barbrady and Mayor McDaniels look on helplessly]"
222,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here? [takes off his glasses] Flame on! [becomes engulfed in flames and flies into the air. He then sends streams of flames at the robots, destroying them instantly. He flies back down to his starting point] Flame off! [the flames disappear. Other fourth graders appear: Annie, Millie, Red, Clyde, Token and Wendy]"
223,13,5,Wendy Testaburger,"You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman."
224,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke! [runs in and finishes the joke in a flourish. Jimmy walks in] ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! [other kids look in]"
225,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!"
226,13,5,Eric Cartman,Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
227,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,What?!
228,13,5,Eric Cartman,"You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault."
229,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?"
230,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now."
231,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"What? I, I still don't get anything."
232,13,5,Eric Cartman,"All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things."
233,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Rih, r-r-really?"
234,13,5,Eric Cartman,"I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are. [Kanye looks as if Cartman is talking about him] Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that."
235,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding."
236,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me. [walks up to the boys and genuflects before them] Boys I understand what you did now. [to his men] Untie them guys. I know what I have to do.
237,13,5,Aide 2,Yo Kanye! You sure about this?
238,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me. [turns and faces his entourage.] Let all my fans know I love 'em, but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever. Don't be sad for me guys! [turns around, runs, and dives into the ocean below] I'm goin' home! [his crew looks down into the water as Kanye begins swimming in his new environment]"
239,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"(Uh. Come on.)
I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down.
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish...
 'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl)
Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh)
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore
 'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said
That I had to make a switch (dead fish)...
Now I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a, I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (Yes, now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish."
