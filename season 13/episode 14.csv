0,13,14,Eric Cartman,"We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park!
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like!
[Kyle flashes a look of anger at him]"
1,13,14,Stan Marsh,"[annoyed] Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. [his father Randy is driving. The other boys present are Butters and Kenny]"
2,13,14,Eric Cartman,"This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year."
3,13,14,Butters Stotch,What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
4,13,14,Eric Cartman,"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities."
5,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"W-What are you talking about, Eric?"
6,13,14,Eric Cartman,"You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off."
7,13,14,Stan Marsh,We're here! It's the water park! [Randy pulls up at the front entrance and drops the boys off.]
8,13,14,Randy Marsh,"I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4:00, you got it?"
9,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Come on, let's go!"
10,13,14,Stan Marsh,"We got it, Dad."
11,13,14,Eric Cartman,"[hands the clerk some money] Six adorable children, please."
12,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool! [finally gets to the wave pool, but gets pissed off] Oh, what the hell?! [the pool is quite crowded with people of all races enjoying themselves. The other five boys catch up to Cartman]"
13,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?"
14,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?"
15,13,14,Eric Cartman,[with a stunned look on his face] Forget it! Just forget it! [walks off in anger. The other five are confused]
16,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is awesome."
17,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
18,13,14,Butters Stotch,"[stops] Hey fellers, fellas hang on! I've gotta go to the bathroom. [Kenny continues across the pool without the other boys]"
19,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, go ahead. [turns back to Stan and Jimmy]"
20,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Okay, thanks. [goes to the bathroom right there, no stepping out of the pool or nothin']"
21,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?"
22,13,14,Stan Marsh,Okay.
23,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, [glances back at Butters] check it out, I- [looks back again and sees what happened.] Butters, BUTTERS! What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!"
24,13,14,Butters Stotch,"You said ""go ahead""."
25,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat."
26,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, Butters' pee is in there."
27,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it."
28,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do."
29,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,No they don't!
30,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they do, Kyle."
31,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tu-tu-twenty five seconds ago."
32,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Dude!
33,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath."
34,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,NO!
35,13,14,Eric Cartman,"What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go oooooon.

There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.

There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!"
36,13,14,Ride operator,Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
37,13,14,Eric Cartman,Just do it in English!
38,13,14,Eric Cartman,"There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park

(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park)."
39,13,14,Stan Marsh,"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?"
40,13,14,Butters Stotch,You bet!
41,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not getting back in the water.
42,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Aw come on, Kyle."
43,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?"
44,13,14,Stan Marsh,Not everybody pees in pools.
45,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Do you pee in the pool?
46,13,14,Stan Marsh,Not today... yet.
47,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, come on!"
48,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?"
49,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Most likely.
50,13,14,Eric Cartman,"[running up to the boys] You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!"
51,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, where have you been?"
52,13,14,Eric Cartman,I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
53,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,So what?
54,13,14,Eric Cartman,So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
55,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well then they're not minorities, are they?"
56,13,14,Eric Cartman,...What do you mean?
57,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!"
58,13,14,Eric Cartman,The black and brown people.
59,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"No, you're the minority!"
60,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!"
61,13,14,Stan Marsh,This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
62,13,14,Eric Cartman,Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
63,13,14,Butters Stotch,The who?
64,13,14,Eric Cartman,The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
65,13,14,Stan Marsh,I'm gonna go on the slides.
66,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Whoopie! [Stan, Butters, Jimmy, and Kenny take their leave]"
67,13,14,Eric Cartman,"You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on! [only Kyle is left at the table, and Cartman remembers this and slowly turns to him] Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?"
68,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Blow it out your ass, Cartman! [leaves the table without taking a bite from his hamburger. He walks by an elderly couple in a pool]"
69,13,14,Elderly Woman,"Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?"
70,13,14,Elderly Man,"Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything."
71,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Eewww! [walks away quickly. Nearby, a man takes a water sample]"
72,13,14,Water Tester,Oh my God.
73,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi Pi. How can I heelp you."
74,13,14,x Tester and His Assistant,"Pi Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park."
75,13,14,Water Tester,I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now 98% pee.
76,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?"
77,13,14,x Tester and His Assistant,"Pi Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty three percent. [with some urgency] You have to shut down."
78,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggest-a weekend. Everyone is having a-theh fun."
79,13,14,Water Tester,"You're endangering people's lives! [shows him the test results] If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!"
80,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?
81,13,14,Water Tester,One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!
82,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Gehntlemen, please-a. I come-a from ada Venice. [shows off a real life picture of a canal in Venice] Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee."
83,13,14,Water Tester,You have to evacuate people now!
84,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!
85,13,14,Water Tester,"[now at the door with his assistant about to leave] If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. [they leave]"
86,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!"
87,13,14,Stan Marsh,"This is sweet, huh Kenny? [Kenny, who's facing away from the camera, doesn't say anything. A girl in an inner tube floats past the boys, then stops and lets loose some pee. Sure enough, the ground begins to rumble and shake.]"
88,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"W-What's that? [Explosions of pee come out of every ride, overrunning them all. A huge pee wave rises over the park and swamps it, destroying every structure. An unlucky slider is swept down in a rush of pee. A woman loses her baby as the wave strikes her back. The pee tsunami sweeps across the Mt. Everest attraction. A statue of a man scaling the mountain falls off]"
89,13,14,Man 1,It's pee! [turns to run from it]
90,13,14,Man 2,"Look out for the pee! [Kyle, who's playing a Zombie Fighter video game, looks back to see what's all the commotion. The pee-nami hits the New York Splash attraction, mowing down its structures]"
91,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Aaaaah! GROSS! [leaves the game and makes a run for it. A volcano blows up and chunks of lava drop all over the place. The wave pool gets unstable, threatening to throw people out with its wild waves]"
92,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"[holding on to the sign post] Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! [the sign post breaks off and both man and post are swept away by the pee. Stan, Butters, and Jimmy climb up the Mr. Everest sign]"
93,13,14,Floating Man,[swept away] Aaaah!
94,13,14,Stan Marsh,"[in a shaky voice] Aaaah! [stops and looks at the pee, and sees a familiar boy floating in the water, face down] OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED KENNY!"
95,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[running up some stairs in Drop Zone!!] Aw, sick! [the pee below him is rising]"
96,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. [Randy quickly arrives in his station wagon and runs up to the captain]
97,13,14,Randy Marsh,What's going on?
98,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,I told you people to keep civilians back!
99,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?"
100,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-"
101,13,14,Officer 1,"Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. [the water tester and his assistant walk into view]"
102,13,14,Water Tester,"We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable."
103,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,So this is all pee-related.
104,13,14,Water Tester,"Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning."
105,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,And?
106,13,14,Water Tester,"It was almost all pee, no H."
107,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God. I've gotta help him! [starts to run to the gate, but the captain catches him and pulls him back.]"
108,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,Stay BACK!
109,13,14,Randy Marsh,You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
110,13,14,Officer 2,"Sir, it's possible with a crane we could help any survivors out."
111,13,14,Water Tester,I think that would be a very bad idea.
112,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,And why is that?
113,13,14,Water Tester,"Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change."
114,13,14,Fireman 1,Change how?
115,13,14,Water Tester,"All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey. [a researcher wheels in a monkey who's been shackled to a dolly] We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. [unzips his pants and turns to face the monkey, then starts peeing on it. He first pees on the chest, no reaction. He moves the stream up to the monkey's face and the monkey begins to protest. The monkey tries to escape the pee stream, but the tester just keeps the stream on it as best he can.]"
116,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,My God! He's become full of rage!
117,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Aahhh...
118,13,14,Stan Marsh,"[on a small plateau on the attraction] Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!"
119,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,No way!
120,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"You've gotta swim over here, Kyle."
121,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Come on, Kyle!"
122,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's all pee!"
123,13,14,Stan Marsh,Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
124,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,I'll die if I do swim in it!
125,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!"
126,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
127,13,14,Stan Marsh,"[hesitantly] ...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom."
128,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,WHAT?
129,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim."
130,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
131,13,14,Stan Marsh,Not... all the time.
132,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,That is gross!!
133,13,14,Stan Marsh,Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
134,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! [the sign drops further into the yellow urine]"
135,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, come on!"
136,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, goddamnit! [climbs down the sign and into the pee. He holds his face high up as much as he can as he swims across] Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, [He climbs up and joins his friends on the plateau. He pants, dripping with pee]"
137,13,14,Butters Stotch,Do you need to wash your hands?
138,13,14,Eric Cartman,Help! Help!
139,13,14,Man 1,"Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! [a branch hangs off a Floom Zoom boat]"
140,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me! [grabs onto the branch and is hoisted onto the boat. He catches his breath] Oh, oh, oh. [sits up and looks around - it's all minorities in the boat]"
141,13,14,Man 2,Are you okay?
142,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you."
143,13,14,Man 2,Well what are we gonna do now?
144,13,14,Woman 1,We've gotta just wait it out.
145,13,14,Woman 2,"Yeah, but for how long?"
146,13,14,Man 3,We need to find somethin' to paddle with.
147,13,14,Eric Cartman,"[pulls out a memo pad and pen and writes the following] Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live. [puts the pad and pen away somewhere...] Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. [the other survivors just look at him]"
148,13,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying."
149,13,14,Randy Marsh,"It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!"
150,13,14,Sharon Marsh,What is all pee?
151,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died."
152,13,14,Sharon Marsh,What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!
153,13,14,Randy Marsh,"I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants."
154,13,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, you've got to do something!"
155,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Calm down, Sharon, all right?! [shakes his head vigorously] Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors."
156,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,[on the phone with someone] I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands! [hangs up] Damn it where is that antidote?!
157,13,14,Researcher 1,"[with red hair] Here! Here! We think we have it, sir! [three researchers walk into view] It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine."
158,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys! [three monkeys are wheeled in on dollies]"
159,13,14,Water Tester,"Let's hope to Christ this works. [each researcher takes a monkey and injects it with the antidote. Then they start pissing on the monkeys, and the monkeys protest almost immediately] No, damn it, no!"
160,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,They're still angry.
161,13,14,Researcher 1,This one's really angry.
162,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"It's out of control! [quickly takes a gun from a police officer and shoots the middle monkey first, then the one on the left, then the one on the right. All of them die.] Find an antidote that works! [the researchers leave]"
163,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?"
164,13,14,Stan Marsh,I don't know. [they hear the sobs of a crying man nearby]
165,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Why? Why didn't Pi Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi Pi, but-a the Pi Pi not-a belieeve them. [sobs some more. The boys approach him]"
166,13,14,Stan Marsh,Who are you?
167,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"[stands up and faces them] Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee."
168,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, well people should [looks at Stan and Butters] know that peeing in pools is [looks at Jimmy] bad!"
169,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open the door then the pee can be lowered.
170,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,Okay. W-where's the maintenance room?
171,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? [Stan, Butters and Jimmy all look at Kyle, who looks back at them]"
172,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,No!
173,13,14,Butters Stotch,"You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle."
174,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Not in pee!
175,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"[grabs Kyle by the left wrist and pulls him away from his friends] Please-a you have to hurry! [lets go] I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower."
176,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,[looks back at the other boys] Oh who pees in the shower?!
177,13,14,Stan Marsh,"...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower."
178,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee."
179,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't pee in the shower, dude. That's fucking disgusting!"
180,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!"
181,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ!
182,13,14,Eric Cartman,"It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... [imagines himself in class with a bunch of non-white students]"
183,13,14,Teacher,"[A black man] All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report."
184,13,14,Eric Cartman,"I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie."
185,13,14,Teacher,Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
186,13,14,Eric Cartman,...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
187,13,14,Teacher,Good.
188,13,14,Eric Cartman,Noooo... [now imagines himself at a job interview] Trying to find a job will be even harder.
189,13,14,Se or Lopez,"You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?"
190,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, I do just as much work."
191,13,14,Se or Lopez,[laughs] You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.
192,13,14,Eric Cartman,Noooo... [now imagines himself at an open council meeting] Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
193,13,14,Coucilman and Audience,All those in favor of putting white people in camps?
194,13,14,Coucilman and Audience,Aye!
195,13,14,Coucilman and Audience,All those opposed?
196,13,14,Eric Cartman,Noooo...
197,13,14,Coucilman and Audience,The minorities win! [Cartman comes out of his daydream]
198,13,14,Eric Cartman,"[throws down his pad and pen and stands up] NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! [turns away and squeezes his eyes shut.]"
199,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface."
200,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Let's just get this over with!
201,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?
202,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
203,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,Good-a. Now just one last thing. [takes a glass sitting next to him and scoops some pee into it] You need to drink-a some pee.
204,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
205,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
206,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Why?!
207,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate."
208,13,14,Stan Marsh,"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?"
209,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"I am not, not, d-rinking pee!"
210,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!"
211,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Just drink the pee, Kyle."
212,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Please, Kyle, I wanna go home."
213,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!"
214,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
215,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly."
216,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,No!
217,13,14,Water Tester,"Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata."
218,13,14,Researcher 2,"[balding, with gray hair] Wait, you mean a banana."
219,13,14,Water Tester,Yes.
220,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey! [another monkey is brought forth strapped to a dolly] All right, Connors. [Officer connors offers a banana to the monkey, who takes a bite of it after a few seconds. A researcher steps up and starts peeing on the monkey. The monkey doesn't mind it, but just takes another bite of the banana.]"
221,13,14,Fireman 2,"Holy God, it works!"
222,13,14,"Police Captain and Officers, including Stevens","All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-"
223,13,14,Water Tester,"Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human."
224,13,14,Randy Marsh,"I'll do it. [the officers and firefighters make way for Randy.] You can test the antidote on me. [two researchers take Randy and sit him down in the dolly, then strap him in.]"
225,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,[walks up to Randy] You sure you want to do this?
226,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Give me the banana. [the balding researcher walks to him and gives him the banana. Randy takes a bite. The fire marshal unzips his pants and starts peeing on Randy] Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh. [tries his best to keep his cool, but shakes his head] Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah."
227,13,14,Researcher 3,He looks agitated...
228,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww."
229,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun! [Stevens moves to hand his gun to the fire marshal]"
230,13,14,Randy Marsh,"No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay."
231,13,14,Water Tester,He's all right!
232,13,14,Fireman 3,The banana worked!
233,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude!"
234,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,I'm thinking about it!
235,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle."
236,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW! [Kyle begins to drink it, then stops]"
237,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Gah, ah. [swallows once more] Gaagh."
238,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee."
239,13,14,Butters Stotch,"You can do it, Kyle!"
240,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Aaahh. Well- [gulps down the rest of the glass and throws the glass away] AAAAH! [the glass breaks on a boulder off screen]
241,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a [some helicopters are heard approaching]"
242,13,14,Butters Stotch,[points to them] Hey look! [the helicopters are shown. Randy looks out from one of them]
243,13,14,Randy Marsh,[waving a small red show] Stan! [steps aside so the firefighters can drop down a rope ladder]
244,13,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, they finally came for us. [he, Butters and Jimmy have wide smiles]"
245,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,[pissed off] Are you fucking kidding me?! [more rope ladders drop down from the other helicopters as the rescuers cheer]
246,13,14,Randy Marsh,"[stops] Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. [walks away]"
247,13,14,Eric Cartman,Guys? Guys! [walks into view and hugs Stan] Oh it's true! You all did survive!
248,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Hawww, you lived?"
249,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?"
250,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot."
251,13,14,Eric Cartman,"It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!"
252,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
253,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Aw come on. It was just a little pee, Kyle."
254,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!"
255,13,14,Water Tester,"All right everyone, quick! Here you go!"
256,13,14,Butters Stotch,What's this?
257,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,You all need to eat your banana immediately!
258,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell for?!
259,13,14,"Police Captain and Officers, including Stevens",[cocks his gun and aims at Kyle] Eat the banana or we have to put you down!
260,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,[frustrated] AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!
