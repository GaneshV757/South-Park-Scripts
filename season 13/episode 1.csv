0,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?"
1,13,1,Stan Marsh,"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me."
2,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's just so astounding."
3,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened. [the boys are looking at Kenny and a girl eating alone together at another table.] Kenny has a girlfriend."
4,13,1,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend."
5,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
6,13,1,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, so, w-who is she?"
7,13,1,Eric Cartman,Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
8,13,1,Butters Stotch,"[runs up to the boys' table] Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!"
9,13,1,Stan Marsh,What?
10,13,1,Butters Stotch,"[panting softly] Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!"
11,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader."
12,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Um, does Kenny like her?"
13,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever."
14,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, no. Oh, geez!"
15,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[getting irritated] Butters, what's the problem?"
16,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's."
17,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
18,13,1,Butters Stotch,"It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. ""Tammy Warner is a total slut!"""
19,13,1,Eric Cartman,"That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!"
20,13,1,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me."
21,13,1,Stan Marsh,"[sighs] All right, come on, guys. [leaves the table with Kyle and Cartman.]"
22,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?"
23,13,1,Girl 1,"So, anyway, I passed him a note, but then Johnny... [Kenny walks alone down a different hall. Stan catches up to him]"
24,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! [Kyle and Cartman are with him]"
25,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh, hi, guys.)"
26,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend."
27,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(What about her?)
28,13,1,Stan Marsh,"[sighs and lowers his head] Oh, boy."
29,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but..."
30,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(But what?)
31,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"W-well, we've heard that she's..."
32,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Kenny. [deep sigh, puts his right hand on Kenny's back for sympathy] Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's."
33,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"[afraid, high voice] (Huh?)"
34,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Your girlfriend's a slut, dude."
35,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) [jumps for joy, dances down the hall, makes a right and runs off.]"
36,13,1,Eric Cartman,[moments later] He took it pretty well.
37,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"[cheerfully] (Hey, Tammy!)"
38,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?"
39,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)"
40,13,1,Tammy Warner,TGI Friday's?
41,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yep. I like the food!)
42,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Yeah, okay. But... [walks away a few steps] Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true. [Kenny dances with glee, but Tammy doesn't see this. She gets apologetic] But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault! [Kenny stops dancing] See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers."
43,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Jonas Brothers?)
44,13,1,Tammy Warner,"You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control. [Kenny starts dancing again] And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's, [Kenny stops] and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken? [Kenny walks up to her, puts a consoling hand on her shoulder, and sighs]"
45,13,1,Clerk,"There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert."
46,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Thanks.) [turns around and walks out with his tickets]
47,13,1,Eric Cartman,"The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? [Kenny continues walking, the other three join him as he walks across the parking lot]"
48,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
49,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)"
50,13,1,Stan Marsh,A B.J.?
51,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
52,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Of course, dude!)"
53,13,1,Eric Cartman,[forcibly stops Kenny] Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
54,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, that's gross."
55,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[turns right and leaves the other boys behind] (I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
56,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,What kind of protection?
57,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)"
58,13,1,Clerk 2,"Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?"
59,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)"
60,13,1,Clerk 2,"These here? Why, certainly. [The Clerk reaches for a box on a rack and hands it to Kenny. Kenny reads the cover: ""Big Mamba. The world's #1 condom. Trusted for over 50 years.""]"
61,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Cool!) [Kenny pays for the condoms and turns to head out the door]
62,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?"
63,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)"
64,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[reaches out to Kenny and stops him] Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?"
65,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yep! Woo-hoo!) [skips away]
66,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome? [the lights go out and cameras begin to take pictures of the stage. Soon the stage lights come up and the Jonas Brothers appear. The girls go wild]"
67,13,1,Joe Jonas,"I'm ready to get it on.
But there's no gettin' on until I'm ready.
Too soon, slow down.
Take it easy, oh, my girl, I need your love. Bay-bay!"
68,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I can't wait till the day I kiss you.
Until then I have to tease you.
'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty.
She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty."
69,13,1,Joe,Bay-bay! I'm hot.
70,13,1,Nick Jonas,He's hot.
71,13,1,Little Girl,[putting her hands over her crotch] My 'giney tickles! [she scratches her crotch to stop the tickles. Most other girls do the same thing]
72,13,1,Tammy Warner,"[grabs onto Kenny's parka] Oh, my God. It's that tingling again. [a girl has left her seat and is in an aisle gyrating her butt up and down. Tammy gets up on her seat and screams towards the band] I love you! [she's shocked at what she just said, then begins dancing in her seat. Kenny sits in his seat unenthused, wondering when the payoff is coming.]"
73,13,1,Joe,Tell me how was I to know?
74,13,1,Jonas Brothers,You'd take your love and go.
75,13,1,Joe,Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
76,13,1,Jonas Brothers,To put my arm around you?
77,13,1,Joe,The seasons change.
78,13,1,Kevin Jonas,Bay-bay!
79,13,1,Joe,And the world goes round.
80,13,1,Nick,The world goes round and round and round.
81,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time.
Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause,
yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow.
And then someday we can get it on.
Until then, go back to Montreal."
82,13,1,Joe,"'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!"
83,13,1,Nick,"Love you, bay-bay!"
84,13,1,Kevin,Bay-bay!
85,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Whoooooo! [a toddler makes her way towards the stage by climbing over the rows of cheering girls] Aaah-oww! [in another seat Mr. Slave is masturbating with his left hand as he reaches towards the stage with his right one.] You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!"
86,13,1,The Jonas Brothers,"Good night, Denver. We love you all! [skips off the stage] We love you, Denver! [skips off the stage] Good night! [skips off the stage]"
87,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!"
88,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) [grabs her hand and they walked towards the exit]"
89,13,1,An Usher At the Pepsi Center concert,"And, uh, you too, little girl in the red."
90,13,1,Tammy Warner,[looks over her shoulder] Huh?
91,13,1,An Usher At the Pepsi Center concert,"Band would like you to come backstage. You, too, little girl in the puppy T-shirt. [the blonde girl looks down at her shirt, shrieks, and makes her way to the usher]"
92,13,1,Tammy Warner,"They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!"
93,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"[pulling at Tammy] (No, no, we're going to your place now!)"
94,13,1,Tammy Warner,It's a dream come true! [Tammy lets go of Kenny and goes down the aisle towards the usher]
95,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[gives chase] (Hey!)
96,13,1,An Usher At the Pepsi Center concert,"All right, right this way, girls."
97,13,1,Roadie,"Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you. [quickly blocks Kenny from entering.] Uh, not you. [kicks Kenny aside a few times]"
98,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(No, fuck that, dude! I bought the fucking tickets!) [the roadie closes the door and Kenny starts pounding on it] (Hey! What the fuck?!)"
99,13,1,Roadie 2,"[in a sensuous voice] The Jonas Brothers will be right out, girls. [leaves]"
100,13,1,Girl in Puppy T shirt,Why do you think they called us back here?
101,13,1,Fat Girl,They must-a wanna have sex with us.
102,13,1,Tammy Warner,What? You think so?
103,13,1,Fat Girl,"Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs."
104,13,1,Girl in Puppy T shirt,"Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!"
105,13,1,Girl in O T shirt,"Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!"
106,13,1,Tammy Warner,Me neither. [suddenly the brothers appear]
107,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"Hey, there, girls! [all of a sudden the girls' mouths pop open as their jaws drop. As the brothers talk, they strike poses]"
108,13,1,Joe,"Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience."
109,13,1,Nick,"Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there."
110,13,1,Fat Girl,Let's just get to the blowjobs.
111,13,1,Joe,Blow what?
112,13,1,Kevin,"[to his brothers] I don't know. [to the girls] Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you."
113,13,1,Nick,And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.
114,13,1,Tammy Warner,[perplexed] Purity rings?
115,13,1,Joe,We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
116,13,1,Kevin,And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.
117,13,1,Nick,That's just how we roll.
118,13,1,Kevin,Yeah.
119,13,1,Nick,"Yeah. [they high-five each other. In a wide shot, we see Kenny peering in on the exchange through a transom window.]"
120,13,1,Joe,"So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?"
121,13,1,The Girls,[mesmerized] Okay.
122,13,1,Kevin,"And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll."
123,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear."
124,13,1,Stan Marsh,"So how did it go last night? [Kenny breathes in deep and sighs, takes off his left glove and shows the other boys the purity ring Tammy gave him]"
125,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
126,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(A purity ring.)
127,13,1,Eric Cartman,Purity ring?
128,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)"
129,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"...Well, what does that mean?"
130,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
131,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-"
132,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
133,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex."
134,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah.) [Kenny crosses his arms and tries his best to be agreeable with Kyle, but looks at his left ring finger and uncrosses his arms, breaking the act] (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) [Kenny walks away bawling. The other boys just watch him leave]"
135,13,1,Butters Stotch,[runs up to the boys] Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
136,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now."
137,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh, what's that?"
138,13,1,Stan Marsh,They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
139,13,1,Butters Stotch,[gets pensive] Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
140,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true.
I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble, 
'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other.
But who needs sex and drugs and partying 
When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix...
Bay-bay!
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave.
No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break.
I made a commitment and it is forever, 
So we can spend every waking minute together.
And if we get bored it won't be a problem, 
'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings...
Bay-bay!"
141,13,1,Purity Boy 1,"Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?"
142,13,1,Purity Boy 2,"You know? What Carole and I enjoy is Grey's Anatomy. We love Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Carole?"
143,13,1,Purity Boy 3,"We adore Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Nancy?"
144,13,1,Nancy,"Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch Grey's Anatomy?"
145,13,1,Purity Boy 1,We look forward to it all week long. [chuckles. Sarah laughs with him]
146,13,1,Purity Boy 3,Sure is sweet.
147,13,1,Purity Boy 1,It's the most fun I've had in weeks. [laughter]
148,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
What I cannot do.
Bay... bay...
Baaay...
Baybay.
Baybay.
Baaaybaaaaay."
149,13,1,Director,"Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys."
150,13,1,Joe,This is bullpucky!
151,13,1,Kevin,"Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!"
152,13,1,Director,"Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem."
153,13,1,Joe,"Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!"
154,13,1,Kevin,"Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe."
155,13,1,Disney Exec 1,"Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image."
156,13,1,Joe,We don't care about the company.
157,13,1,Director,And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
158,13,1,Kevin,We aren'--we aren't afraid of him.
159,13,1,Disney Exec 2,"Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now."
160,13,1,Disney Exec 3,"[looks out the door] Oh Jesus, he's here. The boss is here!"
161,13,1,Kevin,"Let's be strong, guys."
162,13,1,Disney Exec 3,[opens the door just a crack and looks out again] Hello sir. How was your trip? [the door flies open and in walks a swaggering Mickey Mouse]
163,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[looks around] What's all this I'm hearing about not wearing the purity rings, haha?"
164,13,1,Director,Uh we'll just leave you alone. [he and the other executives clear out of the room]
165,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?"
166,13,1,Kevin,We... need to talk about something.
167,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha."
168,13,1,Joe,"Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings."
169,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha."
170,13,1,Joe,Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
171,13,1,Mickey Mouse,The rings stay on!
172,13,1,Joe,"Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. [Mickey walks over and punches him in the balls. Joe groans and falls forward to the ground]"
173,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[Mickey kicks Joe's his body with every accented word] You DON'T... FUCKING...TALK to me...Like THAT, haha. You LITTLE... PIECE of... SHIT, Haha! [Joe coughs up some blood] Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha. [Joe begins to stand, then gets some help from his brother. Mickey wipes his gloves clean] Now, do we have a problem?! Haha."
174,13,1,Nick,"No, sir."
175,13,1,Kevin,"No, Mr. Mouse."
176,13,1,Joe,"[softly] No, Mr. Mouse."
177,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha. [heads for the door] Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha. [shuts the door behind him as he leaves. A picture of the brothers falls from the back of the door and shatters on the floor.]"
178,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yup, he's in here. [Stan and Cartman appear behind him, then they all exit frame, reappearing at the video section.]"
179,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!"
180,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!"
181,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[unusually resigned] (Look at this. More DVDs.) [shows the DVD to the guys]
182,13,1,Eric Cartman,[takes the DVD and looks at the front cover. Kenny freezes with his left hand held out] Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
183,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude."
184,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[notices that Kenny has stopped responding.] Kenny? Kenny? [snaps his fingers] Kenny? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna look at Playboy? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?"
185,13,1,Stan Marsh,"[takes the DVD from Cartman and hands it back to Kenny] You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?"
186,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"[starts responding and takes the DVD] (Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)"
187,13,1,Stan Marsh,"[takes Kyle and Cartman aside] You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him."
188,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd."
189,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[notices something on the shelf next to him] Oh my God, look at this! [grabs it and looks at it] Motherfucker!"
190,13,1,Stan Marsh,What? [he and Kyle walk up to get a better look - it's Teen Pop Magazine with Jonas Brothers on the cover]
191,13,1,Eric Cartman,"""Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! [throws the magazine to the floor]"
192,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!"
193,13,1,Stan Marsh,"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! [he and Cartman leave. Kyle stays in place a while, then walks back to Kenny, patting him on the back]"
194,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. [runs off to catch up with the other two boys. Kenny is left caressing the DVD]"
195,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah...)
196,13,1,Announcer,"(Off-Screen) Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver."
197,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys. [the girls in the audience begin to shriek. Each of the brothers holds a mic]
198,13,1,Joe,Hello.
199,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,"Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys."
200,13,1,Joe,"Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel."
201,13,1,Mickey Mouse,[in the control tent with an engineer] In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D.
202,13,1,Kevin,"Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D. [the girls shriek again]"
203,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,"Now, guys, a lot has been made about your ""purity rings"". Can you tell us about those?"
204,13,1,Joe,"Well. Um. [Joe holds up his left hand, palm in, to show off his ring. His brothers do the same seconds later] We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy."
205,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha. [the engineer responds]"
206,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,"That's wonderful, boys. [the camera zooms in on Joe's left ring finger, on which his purity ring rests] It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?"
207,13,1,Nick,Uh huh.
208,13,1,Joe,Yeah. Uh huh.
209,13,1,Kevin,Yeah.
210,13,1,Nick,Yeah.
211,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,Well can you give our audience a peek? [to the audience] What do you say girls? Do you want the Jonas Brothers to douse you with their white foam? [the girls shriek again. The brothers whip out some high-pressure hoses with bags of foam attached to them and proceed to spray the audience with streams of white foam. One of their songs plays in the background]
212,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Oh boy! This is TV gold, haha. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman enter the street and make their way through the audience]"
213,13,1,Stan Marsh,Excuse us. Excuse us.
214,13,1,Girl 2,"Hey, what do you think you're doing?!"
215,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,"That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?"
216,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!"
217,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!"
218,13,1,Joe,Huh?
219,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
220,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[takes notice] Who the hell are these guys? [takes off his shades and tosses them aside] Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?"
221,13,1,Eric Cartman,This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by [a dart strike him in the neck and knocks him out quick] teh- ...tehhhh [falls on his face]
222,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman?
223,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha! [drops a dart into a blowpipe]"
224,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, who the hell did that? [a dart hits him in the neck] Hwa? [another one hits Kyle in the neck]"
225,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,D'ow... [they both fall over unconscious.]
226,13,1,Voice 1,"Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!"
227,13,1,Voice 2,Get another mic on that drum kit!
228,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha? [walks up and gets in the boy's face] Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha. [the boy is alert now] Who do you work for? DreamWorks? [cut to a wide shot revealing a disheveled Stan being held up by his hat. Nearby, Cartman and Kyle are still unconscious.] Answer me, haha!"
229,13,1,Stan Marsh,We... don't work for anybody.
230,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[lets Stan's head drop to the floor] Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha. [Cartman wakes up. Kyle stirs] You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha."
231,13,1,Eric Cartman,The hell did you do to us?!
232,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"SHUT UP! [kicks Cartman in the balls, making him sit on his ass] Haha."
233,13,1,Announcer,"And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular! [the graphic says ""the 3D Concert Experience""] Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado! [the young girl fans are there cheering and wearing 3-D glasses]"
234,13,1,Male Host,Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!
235,13,1,Female Host,"In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling ""the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia."""
236,13,1,Blonde Girl and her Da-da,"Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?"
237,13,1,Father Maxi,"Not yet, Katie."
238,13,1,Male Host,Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.
239,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[depressed] (And not getting a blowjob...)
240,13,1,Male Host,We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.
241,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"You'd better start talkin', haha! [Stan covers his face, then removes his hands] You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!"
242,13,1,Stan Marsh,We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
243,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
244,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!"
245,13,1,Joe,You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
246,13,1,Kevin,We've all angered God.
247,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[walks up to them with the chainsaw and revs it up against the boys, who cringe a bit] You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha! [throws the chainsaw aside] You three faggots are going onstage, and [points at the boys] YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody [Kyle notices he's next to the mic control desk and surreptitiously turns up the Mic 1 slider] fuck this up! [this causes Mickey's voice to be heard by the audience, who quiet down] Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?! [Cartman sees the curtain control button and presses it. The curtain rises revealing Mickey Mouse to the audience] Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha. [Mickey is facing the boys, so he doesn't notice anything happening behind him yet] They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha. [having heard his own echo, he blanches and turns around. He now sees the audience] Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks."
248,13,1,Audience,BOOO!!
249,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers."
250,13,1,Joe,Come on guys. [the brothers turn left and walk offstage and the booing continues]
251,13,1,Mickey Mouse,No! Stop! Bring them back here!
252,13,1,Roadie,"It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out."
253,13,1,Mickey Mouse,NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH! [Mickey suddenly blows up to a height of some 40 feet and starts breathing fire on the audience. The girls scatter]
254,13,1,Father Maxi,[walks up to the TV and turns it off] That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.
255,13,1,Reporter,"Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit."
256,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[floating over the city like a Thanksgiving Day float] Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha."
257,13,1,Reporter,"The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed. [Kenny offers Tammy the Grey's Anatomy DVD, but she looks at her purity ring]"
258,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring."
259,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
260,13,1,Tammy Warner,"No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken."
261,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??) [throws away the DVD] (Really?)
262,13,1,Tammy Warner,Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
263,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. Screw this crap!) [as one they take off their rings and throw them to the floor and hug each other]
264,13,1,Tammy Warner,Oh I feel better already!
265,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Me too!)
266,13,1,Tammy Warner,What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?
267,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[jumps for joy] (Woo-hoo!!) [takes her hand and runs out the door with her]
268,13,1,Father Maxi,"And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world..."
269,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[during the eulogy] I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said."
270,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, now we know."
271,13,1,Eric Cartman,And knowing is half the battle.
