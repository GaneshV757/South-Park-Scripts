0,7,10,Father Maxi,"Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver. [the four boys are shown in their funeral best]"
1,7,10,Eric Cartman,"[yawns] Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring."
2,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[jabs Cartman and says in hushed tones] You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!"
3,7,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly."
4,7,10,Father Maxi,"It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple ""man walks into a bar"" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again. [screeching tires are heard]"
5,7,10,Mr Garrison,[rushing into the crowd] Look out!! [everyone turns to see. An elderly driver approaches them]
6,7,10,Elderly Driver,"[somewhat short, nearsighted] Huh? Was that a stop sign back there? [the banner recedes behind him. Everyone screams and the driver begins mowing people down. He crashes into a light standard at the other end of the market] Ooooh, I think I hit a pothole."
7,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?"
8,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue."
9,7,10,Stan Marsh,But they kill people.
10,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away."
11,7,10,Marvin Marsh,[enters in his motorized wheelchair] I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! [stops at his place at table]
12,7,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oooh, Hi Dad."
13,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"[to Randy] I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!"
14,7,10,Randy Marsh,Yes Dad.
15,7,10,Marvin Marsh,And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
16,7,10,Randy Marsh,Yes I know.
17,7,10,Marvin Marsh,And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!
18,7,10,Stan Marsh,"I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die."
19,7,10,Elderly Man,"Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet!"
20,7,10,Mona,"No, but it's the shortest. I save the most gas that way. [back at the pond the fisherman casts his line and looks back at the car]"
21,7,10,Elderly Man,You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!
22,7,10,Mona,"Less miles means less gas, you old fool. [back at the pond the fisherman catches something and is reeling it in, but looks at the car in doing so]"
23,7,10,Elderly Man,There's Country Kitchen right there!
24,7,10,Mona,Where?
25,7,10,Elderly Man,"Right there! You're gonna miss it! [the woman steps hard on the brake and spins the car out of control. The fisherman is about to put his catch into his little boat. The car smashes through the guard rail over a bridge and lands directly on the fisherman, killing him.]"
26,7,10,Mona,Is this the parking lot?
27,7,10,Elderly Man,I think so.
28,7,10,News Anchor,"Another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, who were trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in Deer Creek, where three construction workers and a bulldozer [shown] were run down by senior citizen Paul Thom [shown, irate], who was trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public outcry is forcing the DMV to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy, though no decision has yet to be made."
29,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!"
30,7,10,Seniors,[randomly] Yeah!
31,7,10,Elderly Woman 1,[rises] I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
32,7,10,Elderly Man 1,"[waving his cane] We need to let everyone know we're pissed off, and we're not gonna take it anymore!"
33,7,10,Seniors,"[randomly] Yeah! Yeah! That's right, Pete!"
34,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about? [everyone seems to have lost a clue] Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-"
35,7,10,Elderly Woman 2,[rises] Oooo. Was it the kids skateboarding on the sidewalks? No? [sits down]
36,7,10,Elderly Man 2,"[seated behind a walker] Oh, I remember! They're gonna take our licenses away!"
37,7,10,Seniors,"[randomly, suddenly animated] Yeah! Yeah! That's right!"
38,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!"
39,7,10,Seniors,"[randomly] Me too! Yeah, that's right! And mine too!"
40,7,10,Elderly Woman 1,I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
41,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"So now, what are we gonna do about it?"
42,7,10,Elderly Man 3,Do about what?
43,7,10,Elderly Woman 3,They're gonna take our licenses away.
44,7,10,Elderly Woman 1,They are?? They can't do that! [brief argument ensues]
45,7,10,Marvin Marsh,That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!
46,7,10,Elderly Man 3,"Great idea, Marvin!"
47,7,10,Elderly Woman 4,"Wait, ah I think we're having that meeting right now."
48,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"...Oh, right, this is the meeting."
49,7,10,Elderly Man 4,Right. To get those damn kids to stop skateboarding on the sidewalks!
50,7,10,Seniors,[randomly] Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's gotta stop them!
51,7,10,Randy Marsh,"[steps into the kitchen] Sharon, have you seen Dad?"
52,7,10,Sharon Marsh,"He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center."
53,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Oh. [steps back out] Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out..."
54,7,10,Sharon Marsh,Every senior in town will be driving home...
55,7,10,Randy Marsh,[with rising alarm] At the same time. [closeup] Oh My God!
56,7,10,Randy Marsh,Get inside! Get inside! [people begin taking heed] Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! [everyone moves off the streets in panic]
57,7,10,Someone,Oh my Goddd!
58,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"[amid the crowd] All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime."
59,7,10,Elderly Woman 1,"So long, everybody."
60,7,10,Elderly Man 5,"Goodbye, Missy. [other seniors say their goodbyes. They drive off slowly, some bumping into other cars on their way out]"
61,7,10,Randy Marsh,Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving! [everyone runs off in a panic. Randy finds Gerald and grabs him] Gerald! Where are the boys?!
62,7,10,Gerald Broflovski,We've gotta get out of here!
63,7,10,Randy Marsh,"The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!"
64,7,10,Gerald Broflovski,"They, they're... they're playing street hockey!"
65,7,10,Randy Marsh,[closeup] Oh My God!! [lets Gerald go and runs off]
66,7,10,Eric Cartman,"[providing his own play-by-play] With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again [the ball bounces off Cartman's girth], proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!"
67,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
68,7,10,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
69,7,10,Randy Marsh,"[in the distance] GET OFF THE STREETS! [Cartman perks up a bit] GET OFF THE STREETS! [the other boys listen, then turn to face the source of the sound]"
70,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look!"
71,7,10,Randy Marsh,[running across empty fields] GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
72,7,10,Stan Marsh,What is that?
73,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
74,7,10,Randy Marsh,[coming closer] GET OFF... GET OFF THE STREET!
75,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, is that your dad?"
76,7,10,Stan Marsh,I think so.
77,7,10,Eric Cartman,Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
78,7,10,Randy Marsh,-STREETS!! OFF-
79,7,10,Stan Marsh,What is he saying?
80,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,I can't understand him.
81,7,10,Randy Marsh,GAAAAAH!!
82,7,10,Eric Cartman,[slowly] Calm down! We cannot understand you!
83,7,10,Kenny McCormick,"[Looks to his right] (Ohhhhh, look!) [a phalanx of slow-moving cars cruises down the street towards them] (You guys!)"
84,7,10,Stan Marsh,Oh! [drops his hockey stick and holds his hands to his face]
85,7,10,Eric Cartman,Old people!
86,7,10,Randy Marsh,"[scoops them up and away] Come on! [the cars get closer, Randy and the boys head for a an abandoned lodge]"
87,7,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, they're coming! [the other boys mutter other things]"
88,7,10,Randy Marsh,Get over there! Stay low! [the boys go to the far wall and turn around]
89,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,Why are they all out driving at the same time?
90,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Shhhh! [lowers the blinds, closed them, and peeks out. Seeing nothing, he closes the blinds and sighs in relief] It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find- [a blue car crashes through the large picture window the blinds were covering and stops. Randy jumps in alarm] AWWWW!!"
91,7,10,Elderly Driver,[a man] I don't remember there being a building here.
92,7,10,Randy Marsh,"RUN! [they all gather at a corner, but another car crashes through the wall]"
93,7,10,Elderly Passenger,"[a woman] I told you to turn left, Larry."
94,7,10,Randy Marsh,Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! [he and the boys run up the stairs]
95,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,Aah! There's another one!
96,7,10,Randy and the Boys,AAAHH!!
97,7,10,Elderly Driver,"[follows them up the stair in her car] Excuse me, is this Costello Avenue? [Randy and the boys reach the second floor]"
98,7,10,Randy Marsh,"In here! [Randy opens a door and a bloody body drops down, dangling by its feet. They move on to the next room and close the door]"
99,7,10,Eric Cartman,They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
100,7,10,Randy Marsh,Quiet! Keep quiet! [a few seconds of silence pass]
101,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I'm scared."
102,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. [looks for a light switch to flip on]"
103,7,10,Stan Marsh,I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
104,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. [finds the switch and flips them on, revealing a car]"
105,7,10,Elderly Driver,How the hell did we get up here?
106,7,10,Randy and the Boys,AAAAAAAHH!! [quickly exit the room]
107,7,10,Elderly Passenger,I told you this was the wrong way!
108,7,10,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage."
109,7,10,DMV Official,"[seated in the middle, takes a license from an elderly man] Alrighty. [cuts it in two and drops the halves into a box]  There we go. Next? [a fat elderly lady approaches, then the elderly man with the walker]"
110,7,10,Elderly Man 2,It ain't right what you're doin'! I never had an accident in my life!
111,7,10,Elderly Woman 6,That's right. You shouldn't punish all of us. [the senior with the walker leaves the table]
112,7,10,DMV Official,"We're sorry, but this is the only way to be sure. Next please. [cuts up another license] There we go."
113,7,10,Elderly Man 6,But how am I supposed to get to the grocery store? Or the pharmacy to buy medicine?
114,7,10,DMV Official,"Well, maybe you should be in a nursing home. Hmmm?"
115,7,10,Elderly Man 7,Some of us would rather die!
116,7,10,DMV Official,"Well, we can certainly help you with that, too."
117,7,10,Elderly Woman 7,We aren't second-class citizens!
118,7,10,Elderly Man 8,"That's right! You can take our licenses, but you'll never take our pride!"
119,7,10,An Elderly Man,Yeah...
120,7,10,Eric Cartman,"Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?"
121,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around."
122,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving."
123,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!"
124,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[to the other boys] Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside."
125,7,10,Eric Cartman,"My God, he's right. [the boys climb in, strap themselves in, and Cartman offers a quick prayer] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death. [Marvin starts up the car and groans a bit] Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys. [a few moments later] Except for you, Kyle."
126,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Okay, all set? [he backs out of the a driveway, and an oncoming car honks at him. The driver screams something at him. Pretty soon, other cars and trucks are doing their best to avoid him. Cars begin crashing and flying through the air. The boys wince at every accident]"
127,7,10,Kenny McCormick,(Oooooo my God!) [a police cruiser catches up to them]
128,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa."
129,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Eh? [signals to the officer] Go around. Go around, you moron!"
130,7,10,Officer Barbrady,"Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!"
131,7,10,Eric Cartman,I believe that's us... thank God. [Marvin pulls over to the side and stops. Barbrady stops as well and approaches the driver side.]
132,7,10,Officer Barbrady,"Could I see your license, please?"
133,7,10,Marvin Marsh,I ain't got one! You peckers took it!
134,7,10,Officer Barbrady,"Well then, I have to take you to jail."
135,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!"
136,7,10,Marvin Marsh,Stupid son of a- God damnit!
137,7,10,Officer Barbrady,"I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh."
138,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!"
139,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!"
140,7,10,Randy Marsh,"You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!"
141,7,10,Marvin Marsh,Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.
142,7,10,Randy Marsh,"We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm? [wags his left index finger at Marvin] Who's the sorry-sorry?"
143,7,10,Marvin Marsh,Kiss my sagging ass!
144,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!"
145,7,10,Marvin Marsh,Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!
146,7,10,Stan Marsh,What's that?
147,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right! [points to Randy] And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!"
148,7,10,Mr Garrison,"And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a ""Mongol,"" not to be confused with a ""mongoloid"" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what [notices something outside and goes to the window, his voice fading off] the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid..."
149,7,10,Mr Garrison,[What he sees is elderly paratroopers drifting down onto the school grounds. The kids' eyes follow him and then the kids gather at the window with him] That's odd. [the AARP has landed] Those ROTC guys are way off course. [the paratroopers open their cargo boxes and unload some firearms]
150,7,10,Eric Cartman,More old people!
151,7,10,Stan Marsh,The American Association of Retired Persons.
152,7,10,Mr Garrison,"Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back."
153,7,10,AARP leader,Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team to Point Delta!
154,7,10,AARP member 1,[a heavyset woman] Bravo Team is go.
155,7,10,AARP member 2,[a light-skinned black man] Move! Move! Move!
156,7,10,AARP member 3,[a woman in purple dress] Let's go! Let's go! [Mr. Garrison comes out to meet them.]
157,7,10,Mr Garrison,"Uh, can I help you folks find something? [the woman smacks him across the face with the butt of her semi-automatic.] Oowww! [goes down in pain on one knee. The seniors begin firing away, with rifles, semi-automatics, whatever. The kids look on and gasp]"
158,7,10,Eric Cartman,Old people gone mad!
159,7,10,AARP member,"[woman wearing a flower-design dress] Contact. [quickly aims her machine gun at Randy] Put your hands up, young man!"
160,7,10,AARP leader,Marvin Marsh?
161,7,10,Marvin Marsh,[turns around] Yes?
162,7,10,AARP leader,"I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP. Hu-we've come to help the seniors in this town fight back."
163,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill."
164,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart",Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We just had to stop by Country Kitchen Buffet first.
165,7,10,AARP leader,[a black man] It's the nursing home! Liberate our comrades!
166,7,10,Male Nurse,"There now, Mr. Johnson. [wheels a senior across the room] We can go to the cafeteria and get you some creamed corn and toast. [the front doors swing open and the nurse stops in his tracks. The AARP members swarm in] Can I help you?"
167,7,10,AARP leader,"Help this! [jams the butt of his gun into the nurse, and the nurse falls.] The revolution is on, brother! [hands Mr. Johnson a semi-automatic] We're taking control of the town!"
168,7,10,Mr Johnson,"Well, alright, well it's about damn time! [addresses the nursing home residents] Hey everyone, we're taking the town. [other seniors look at him and express their approval]"
169,7,10,AARP member,"[enters with the black leader] Seniors, we're taking the town over."
170,7,10,AARP leader,The revolution is on! [walks away]
171,7,10,Elderly Woman,The revolution?
172,7,10,Elderly Man,"Oh, I'd better get my other sweater. [goes to change while the others leave the room]"
173,7,10,A Nurse,"[distributing weapons] Mrs. Wyland, seniors are taking over the town. Would you like a gun?"
174,7,10,Mrs Wyland,"Oh, I suppose so."
175,7,10,Randy Marsh,What the hell is going on?!
176,7,10,AARP member,Shut your piehole and get over there! [Randy joins Gerald and other adult hostages]
177,7,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Randy, what is this?"
178,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart",Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!
179,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!"
180,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Dad, what are you doing??"
181,7,10,Marvin Marsh,The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!
182,7,10,Elderly Woman,"[in dark-blue dress] Yeah, and we're gonna ask for more money in Medi-Care, too!"
183,7,10,AARP leader,[black] That's right.
184,7,10,Elderly Man,Yeah.
185,7,10,Man in Vest,[handcuffed in front] Have you all got Alzheimer's? The-they're not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens.
186,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart","[puts hand to ear] Heh?? [lowers his hand] We'll tell them if they don't give us our demands, we'll start killin' hostages!"
187,7,10,Man in Vest,"Huh, right. They're gonna really believe that. [the elderly woman next to him simply lifts her gun and fires at the man point blank. The man falls down dead]"
188,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?"
189,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart","[puts hand to ear] Heh?? [lowers his hand] No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs!"
190,7,10,Randy Marsh,"This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!"
191,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!"
192,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station."
193,7,10,AARP member,Reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in Conifer.
194,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart","Good! Hell, us senior citizens could take over the entire country!"
195,7,10,AARP lookout,[a black woman] We've got company! [the military arrives]
196,7,10,Tank Driver,[over a PA system] Attention seniors: lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over!
197,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart","Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business."
198,7,10,Mrs Applegate,"[holding an RPG launcher] All right. [fires the rocket and falls back from the recoil. The rocket heads for a Jeep full of troops. The troops scramble off. The rocket strikes and demolishes the Jeep, killing one of the soldiers]"
199,7,10,Tank Driver,What do you want?
200,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart",[puts hand to ear] Heh??
201,7,10,Marvin Marsh,We want our licenses back!
202,7,10,Other Seniors,Yeah!
203,7,10,Elderly Woman,That's right. And we want more money in Medi-Care!
204,7,10,Other Seniors,Yeah!
205,7,10,Elderly Man,And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk!
206,7,10,Other Seniors,Yeah!
207,7,10,Stan Marsh,Hey Dad.
208,7,10,Randy Marsh,[runs to the fence] Stan! Boys! You're safe!
209,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?"
210,7,10,Randy Marsh,"They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!"
211,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
212,7,10,Randy Marsh,"[exasperated] Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!"
213,7,10,Stan Marsh,"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?"
214,7,10,Randy Marsh,"No, son. We... like to sleep in."
215,7,10,An Elderly Woman,"Two hostages come front and center! [Randy looks back, alarmed]."
216,7,10,Randy Marsh,"They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!! [the boys turn and leave] Boys, avenger me! AVENGE ME!!"
