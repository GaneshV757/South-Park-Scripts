0,7,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen."
1,7,14,Eric Cartman,Right. What are we playing again?
2,7,14,Stan Marsh,Football.
3,7,14,Eric Cartman,Got it. [the teams get into position]
4,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay. 23! [Bebe appears behind him and taps him on the shoulder] Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! [Bebe taps him on the shoulder again. Stan turns and looks at her]"
5,7,14,Bebe Stevens,Wendy breaks up.
6,7,14,Stan Marsh,What? [looks let down]
7,7,14,Bebe Stevens,Wendy breaks up with you. [turns to walk away. Stan looks on for a few seconds]
8,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[moves forth to hold her up] Oh whoa, wait a minute. [Bebe turns around] What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  [This gets the other boys' attention]"
9,7,14,Bebe Stevens,She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. [the other boys turn to see what's going on]
10,7,14,Eric Cartman,"What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!"
11,7,14,Bebe Stevens,"Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!"
12,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!"
13,7,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeh-heah, right!"
14,7,14,Bebe Stevens,"God, you're so stupid! [turns around and walks away]"
15,7,14,Eric Cartman,What a whore! [turns around and goes back to the game. The other boys do the same. Stan is too stunned to move]
16,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up! [The boys get back into their playing positions. A few moments Kyle looks back] Stan? [Clyde looks back, then Cartman]"
17,7,14,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Come on, Stan, it's first down still. [Butters looks back, then Kenny. Stan loses heart and walks off slowly, his head hanging low. The other boys look at each other, unsure what to make of that. A montage begins.]"
18,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?"
19,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,[not looking up] Why?
20,7,14,Stan Marsh,'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
21,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework."
22,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[pleading] Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?"
23,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[puts his book down and sighs] God damn it! [walks over to Wendy, but avoids eye contact] Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. [Wendy turns around]"
24,7,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him."
25,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"'Kay. [walks back to Stan, but avoids looking at him, as well] She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you."
26,7,14,Stan Marsh,What? That's no answer! [nudges him a bit] Go tell her to be more direct with me.
27,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[goes for his books and picks them up] No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. [walks off. Jimmy appears]"
28,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, this is my life. [points at Jimmy] Jimmy!"
29,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,Hey Stan.
30,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?"
31,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
32,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her, [thinks] tell her... [gestures] she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me."
33,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,She's what?
34,7,14,Stan Marsh,She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
35,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"...Okay. [walks over to Wendy] Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wendy. [she turns around with her books]"
36,7,14,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah?
37,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Stan says you're a cont...[pronouncing as ""cunt""]  you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-"
38,7,14,Wendy Testaburger,Well tell Stan to fuck off!! [closes her locker and runs away]
39,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"-cont- You're a cont-tinuing source of inspiration to him. [his mission done, he returns to Stan]"
40,7,14,Stan Marsh,Well?
41,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. [hangs his head for emphasis, then walks off]"
42,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Over? [walks away dejected. He's next seen in bed, a blanket hung across his window blocking out the outside light. He has his sheets drawn up tight against his chin. A few moments later, Kyle enters with Butters, Cartman, Jimmy and Kenny. Kyle studies his friend.] Jesus..."
43,7,14,Butters Stotch,"We came over to cheer you up, Stan!"
44,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[softly, creaking] ...Go away."
45,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live."
46,7,14,Stan Marsh,Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
47,7,14,Eric Cartman,"God, what a fag!"
48,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, not now! [Cartman looks down, embarrassed]"
49,7,14,Stan Marsh,"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken..."
50,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Jeez, he's worse than I thought."
51,7,14,Butters Stotch,Well what do we do now?
52,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
53,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
54,7,14,Butters Stotch,What's Raisins?
55,7,14,Blonde,"Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of you? [smiles and grabs some menus from the counter] Right over here. [leads the boys to their table]"
56,7,14,Redhead,[waits at a table] So you guys having a good time today?
57,7,14,Diners,"[Table 1, say, enthralled] Uh huh..."
58,7,14,Blonde 2,"[waits at the next table] How about some more fun fries, guys?"
59,7,14,Diners,"[Table 2, enthralled] Okay... [the waitress at the other end of the table smiles]"
60,7,14,Brunette,"[at the same table] Boy, am I glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool."
61,7,14,Blonde,"[leaving them at their table] Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you."
62,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?"
63,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven."
64,7,14,Butters Stotch,This place is awesome!
65,7,14,Eric Cartman,How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
66,7,14,Lexus,[with flyaway light brown hair] Hey guys.
67,7,14,Butters Stotch,Whoa!
68,7,14,Lexus,How are we doing this afternoon?
69,7,14,The Boys,Good.
70,7,14,Lexus,"I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool."
71,7,14,Butters Stotch,[amazed] W-we are.
72,7,14,Lexus,So what can I get you?
73,7,14,Eric Cartman,"Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts [Lexus winks at Butters] and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade."
74,7,14,Lexus,"Great. I'll put your order in right now. [strokes Butters' shoulders, which sends shivers of excitement through his body]"
75,7,14,Butters Stotch,"You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?"
76,7,14,Lexus,"[near the kitchen] Raisins, girls! [sends an order along a conveyor to the kitchen staff]"
77,7,14,Blonde 3,Woohoo!
78,7,14,Redhead,Oh Yeah!
79,7,14,Brunette 2,[farther away] Do it!
80,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh? [a Raisins girl walks by with long black hair] Why don't you say hi to her? [calls out] Excuse me? [motions for her to come over]"
81,7,14,Brunette 3,[walks back and to the table] Hi guys. My name's Porsche.
82,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. Uh, this is Stan."
83,7,14,Porsche,"Oh hey cutie. How are you? I love your hat. I used to have a hat juuust like that, except, it was black and it didn't have a puffball on it. Oh my God, my hands are sooo cold. How come people have hands, anyway? Did you ever wonder that? [Stan looks more and more miserable with every word coming out of her mouth.]"
84,7,14,Raisins Girls,YMCA... [they make the hand signs for the letters. The rest of the diners look over at them and cheer them on] YMCA-A.
85,7,14,Eric Cartman,"[really stuffed, with a soiled face] Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... [their meals have been served]"
86,7,14,Porsche,"[still regaling Stan, who hasn't touched his food] Have you ever noticed how much sand there is at the beach? I mean, haven't you ever wondered where all this sand came from? Omigod, this one time, I saw a beetle that was thiiis big. Eeewww!"
87,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Can we go, please?"
88,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. Okay, come on you guys. [they all hop off their seats and walk off]"
89,7,14,Porsche,"Oooh my God, thank you guys sooo much for coming to Raisins! [Butters is last to leave]"
90,7,14,Lexus,"[sees him and stalls him] Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?"
91,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go."
92,7,14,Lexus,"Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??"
93,7,14,Butters Stotch,When do you wanna see me?
94,7,14,Lexus,[holds on to him] As soon as possible!
95,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. [hands her the bill]"
96,7,14,Lexus,"Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu! [comes around and gives him a full embrace]"
97,7,14,Butters Stotch,[hugs her back] Waa... ahaaah... [the other boys arrive at the entrance]
98,7,14,Raisins Girl,"Bye, guys! Thanks for coming to Raisins!"
99,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?"
100,7,14,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, I feel worse!"
101,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there."
102,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!"
103,7,14,Butters Stotch,[catches up to the other boys] She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
104,7,14,Stan Marsh,I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! [turns and opens one of the doors]
105,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing?
106,7,14,Stan Marsh,Something I should have done a long time ago. [walks out the door and into the night]
107,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now! [Bebe rolls her eyes and sighs] All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!"
108,7,14,Bebe Stevens,"Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of."
109,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[thinks] Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?"
110,7,14,Bebe Stevens,"If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play [closes her eyes] Peter Gabriel."
111,7,14,Lexus,"Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes."
112,7,14,Butters Stotch,[approaches] Lexus! [she takes a few steps back]
113,7,14,Lexus,"Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie."
114,7,14,Butters Stotch,I waited all night for you to get off work.
115,7,14,Lexus,"Oh, really? [takes a few more steps back] Huhunh, that's great. Uhm, Maury..."
116,7,14,Butters Stotch,I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
117,7,14,Raisins Bouncer Maury,[a huge bouncer] There a problem?
118,7,14,Lexus,Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
119,7,14,Raisins Bouncer Maury,Right. [steps up behind her and shoves Butters aside. He keeps his arm in place so Butters doesn't get any closer to Lexus]
120,7,14,Lexus,"[to Butters] Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? [moves forward, with Maury close behind]"
121,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present."
122,7,14,Lexus,"[stops and grabs it] Oh wow. Thanks, cutie."
123,7,14,Butters Stotch,"It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. [tries to get closer, but Maury holds him back]"
124,7,14,Lexus,"Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you. [reaches her bike] Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? [unlocks her bike from its post]"
125,7,14,Butters Stotch,"[tries to get closer, but Maury him back] Well yeah, but, but, hey, [tries to get closer, but Maury him back] hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime."
126,7,14,Lexus,"Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? [Maury helps her on to her bike]"
127,7,14,Butters Stotch,O-kay!
128,7,14,Lexus,"Bye, cutie!"
129,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Bye, bye darling! [Maury turns and goes back to the restaurant. Butters holds his hands over his heart] Wow... a real-life relationship."
130,7,14,Mr Garrison,"[sternly] All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. [the boys break up and head to their lockers. Stan remains on a bench on his back, alone, with just a towel and his hat on]"
131,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[returns] Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball."
132,7,14,Stan Marsh,[with emotion in his voice] I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
133,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?"
134,7,14,Stan Marsh,There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
135,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!"
136,7,14,Stan Marsh,Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
137,7,14,Pete,"[with black puffy, feathery hair, streaked in red] Life is pain. Life is only pain. [his hair falls over his right eye, he jerks his head back to put it back in place] We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back] But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back] eats at your soul."
138,7,14,Michael,"[dressed in something like a tuxedo, sporting a curly pompadour] Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?"

141,7,14,Stan Marsh,"But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?"
142,7,14,Pete,"Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back]"
143,7,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, so how do I join you?"
144,7,14,Michael,"If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do."
145,7,14,Stan Marsh,...'K.
146,7,14,Mercedes,"Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you."
147,7,14,Ferrari,Okay.
148,7,14,Mercedes,"First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. ""Hey,  cutie."" [waves and winks] When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun. [they stop by a wooden bucket] We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins. [they leave the bucket] Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. ""Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in."" If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. ""I'll be right back with your order, guys."" [holds Ferrari's shoulder]"
149,7,14,Ferrari,"Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes."
150,7,14,Mercedes,"Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck. [Ferrari walks off] Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!"
151,7,14,Porsche,"Okay! [opens the doors and Butters bolts in, quite excitedly]"
152,7,14,Raisins Girl,"Hi, welcome to Raisins!"
153,7,14,Butters Stotch,Hi! Is Lexus here?
154,7,14,Lexus,"Hey, cutie."

178,7,14,Lexus,Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
179,7,14,Butters Stotch,Hey Lexus.
180,7,14,Lexus,"Hi, sweetie! Who's this?"
181,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Wuh it's me, Butters."
182,7,14,Lexus,"Oh, okay. Hi, cutie. [keeps an eye out for passing customers. Three boys walk by and she covers the phone's receiver] Hey sweetie. [lifts her hand from the receiver] So how are you, honey?"
183,7,14,Butters Stotch,"I'm fine. I miss you though. [lays on his back, getting comfortable] Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz. [shot of Lexus pouring lemonade into a pitcher] Sometimes I think our classes are too hard. [back to Butters' room] But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?"
184,7,14,Lexus,"Good, good."
185,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD."
186,7,14,Lexus,"Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie. [another Raisins girl comes with glasses to refill, Lexus ] Why don't you just come down to Raisins?"
187,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times."

194,7,14,Butters Stotch,Uh but I spent it all.
195,7,14,Linda Stotch,"What are you spending all that money on, Butters?"

208,7,14,Linda Stotch,"[hands him a bill] All right, you win."
209,7,14,Michael,"Hey, can we get more coffee over here?"
210,7,14,Benny's Waitress,"Damn it, are you kids just gonna sit here all night again and drink six dollars' work of coffee?! Why don't you get a life?! [walks away]"
211,7,14,Michael,"[bitterly] Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains."
212,7,14,Other Goths,Yeah.
213,7,14,Pete,"[to Stan] Dude, you haven't drank your coffee. [his hair falls over his face, he jerks his head back]"
214,7,14,Stan Marsh,Well I don't drink coffee.
215,7,14,Pete,You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. [Stan picks up his mug and drinks. Kyle enters the restaurant and approaches Stan's booth]
216,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!"
217,7,14,Stan Marsh,[sips some coffee] Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. [sips some coffee. Pete jerks his hair back into place]
218,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!"
219,7,14,Stan Marsh,So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
220,7,14,Pete,"Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole? [jerks his hair back into place] You just don't know what real pain is."
221,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!"
222,7,14,Pete,I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
223,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!"
224,7,14,Stan Marsh,What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
225,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. She is.
226,7,14,Stan Marsh,Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
227,7,14,"Goth Kids
 Henrietta Biggle
 Michael
 Pete
 Firkle",For sure.
228,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks away, defeated] Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable."
229,7,14,Stan Marsh,[sips some coffee] ...conformist.
230,7,14,Other Goths,Yeah.
231,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Here we are, Mom and Dad! [they enter, but his parents are immediately troubled by the setting]"
232,7,14,Mercedes,"Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?"
233,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her."
234,7,14,Mercedes,Great. [gets some menus] Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers. Right this way. [leads them to a table]
235,7,14,Raisins Girl,Who else wants a signed Raisins Girls calendar for five dollars? [the table she approaches cheers]
236,7,14,Diners,"Woohoo, all right, yeah! [the Stotches look around, amazed]"
237,7,14,Linda Stotch,"Stephen, what is this place?"
238,7,14,Stephen Stotch,"I, don't know."
239,7,14,Mercedes,[stops at a table] Here you go. Porsche will by right with you. [walks off]
240,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! [runs off. Stephen and Linda take their seats]"
241,7,14,Raisins Girl,"[blonde, to a boy at a table nearby] Hey cutie, you having a good time?"
242,7,14,Boy,Yeah.
243,7,14,Stephen Stotch,"Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money."
244,7,14,Linda Stotch,[holds her hands together] This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
245,7,14,Porsche,[arrives] Hi guys. Can I take your order?
246,7,14,Linda Stotch,"Little girl, you shouldn't be working here."
247,7,14,Porsche,I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be working?
248,7,14,Linda Stotch,"No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer."
249,7,14,Porsche,I could cure cancer? Omigod! That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.
250,7,14,Linda Stotch,"... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you."
251,7,14,Porsche,"Cool! [grins and hops off the stool, then carries it off. Butters arrives with Lexus, who carries a plate of chips]"
252,7,14,Butters Stotch,Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
253,7,14,Lexus,Hi. Welcome to Raisins.
254,7,14,Stephen Stotch,"Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?"
255,7,14,Butters Stotch,Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me [holds on to Lexus] you can say in front of Lexus.
256,7,14,Linda Stotch,"Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips."
257,7,14,Butters Stotch,Huh?
258,7,14,Stephen Stotch,"You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession."
259,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, I see. [gets angry] You don't approve of my girlfriend! [Lexus looks off and smiles at somebody] Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad! [walks away from the table with Lexus] Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!"
260,7,14,Lexus,"What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend."
261,7,14,Butters Stotch,"... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?"
262,7,14,Lexus,"I'm sorry, sweetie."
263,7,14,Butters Stotch,So that's it? We're broken up now?
264,7,14,Lexus,I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12. [walks off]
265,7,14,Butters Stotch,Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over. [walks off dejected] Our relationship is o-over.
266,7,14,Michael,Look at that. Another tortured soul.
267,7,14,Pete,Another life of pain. [Butters looks up to see the Goths. Stan isn't shown yet.]
268,7,14,Michael,"Hey Raven, check it out. [Stan, now named Raven, enters the picture]"
269,7,14,Stan Marsh,Butters?
270,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh [sniff, wipes away his tears] Uh hey, hey Stan."
271,7,14,Stan Marsh,What's the matter with you?
272,7,14,Butters Stotch,"[sobbing] Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me."
273,7,14,"Goth Kids
 Henrietta Biggle
 Michael
 Pete
 Firkle",Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
274,7,14,Butters Stotch,Yeah. [sniff] It sure does hurt.
275,7,14,Michael,That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.
276,7,14,Pete,Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
277,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life."
278,7,14,Stan Marsh,Huh? But you just got dumped.
279,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like, [sobs] it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid..."
280,7,14,Pete,Yeah.
281,7,14,Stan Marsh,"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all."
282,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. [walks off]"
283,7,14,Stan Marsh,"He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. [walks off]"
284,7,14,Michael,Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
285,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[prepares to receive the football] Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!"
286,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[arrives] Hey, can I join in? [the other boys turn around]"
287,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
288,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way. [Token and Wendy walk by at this point] Hey Wendy! [Token and Wendy look] You're a bitch,.. Token? [flips him off] Right here, buddy. [Token and Wendy walk off, insulted]"
289,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back."
290,7,14,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Let's play ball.
