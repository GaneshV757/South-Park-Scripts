0,7,9,Cartman,God dammit! [hangs his head and lets the mic stand fall into his left hand. All stop playing and the side door opens]
1,7,9,Randy Marsh,"[looks in] Stan, are you okay?"
2,7,9,Stan,"Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. [Cartman straightens up]"
3,7,9,Randy Marsh,"Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. [steps back and closes the door]"
4,7,9,Cartman,[cackling] Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
5,7,9,Kyle,"He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz."
6,7,9,Kenny,(What? Is it?)
7,7,9,Stan,"Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. [Cartman paces the floor with arms behind his back]"
8,7,9,Kyle,I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
9,7,9,Cartman,"[stops] Inspiration. Wait a minute, [turns right and walks away from them] that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?"
10,7,9,Stan,See what?
11,7,9,Cartman,[turns around] Our band should play Christian rock! [beams with pride]
12,7,9,Kyle,Christian rock?!
13,7,9,Cartman,"[races back to the band] Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!"
14,7,9,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!"
15,7,9,Cartman,"[protests, takes a step towards Kyle] It worked for Creed!"
16,7,9,Stan,I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
17,7,9,Cartman,"[steps towards Stan] You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!"
18,7,9,Kyle,"[pointing to an exit] Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!"
19,7,9,Cartman,Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
20,7,9,Kyle,"You're on, fat boy!"
21,7,9,Cartman,"Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! [runs out as fast as his fat little body will let him, and pants]"
22,7,9,Kyle,[after a few seconds of watching the door] What a stupid asshole!
23,7,9,Cartman,Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! [runs up to a house and pounds on the front door. The door opens up and it's Butters who answers]
24,7,9,Butters,"Oh, hi Eric."
25,7,9,Cartman,"Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! [dashes off]"
26,7,9,Butters,[watching Cartman run off] ...Ohhh!
27,7,9,Cartman,No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle! [pounds on the door and Token answers] Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! [turns around and dashes off]
28,7,9,Token,What?! We don't have a bass guitar.
29,7,9,Cartman,"[spins around] Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! [runs off. Token gets annoyed and shuts the door]"
30,7,9,Butters,"Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... inspiration."
31,7,9,Cartman,"Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. [makes changes to the sheet music on the piano's sheet music holder]"
32,7,9,Token,"[arrives with a bass and a small amplifier] Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement."
33,7,9,Cartman,"I told you, Token."
34,7,9,Token,"So, what are we doing?"
35,7,9,Cartman,"Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives."
36,7,9,Butters,Wow!
37,7,9,Cartman,We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
38,7,9,Butters,[his smile vanishes and he slumps in his chair] Awww.
39,7,9,Token,[moves towards the front door] I'm out. [picks up his amp]
40,7,9,Cartman,"Wait! [Token stops, Cartman rushes over] Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- [points to Butters]"
41,7,9,Butters,"Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars."
42,7,9,Cartman,"Still want to leave, Token? [Token thinks a bit, then resumes his place] Thank you."
43,7,9,Kyle,"[enters and stands before them] Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?"
44,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
45,7,9,Kyle,Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
46,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already."
47,7,9,Kyle,Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
48,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,It wasn't your life yesterday. [resumes reading]
49,7,9,Kyle,"Hold it. [plaintive] Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops."
50,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"The answer is no, Kyle."
51,7,9,Kyle,"Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!"
52,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, don't belittle your own people!"
53,7,9,Kyle,[turns and walks off in frustration] Aaaargh! [heads for the front door and opens it. Stan and Kenny approach the entrance. It's night out.]
54,7,9,Stan,Hey dude.
55,7,9,Kyle,It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
56,7,9,Stan,"No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!"
57,7,9,Kyle,Really?
58,7,9,Kenny,(Yeah!)
59,7,9,Stan,You got a computer?
60,7,9,Stan,"See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!"
61,7,9,Kyle,"All right, cool. [takes over] Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. [with each name, he clicks on some songs and a download indicator shows download progress for each one. It's an extremely fast connection]"
62,7,9,Kenny,(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
63,7,9,Stan,"Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too."
64,7,9,Kyle,"[types in the search box] Judas Priest. [a two-tone bell sound indicates a successful download] Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! [immediately, helicopters are heard coming and the light outside turns bright white. A night sun hovers overhead and stops at a position in which the helicopter pilots can see inside the den. Police sirens are then heard]"
65,7,9,Stan,What the hell is that?
66,7,9,Kyle,"I don't know. [drops from the bench and walks over to a window] Let me go check. [an FBI agent crashes through the window, falls and rolls into a standing position, then aims his firearm at the boys. The boys are startled and jump]"
67,7,9,Agent 1,Freeze!! FBI!! [a second agent crashes through the other window and rolls into position as well. A third agent leaps in through the second window]
68,7,9,Agent 2,Down on the ground! Down on the ground! [the boys are herded closer together. Three thumps are heard on the door and more agents break in with a battering ram.]
69,7,9,Agent 3,Hurry up! Let me see those hands! [the boys quickly raise their hands as more agents pour in. The boys are handcuffed]
70,7,9,Agent 2,[into his walkie-talkie] Tango Teamus to Point Bravo! Suspects in custody! [the boys are escorted out of the room]
71,7,9,Agent 4,"Move move move move move move! All clear, men! [to the boys] Get your ass going!"
72,7,9,Agent 5,Move move move move move move! Move!
73,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[appears at the door with Sheila] Kyle, what did you do?!"
74,7,9,Kyle,[being herded into an FBI van with the other boys] I don't know!
75,7,9,Cartman,"All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them. [some sheet music is shown. Cartman has already crossed out the original author's name] See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with [writes next to ""baby""] Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat. [Butters doesn't understand, but starts drumming. It's rather good] Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line."
76,7,9,Token,I don't know how to play bass. [Butters stops]
77,7,9,Cartman,"[Sighs, has his left fist on his forehead, eyes shut] Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass."
78,7,9,Token,I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
79,7,9,Cartman,"Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! [Token begins to play a bass line, then is surprised that he can actually do it, then realizes that Cartman is right]"
80,7,9,Token,God-damnit! [Butters joins in and their sounds flow together]
81,7,9,Cartman,"All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. [begins to sing]
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus."
82,7,9,Butters,Well done!
83,7,9,Kyle,"[some seconds later] Um, sir-"
84,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"Shut up!! [the boys jump in their seats, then look down, chagrined] You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downloaded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?"
85,7,9,Kyle,[rubs the table a bit] We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
86,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,[pissed off] Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your coats on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!
87,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica. [they approach a bush] Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool. [he's seen sitting on the edge of a chaise longue, his face in his hands, softly sobbing]"
88,7,9,Kyle,What's the matter with him?
89,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it."
90,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"[a close-up of Lars sobbing] Come. There's more. [leads them away. Next seen is a small airport at night] Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything? [a shot of Britney boarding a plane, then stopping to look at it before entering] Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free. [Britney gives a heavy sigh and goes inside.] The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?"
91,7,9,Kyle,"We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh..."
92,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"That is the folly of man. Now look in this window. [they are at another mansion, and they look inside a picture window] Here you see the loving family of Master P. [He's shown tossing a basketball to his wife while his kid tries to catch it] Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia. [his mom lowers the ball and gives it to the boy, who smiles, picks it up and drops it. It rolls away and he goes after it]"
93,7,9,Kyle,"So, he's gonna get it, right?"
94,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise."
95,7,9,Stan,"[apologetically] We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!"
96,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"[somberly, dramatically] Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury."
97,7,9,Cartman,"Almost there, you guys."
98,7,9,Butters,Ow...
99,7,9,Token,Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
100,7,9,Cartman,"Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover. [sets up his camera on a tripod] The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover."
101,7,9,Butters,"Wow, neato! An album cover! [walks out onto the sand]"
102,7,9,Token,"[follows Butters onto the sand] This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!"
103,7,9,Cartman,"[when Token seems out of earshot] I'm going to kill you one day, Token."
104,7,9,Token,[spins around] What did you say?! [Cartman is startled]
105,7,9,Cartman,"Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. [begins to focus the shot. Butters and Token stand together]"
106,7,9,Butters,Cheese!
107,7,9,Cartman,"No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! [Butters and Cartman move apart. Token moves off to a boulder a little farther away, Butters moves a bit closer to the camera]"
108,7,9,Butters,Cheese!
109,7,9,Cartman,"No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!"
110,7,9,Butters,Oh...
111,7,9,Cartman,"Token, look away to the right. [Token looks off to the right] More. [Token turns his head to the right] More!"
112,7,9,Token,[turns all his body to the right] Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
113,7,9,Cartman,"So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! [starts the timer, then steps into the shot] Our first album cover."
114,7,9,Cartman,"Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights."
115,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused."
116,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.
117,7,9,Stan,"Boy, I'll say!"
118,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees."
119,7,9,Randy Marsh,Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
120,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! [leads the parents away]"
121,7,9,Stan,"[walks off in the opposite direction] Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice."
122,7,9,Kenny,(Yeah)
123,7,9,Kyle,"No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!"
124,7,9,Stan,Oh yeah.
125,7,9,Kyle,"Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!"
126,7,9,Kenny,(Yeah!)
127,7,9,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week."
128,7,9,Cartman,[walks up] Oh hey guys. How's it going?
129,7,9,Kyle,"We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!"
130,7,9,Cartman,"[brushes off Kyle's comment] I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, [brings out the CD] Faith + 1, is about to go platinum."
131,7,9,Stan,It is?? [Kyle's jaw drops]
132,7,9,Cartman,"That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya! [tugs at one of the lobes on Kyle's hat] Hahahaha ha ha!"
133,7,9,Kyle,"You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!"
134,7,9,Cartman,"It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album."
135,7,9,Kyle,"You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!"
136,7,9,Stan,"Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity."
137,7,9,Cartman,"I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! [walks off]"
138,7,9,Kyle,Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
139,7,9,Stan,What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
140,7,9,Kenny,(Yeah.)
141,7,9,T Shirt Vendor,Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm!
142,7,9,Bible Vendor,Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.
143,7,9,Cartman,"Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually.."
144,7,9,Elderly Woman,"Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics."
145,7,9,Cartman,"[takes the woman's body and puts it in the treasurer's box] I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ."
146,7,9,Butters,"Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. [Cartman flashes an angry look at Butters. The woman looks deceived, but she takes the album with her anyway]"
147,7,9,Cartman,"Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off."
148,7,9,Announcers and MC,"[the boys look up] All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest 2003! [the boys leave their booth and enter the stadium] are you ready for some live music? [the crown inside begins to move]"
149,7,9,A Man,Yeah Jesus!
150,7,9,Announcers and MC,Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity! [the lights come up on them]
