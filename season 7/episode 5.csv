169,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like tacos, and burritos."
170,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,That? That's what replaced me?!
171,7,5,Cartman,I'm sure it was just a mistake.
172,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Only mistake was when this ghetto trash got signed in the first place!

250,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, Ben, I adore you! [Cartman looks at Ben's actions, then at what his hand is doing...]"
251,7,5,Cartman,"OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT! [opens his door, hops out, and walks away] WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!"
252,7,5,Ben,But I love her!

[a page brings ""her"" a bottle of water. ""Jennifer Lopez"" knocks it onto the floor] Not Evian, Pellegrino, you stupid beetch!"
258,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?"
259,7,5,Aide 2,"Uh, that's fine Ms. Lopez. Look, it's been a long night. Why don't we pick it up in the morning?"
260,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Fine my ass, cholo! [Cartman wakes up and looks at his hand] I'll tell you when it's fine!"
261,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Stupid idiots! How am I supposed to make an album with those cholos?! [a bat hits a car nearby]
262,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[stands next to the car she just bashed] You little snot-nose! [Cartman is taken aback] You ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?! [holds up the tabloid shown earlier]
263,7,5,Cartman,Aww crap.
264,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,You'd better stay away from him! [begins whacking away at Cartman's hand]
265,7,5,Cartman,OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
266,7,5,Dr Doctor,Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers.
267,7,5,Liane Cartman,Oh dear.
268,7,5,Dr Doctor,But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
269,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[on its own hospital bed, with wires attached] Ahhh Ahhhh [Cartman sits in a chair displeased]"
270,7,5,Cartman,"I told you this would happen. [Kyle, Stan and Kenny show up.]"
271,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, hello guys."
272,7,5,Kyle,"Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!"
273,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, Kyle, why you no like meee?"
274,7,5,Cartman,"Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck."
275,7,5,Kyle,I hate you. [turns right and walks out]
276,7,5,Liane Cartman,"Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest."
277,7,5,Cartman,"EHAGH! [next to him is Ben Affleck, naked and relaxed] Moooooommmm! [Ben wakes up]"
278,7,5,Liane Cartman,"[enters with a cup of coffee and wearing a pink robe] What is it, sweetie?"
279,7,5,Cartman,Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
280,7,5,Liane Cartman,"Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with you.[backs out of the room and closes the door.]"
281,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Buenos dias, my love."
282,7,5,Ben,"Good morning, baby."
283,7,5,Cartman,You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
284,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,He's not going anywhere! Ben and I were up all night making love.
285,7,5,Cartman,What? Oh- AWWW! [wipes his hand off on his pajamas] Ben Affleck's spooge!!
286,7,5,Ben,Should we tell him the news?
287,7,5,Cartman,What news?
288,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,I think we should tell him.
289,7,5,Ben,It's S'aright?
290,7,5,Cartman,S'aright.
291,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,S'aright.
292,7,5,Ben,We're getting married!!
293,7,5,Cartman,"Oh, balls!"
294,7,5,Kyle,Come in. [the bell rings again.] COME IN!! [Cartman enters wearing an oven mitt over his left hand.]
295,7,5,Cartman,"[sad] Guys, I need to talk to you."
296,7,5,Stan,What's the matter?
297,7,5,Cartman,"I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez."
298,7,5,Kyle,So stop doing it!
299,7,5,Cartman,Stop doing what?
300,7,5,Kyle,You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
301,7,5,Cartman,"Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and ""Jennifer Lopez"" emerges coughing]"
302,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Don't you dare ever do that to me again!
303,7,5,Kyle,"Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe!"
304,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!
305,7,5,Kyle,I can see your lips moving!
306,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"I can see your lips moving too, culo!"
307,7,5,Kyle,See?! I just saw your lips move!
308,7,5,Cartman,Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
309,7,5,Stan,What's she doing?
310,7,5,Kyle,"Come here! [drags Stan off to the dining room] You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!"
311,7,5,Stan,"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it."
312,7,5,Kyle,"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, [Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman] ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!"""
313,7,5,Stan,"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?"
314,7,5,Kyle,"YES, dude! [they then walk back into the living room]"
315,7,5,Stan,"Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you."
316,7,5,Cartman,"Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does."
317,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Oh no you don't!
318,7,5,Cartman,"Quiet, Ms. Lopez."
319,7,5,Kyle,Out! [walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out]
320,7,5,Cartman,"Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]"
321,7,5,Ben,"There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! [Cartman decides to run in the other direction] Jenny? [Cartman sees a car pull up in front of him and then...]"
322,7,5,Aide 1,"Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! [Cartman decides to ran back towards Ben, but runs into a pair of female legs]"
323,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[disheveled, wielding a running chainsaw over her head] So you're gettin' married, huh? [revs up the motor, and Cartman makes his escape, screaming. In the background, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny have stepped out the door to see what's going on.]"
324,7,5,Ben,Don't you hurt her!
325,7,5,BHI President and Aides,We'll sue you!
326,7,5,Kyle,Oh Jesus.
327,7,5,Police Officer 1,"Freeze, leafblower! [she drops the chainsaw and holds her hands up]"
328,7,5,Aide 1,Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! [the arrest is made]
329,7,5,Police Officer 2,"All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath."
330,7,5,Ben,"[rushes up to ""Jennifer Lopez""] Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!"
331,7,5,Aide 2,"Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive]"
332,7,5,Ben,Our love is like rain!
333,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"That's what you said about me, asshole!"
334,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Quiet!
335,7,5,BHI President and Aides,Get her out of here!
336,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Fuck you!
337,7,5,Police Officer 2,"Shut up, picante pants!"
338,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Everyone be quiet! [Everyone stops what they're doing and look at the hand] I'm... I'm not who you think I am.
339,7,5,BHI President and Aides,You're not?
340,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot continue anymore. I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am... [Cartman rips off the small wig he had on his hand and delivers a new voice] ...Mitch Connor. [everyone, including Kyle, gasps]"
341,7,5,Police Officer 2,Who's Mitch Connor?
342,7,5,Mitch Connor,"Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'."
343,7,5,Kyle,"[exasperated] Oh no, no, no."
344,7,5,Mitch Connor,"I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time."
345,7,5,Kyle,Stop. It.
346,7,5,Mitch Connor,"Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart. [Ben begins to sob. Cartman walks to one side of the bridge] But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down. I wonder, will I dream? [as the sun drops below the horizon, Cartman opens his hand and a gust of wind is heard. Whatever was possessing the hand parted. Ben sobs once more as Cartman just stares in wonder]"
347,7,5,Police Officer 2,"Well, looks like Mitch Connor has cashed in his last chips. [everyone disperses except the boys. Ben stays on for a second, but he too leaves.]"
348,7,5,Kyle,"[the boys step forward] Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?"
349,7,5,Cartman,"I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?"
350,7,5,Kyle,"[resigns] All right. [Cartman beams] All right, I guess it's possible."
351,7,5,Cartman,[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
352,7,5,Manager,"Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce will go on. [a man carrying a large bowl walks up behind Lopez and bumps into her]"
353,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[jumping to one side] Ow. Look out, muffinhead!"
354,7,5,Manager,"Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people."
355,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Get a what with who?
356,7,5,Manager,Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?
357,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[begins chopping the onions] This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working at a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!
358,7,5,Coworker,Yeah. Meee too.
359,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[as credits roll]
