0,7,3,Teacher,"[walks through the class] Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to feel the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice. Uh huh. [the boys still laugh at their monument]"
1,7,3,Eric Cartman,[laughing] Put more clay on the balls.
2,7,3,Teacher,[noticing] Boys! [they stop laughing as she points] What is that?
3,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,A reindeer?
4,7,3,Teacher,"You know, I've had it! You four boys never take art class seriously!"
5,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[retorts] What a crime. [the three others chuckle, then laugh out loud]"
6,7,3,Teacher,"[displeased, with arms crossed] You think art is not important?"
7,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads."
8,7,3,Butters Stotch,[pipes up] I love art class!
9,7,3,Stan Marsh,See?
10,7,3,Teacher,"[reaches for their creation and grabs it by the shaft] Do you think this is funny?! [shakes it around for effect] Do you think this is funny, huh?! [ends up looking at the head, as if she's about to suck on it. The boys cover their mouths to hold their laughter, knowing how she looks with their creation like that, but soon they burst out laughing. The teacher now cradles the project] Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery! [the laughter stops and the boys' jaws drop.]"
11,7,3,Eric Cartman,You can't do that!
12,7,3,Teacher,I certainly can! I'm your teacher!
13,7,3,Eric Cartman,You're an art teacher!
14,7,3,Teacher,Make it two hours!
15,7,3,Stan Marsh,Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool!
16,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,How dare she talk to us like that?!
17,7,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)"
18,7,3,Eric Cartman,We can't let her get away with this! [voicing dropping to almost a whisper] I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
19,7,3,Stan Marsh,Like what?
20,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house."
21,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
22,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,TP her house?
23,7,3,Eric Cartman,Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
24,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh.
25,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[sensing Kyle's reluctance] What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken? [begins strutting like a chicken and making chicken noises. Kyle kicks Cartman in the balls in anger] Ugh! [drops to his knees, then gets one leg up]"
26,7,3,Teacher,"Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished!"
27,7,3,Stan Marsh,"[glares back at her, then softly] Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!"
28,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[in pain] Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!"
29,7,3,Stan Marsh,D'you think that's enough?
30,7,3,Eric Cartman,Should be fine.
31,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
32,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay. [reaches behind the other boys and grabs something] Here we go, pack of chewing gum. [tosses it into the first cart. They approach the cash register]"
33,7,3,Cashier,Hello boys. Find everything you need?
34,7,3,Eric Cartman,Yep. All set.
35,7,3,Cashier,"[begins scanning the packages] Mkay', let's see here. Toilet paper [""beep"" $1.50 for a four-pack] Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] So, what are you kids up to tonight? [""beep""]"
36,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game."
37,7,3,Cashier,"Nice relaxing night at home, huh? Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] Aaand toilet paper [""beep."" He picks up the gum] Eh, hey. [holds up the gum] Now you kids be careful with this chewing gum. Don't go sticking it under tables."
38,7,3,Stan Marsh,Okay
39,7,3,Cashier,"Okay. Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep.""] You know, son, I remember you comin' in last week and buying this much toilet paper. [""beep""]"
40,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Heh yeah, that that's right."
41,7,3,Cashier,"... Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""]"
42,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?"
43,7,3,Eric Cartman,No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
44,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. [flashes disgust] Uuugh.
45,7,3,Stan Marsh,Is this the right house?
46,7,3,Eric Cartman,"It's the right address-wait! Look there! [the teacher prepares the dining-room table] There's Mrs. Streibel! This is the place. [loosens the drawstring on his back and lets the sides fall away. In the dining room, a boy and girl arrive and sit at table]"
47,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside."
48,7,3,Eric Cartman,So?
49,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
50,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, we all agreed to do this!"
51,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!"
52,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, you're being an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah. [takes out a roll and advances a bit] Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! [unleashes the first roll]"
53,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah! Fuck you!)
54,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on, let's go! [he and Kenny cross the road and drop down to a ditch on the other side. Stan follows]"
55,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,What have we done? [Stan looks back and gets Kyle]
56,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Let's go, Kyle! [drags him off. Kyle is transfixed for a bit, then turns to follow Stan. A last shot of the house, and then the boys reach their bus stop gasping for air.]"
57,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble."
58,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, that was sooo awesome! [smiles]"
59,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
60,7,3,Eric Cartman,Who cares??
61,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!"
62,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Me?? [takes a couple steps forward] There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. [Kyle blanches]"
63,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together."
64,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]"
65,7,3,Mrs Streibel,AAAAAAAAA!
66,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!"
67,7,3,The Streibel Girls,[crying] Mommy! Mommy!
68,7,3,Mr Streibel,[with her family around her] Whyyy? Whyyy?
69,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[wakes up, startled] Ah! Oh God! Oh God!"
70,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streibel's house got covered with toilet paper."
71,7,3,Clyde Donovan,Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
72,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her."
73,7,3,Butters Stotch,I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
74,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. [the bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with some books.]"
75,7,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now."
76,7,3,Eric Cartman,[snaps his fingers] Damn!
77,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God!
78,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
79,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine."
80,7,3,Stan Marsh,We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
81,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46."
82,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality
83,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Yes, dude!"
84,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??"
85,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, Ah I, ah I thought..."
86,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[exasperated] Oh, for Christ's sake!"
87,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody."
88,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Stan. [the doorknow begins to turn] Sh sh, here they come, here they come. [the door opens and Mr. Mackey appears] ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?"
89,7,3,Mr Mackey,"We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?"
90,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(Me??)
91,7,3,Mr Mackey,"Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k? [Kenny hops off and enters the office, and Mr. Mackey closes the door. The other boys' jaws drop a bit.]"
92,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Touch?, Mr. Mackey, touch?."
93,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Why are they doing us one at a time?
94,7,3,Eric Cartman,"They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal."
95,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,[brightens up] I can get a better deal?
96,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!"
97,7,3,Mr Streibel,"There we go. That should be about the last of it. [Officer Barbrady passes by with police tape, stretching it out from tree to tree. The camera pulls back to show the house is also covered in police tape] Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?"
98,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Crime scene investigation! [pulls out a small tape recorder and starts speaking into it] There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? [turns it off]
99,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this."
100,7,3,Officer Barbrady,[noticing the trash bags] Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
101,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Look it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid."
102,7,3,Officer Barbrady,You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
103,7,3,Mr Streibel,I was here.
104,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Aha!! Got you!
105,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Officer, why would I TP my own house?"
106,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Insurance?
107,7,3,Mr Streibel,"It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal."
108,7,3,Officer Barbrady,[grabs him by the collar] Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
109,7,3,Mr Streibel,"You really have nothing better to do, do you?"
110,7,3,Officer Barbrady,No I do not.
111,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]"
112,7,3,Mrs Streibel,AAAAAAAAA!
113,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Oh, Jesus no! Our house!"
114,7,3,The Streibel Girls,[crying] Mommy! Mommy!
115,7,3,Nancy Kerrigan (in nightmare),[being treated on the ice rink] Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?
116,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[wakes up, startled] Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth! [hops off the bed and runs to the bedroom door] Mooooomm! [opens the door and finds Cartman in the hallway]"
117,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[in rave tones] Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?"
118,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
119,7,3,Eric Cartman,No need. I have one for you right here. [presents a glass of water to him]
120,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,[takes the glass] Oh. Okay. Thanks.
121,7,3,Eric Cartman,Is there anything else I can get for you?
122,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now."
123,7,3,Eric Cartman,"You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. [closes the door]"
124,7,3,Prison Warden,Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year. [fumbles for his keys.] He's a real monster.
125,7,3,Officer Barbrady,I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think.
126,7,3,Prison Warden,Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance. [finally opens the door] He's the last cell on your left. [Barbrady enters and finds himself in an old part of the Hall. He walks past the prisoners and arrives at Josh's cell. It is a brick cell with a thick glass wall where prison bars would normally be. Holes in the glass allow for conversation. Josh has paintings of toilet paper around the cell.]
127,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police."
128,7,3,Josh,"[affecting a Hopkins accent] That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual."
129,7,3,Officer Barbrady,I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
130,7,3,Josh,And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?
131,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?"
132,7,3,Josh,[turns away] Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.
133,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh."
134,7,3,Josh,"[turns back] No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it? [a closeup of Josh's face] Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?"
135,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"[reflecting] Well, that's kind of personal."
136,7,3,Josh,"[extreme closeup] Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house."
137,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know."
138,7,3,Josh,"Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them. [approaches the drop slot as Barbrady slides the packet of photos in, then walks back and takes them out for review.] Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is."
139,7,3,Officer Barbrady,So you think there was more than one. Why?
140,7,3,Josh,"[puts the photos behind his back] Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?"
141,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! [cries uncontrollably]"
142,7,3,Josh,"[closes his eyes, satisfied.] Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man."
143,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second? [Stan waves bye to Clyde, Craig, and Kevin, and they leave. He and Kenny approach Cartman talks in hushed tones] I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle."
144,7,3,Stan Marsh,What about him?
145,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack."
146,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(I think so too.)
147,7,3,Eric Cartman,Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
148,7,3,Butters Stotch,[walks up] Ha-ey fellas. [Cartman and Kenny avoid eye contact with Butters]
149,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Butters. [looks down, then away, then sniffs, then clears his throat. After a while, Butters just walks off]"
150,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[a few seconds later] Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!"
151,7,3,Stan Marsh,So what should we do?
152,7,3,Eric Cartman,We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
153,7,3,Stan Marsh,"[just looks at Cartman] ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!"
154,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
155,7,3,Eric Cartman,Why not?
156,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?"
157,7,3,Eric Cartman,"He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. [walks off]"
158,7,3,Cashier,"You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?"
159,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene. [walks up to a body bag] I'm... sorry I have to do this. [unzips the bag and recoils with Bell at the apparent foul odor. They both cough]"
160,7,3,Mr Bell,Oh my God.
161,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Is this toilet paper from your store?
162,7,3,Mr Bell,"It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now."
163,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"[takes out the tape recorder, turns it on, and speaks into it] Positive ID on the toilet paper. [turns it off and puts it away]"
164,7,3,Mr Bell,Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who?
165,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?"
166,7,3,Mr Bell,Suspicious like how?
167,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern."
168,7,3,Mr Bell,"Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store. [arrives at a realization] Oh my God! [vomits]"
169,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What's this all about, Cartman?"
170,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?"
171,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,A boat ride?
172,7,3,Eric Cartman,I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
173,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, okay."
174,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat? [Kyle walks over and helps Cartman load the block and chain onto the boat. Kyle then hops in. Cartman retrieves a bat, loads it onto the boat, and hops in. The boat begins to float away from the shore.] Okay, let's go. [starts to row. The boat heads for the middle of the pond, and eerie music plays] So how are things, Kyle?"
175,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
176,7,3,Eric Cartman,And you feel like you have to confess.
177,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know what to do. [Cartman reaches for the bat while Kyle has his back to him] Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now. [Cartman takes aim] Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before. [Cartman moves the bat around, measuring Kyle] So cold. The world can feel like that. [Cartman moves forward, ready to whack him] So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens. [Cartman takes a whack at Kyle's head, but all Kyle does is blink] Ow. [rubs his head and turns around] What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!"
178,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. [whacks him again]"
179,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
180,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. [whacks him twice more]"
181,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You wanna kill me?! Fine! [turns around and crosses his arms] I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! [Cartman lowers the bat and thinks a bit, then resumes whacking Kyle. Once. Then eight more times.]"
182,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Won't be long, Kyle. [whacks him three more times.]"
183,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh, I need your help."
184,7,3,Josh,"The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it."
185,7,3,Officer Barbrady,How do you mean?
186,7,3,Josh,"Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?"
187,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Yes.
188,7,3,Josh,Single-sheet?
189,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"No, two-ply. [Josh closes his eyes and thinks hard] What? What does that tell you?"
190,7,3,Josh,Why does one toilet-paper houses
191,7,3,Officer Barbrady,To get revenge.
192,7,3,Josh,"No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation."
193,7,3,Officer Barbrady,What do you mean?
194,7,3,Josh,"Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?"
195,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"I don't have time for this, kid."
196,7,3,Josh,Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool house?
197,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! [cries uncontrollably]
198,7,3,Josh,"Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art."
199,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Oh. Of course! One of her students!
200,7,3,Josh,"Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make. [turns around and whispers to himself] Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy."
201,7,3,Prison Warden,"[arrives at Josh's cell] Josh, [the smile vanishes from Josh's face] were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?"
202,7,3,Josh,"[normal voice] No, sir."
203,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, what are you doing?"
204,7,3,Eric Cartman,I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
205,7,3,Stan Marsh,"You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!"
206,7,3,Eric Cartman,They did?
207,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,They did?
208,7,3,Stan Marsh,They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
209,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
210,7,3,Eric Cartman,But can I still kill Kyyyle?
211,7,3,South Park Police Department,Dialog
212,7,3,day The boys head for the station and enter,Dialog
213,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Hello boys. How are you?
214,7,3,Stan Marsh,We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
215,7,3,Officer Barbrady,It sure is!
216,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh, can we see them-him-her?"
217,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Right over here. [takes the boys over to the one jail cell] Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. [the boys turn right to see the suspect]"
218,7,3,Butters Stotch,Hey fellas!
219,7,3,Stan Marsh,Butters?
220,7,3,Butters Stotch,Yep. I'm in jail.
221,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,You con-fessed?
222,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house. [thoughtful] I don't seem to remember it, [normal] but they're pretty sure it was me. [approaches the bars and grabs them] I just can't get my behavior under control!"
223,7,3,Officer Barbrady,His parents are on their way down now.
224,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!"
225,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away, and the other boys huddle around him] You guys, we can't let him do this!"
226,7,3,Eric Cartman,What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
227,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!"
228,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house."
229,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Why do you say that?
230,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Because it was-
231,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up and intervenes] Wiffle ball, anyone? [glares at Kyle] Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?"
232,7,3,Butters Stotch,"You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too."
233,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by."
234,7,3,Eric Cartman,"You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?"
235,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I still feel bad, Cartman"
236,7,3,Eric Cartman,What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
237,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. That makes it even worse.
238,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever."
239,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,I know.
240,7,3,Eric Cartman,"So... so then, how can you feel bad?"
241,7,3,Stan Marsh,He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
242,7,3,Eric Cartman,...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
243,7,3,Stan Marsh,"It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad. [to Kyle] I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess."
244,7,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, maybe we should.)"
245,7,3,Eric Cartman,"What?? Eh... [tries to be upbeat] hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!"
246,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,We feel bad for other people.
247,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[looks at the other boys in disbelief] For oth-er... [winces] Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?"
248,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do. [points an accusing finger at Cartman] And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! [He, Kyle, and Kenny leave]"
249,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!"
250,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! [approaches the jail cell]
251,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Hi, Dad."
252,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Don't you ""Hi, Dad"" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!"
253,7,3,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
254,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!"
255,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Huh??
256,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady."
257,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!"
258,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol."
259,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,And that's your excuse?!
260,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. [goes to the cell door and opens it]"
261,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!"
262,7,3,Butters Stotch,"[steps back from the door] Officer, can I stay in jail, please?"
263,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you guys! Hurry! [steps forward and looks back to his friends] Guys, hurry!"
264,7,3,Stan Marsh,"[appears] What is it, Cartman? [Kyle and Kenny trail Stan]"
265,7,3,Eric Cartman,It's over this way! Come on!
266,7,3,Eric Cartman,"So how are things, guys?"
267,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final."
268,7,3,Eric Cartman,I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
269,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!"
270,7,3,Eric Cartman,Can't I? [pulls out the Wiffle ball bat and starts whacking the other three. They just look at each other.]
271,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Excuse me, everyone. [Mr. Mackey and Mrs. Streibel turn around. Principal Victoria sits at her desk] I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house! [the door opens and Josh is rolled in tied up to a dolly by a policeman. He quickly looks to his left] Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. [on top of a file cabinet near the door is a roll of toilet paper. Josh smiles]"
272,7,3,Mr Mackey,"Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-"
273,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[rushes in] Hold it! [Stan and Kenny rush in behind him] Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streibel. We have something we need to tell you."
274,7,3,Principal Victoria,"All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?"
275,7,3,Josh,"What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?"
276,7,3,Principal Victoria,[pointing] Get him out of here!
277,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?"
278,7,3,Josh,"[being rolled out] Ooh, Policeman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Policeman Brown? [the roll of toilet paper is now gone...]"
279,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,We have to confess that we were the ones that-
280,7,3,Mr Mackey,"It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything."
281,7,3,Stan Marsh,"You, you do? How?"
282,7,3,Eric Cartman,[steps forward from the back of the room] Hi guys.
283,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman??
284,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I told them everything, you guys. It's over."
285,7,3,Principal Victoria,"Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward."
286,7,3,Eric Cartman,My consciences just caught up with me.
287,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,That's not fair!
288,7,3,Mr Mackey,"You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave."
289,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!"
290,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. [turns and exits the room]"
291,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
292,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, Josh, time to go back to the... [sees Policeman Brown covered in toilet paper and Josh's dolly empty] Oh no!"
293,7,3,Policeman Brown,He... He was too fast for me. He ran out the door!
294,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Couldn't you have gone after him?
295,7,3,Policeman Brown,"Well, ah I'm covered in toilet paper. I'd look silly."
296,7,3,Mr Mackey,"Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?"
297,7,3,Stan Marsh,Wugh! Two weeks of this!
298,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now."
299,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later."
300,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh Jesus! [buries his face in his hands, then raises it as Cartman talks]"
301,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible."
302,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
303,7,3,Eric Cartman,Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
304,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!"
305,7,3,Eric Cartman,Hm.
306,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Police station.
307,7,3,Josh,[over the earpiece] Hello Officer Barbrady.
308,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh? Josh, where are you?!"
309,7,3,Josh,"I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell."
310,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence."
311,7,3,Josh,"Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao. [hangs up. Next to him are two boxes full of toilet paper. He picks them up and leaves the phone. The camera zooms out to reveal the location to be a park across the street from the White House. Josh heads for the White House, but stops at the curb to gaze at it.]"
