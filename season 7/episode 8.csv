0,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night."
1,7,8,Eric Cartman,What? Tell us?
2,7,8,Stan Marsh,"So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top."
3,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!"
4,7,8,Stan Marsh,I know!
5,7,8,Kenny McCormick,(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
6,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll."
7,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[joins them, but dressed as usual] Hey dudes. [the others glance at him]"
8,7,8,Eric Cartman,[begins to laugh at him] What a dork!
9,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
10,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! [laughs heartily]"
11,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear."
12,7,8,Stan Marsh,"You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend."
13,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. [Stan inspects Kyle's jacket]"
14,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??"
15,7,8,Eric Cartman,"We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys."
16,7,8,Kenny McCormick,(That's the truth.)
17,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! [the boys excitedly pull Kyle along to South Park Mall]"
18,7,8,Singers Widelife,"You... came into my life... and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
It's true. You bring out the best in me.
When you are around, when you are around, all things just keep getting better.
It keeps getting better. Life keeps getting better and better (All things just keep getting better)."
19,7,8,Announcer,"Coming up on HBC, it's Queer Eye for the Straight Guy!"
20,7,8,Carson,[a shot of Queer Eye...] We have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts!
21,7,8,Announcer,"[the night's schedule pops up over the scene] Then it's Boy Meets Boy, followed by Will and Grace, and then, the Love Boat... with Men."
22,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,"My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days."
23,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. [the door opens and the four newly-clothed boys enter]
24,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[waves] Hi Mom, Hi Dad!"
25,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,[looks and jumps to his feet] HAAAAAA!!! [walks over to Kyle] Kyle! What's happened to you??
26,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! [leads the others boys out of the living room]"
27,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh my God! Come on, Sheila! [she rises] We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! [they leave.]"
28,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh hi Gerald, Sheila."
29,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys."
30,7,8,Sharon Marsh,Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
31,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, is the game on or something? [they move towards the sofa, where a bunch of the men are watching]"
32,7,8,Randy Marsh,[moves over to Gerald and hugs him] Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! [the other men greet him as well]
33,7,8,Other Men,Geraaald! Hi Gerald.
34,7,8,Stuart McCormick,"Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on."
35,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? [the other men laugh]
36,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual."
37,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,What's that?
38,7,8,Skeeter,Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.
39,7,8,Stuart McCormick,"Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture."
40,7,8,Randy Marsh,It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
41,7,8,Sharon Marsh,Don't our men look
42,7,8,Linda Stotch,"Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best."
43,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,It is?
44,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures."
45,7,8,Linda Stotch,And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
46,7,8,Sarah Swanson,"My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. Oooh, I love it!"
47,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever."
48,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
49,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!"
50,7,8,Eric Cartman,"That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us."
51,7,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!!)
52,7,8,Stan Marsh,"All right. Let's work it! [shimmies a bit. The boys turn and pass through the entrance, but stop in their tracks.] What the...?"
53,7,8,Butters Stotch,"Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classes."
54,7,8,Connor,"Okay, sweetums. [they part ways. Butters goes off to his right. Farther away, near the drinking fountains, stand Timmy, Jimmy, Kevin, and Pip]"
55,7,8,Clyde Donovan,"Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! [turns right and follows after Butters. The boys look on in stunned silence]"
56,7,8,A Boy,"Hey dudes. [the boys look and it's Craig with Token, Jason, and Tweek]"
57,7,8,Stan Marsh,Hey Craig.
58,7,8,Craig Tucker,You guys look pretty gay.
59,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,[happily] Thanks.
60,7,8,Craig Tucker,"[him and his group are not happy about it] Not as gay as us, though."
61,7,8,Eric Cartman,"[moves in front of Kyle] Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!"
62,7,8,Craig Tucker,Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!
63,7,8,Eric Cartman,Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
64,7,8,Chef,"[arrives] What's all this fightin' about, children?!"
65,7,8,Stan Marsh,These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
66,7,8,Chef,"Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too."
67,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!"
68,7,8,Chef,"No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!"
69,7,8,Stan Marsh,We're metrosexual!!
70,7,8,Craig Tucker,"Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! [snaps his fingers and his group follows him away]"
71,7,8,Eric Cartman,"GOD I HATE CRAIG!! [Stan and Kenny turn to leave] That son of a... djah!! [leaves. Kyle turns to leave, but has second thoughts.]"
72,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual."
73,7,8,Chef,"Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool."
74,7,8,Mr Garrison,"All right children, let's take our seats."
75,7,8,Class,"[in unison] Good morning Mr. Garrison. [their dulcet tones get his attention, and he turns around]"
76,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, uh d-don't you all look nice."
77,7,8,Timmy Burch,"[responds, gestures gaily with his hands] Oooo, Timmy. [the door opens and Kyle enters. A closeup of the boys as Kyle goes to his seat]"
78,7,8,Stan Marsh,Dude! W-what are you doing?
79,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me."
80,7,8,Craig Tucker,HA! Told you you guys were straight!
81,7,8,Stan Marsh,We're not straight! You're straight!
82,7,8,Jason,You're straight!
83,7,8,Craig Tucker,You're straight!
84,7,8,Tweek Tweak,You're straight!
85,7,8,Token Black,You're straight!
86,7,8,Eric Cartman,You're straight like a freeway!
87,7,8,Mr Garrison,What the hell is going on??
88,7,8,Eric Cartman,"You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!"
89,7,8,Craig Tucker,"I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny stay silent, looking at each other]"
90,7,8,Eric Cartman,...So? I'm half bisexual!
91,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!"
92,7,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi."
93,7,8,Mr Garrison,WHAT??
94,7,8,Mr Garrison,"It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. [they cross the cross street and enter the bar at the corner]"
95,7,8,Mr Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ."
96,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Look at that, Mr. Slave. [a pan shot of the people there. He puts his hands over his mouth] Our cup runneth over."
97,7,8,Mr Slave,[puts his right hand over his mouth] Jesus Christ.
98,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"[standing with Ned at the bar] Mr. Garrison, those are great pants."
99,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too. [cuddles up to him] Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?"
100,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"Uh, for what?"
101,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, you know..."
102,7,8,Jimbo Kern,No.
103,7,8,Mr Garrison,Huh.
104,7,8,Randy Marsh,Mr. Garrison! [Garrison and Slave walk over] Hey doll.
105,7,8,Mr Garrison,Oh hey Randy.
106,7,8,Randy Marsh,You're looking ultra-fabulous.
107,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well thanks. You too. [leans in a bit] So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?"
108,7,8,Randy Marsh,"[turns his back to Mr. Garrison and walks away] Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that."
109,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Not, not like that?"
110,7,8,Richard Tweak,"[approaches, carries some glasses of wine] How about some shirazz, guys? [Garrison and Slave each take a glass]"
111,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Uh-Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek."
112,7,8,Richard Tweak,"My pleasure, silly-buns."
113,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, wuh, well uh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place."
114,7,8,Richard Tweak,Why?
115,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass."
116,7,8,Mr Slave,"Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ."
117,7,8,Richard Tweak,"Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight."
118,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!"
119,7,8,Patrons,Huh?
120,7,8,Mr Garrison,Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!
121,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, we don't ""pound butt,"" Mr. Garrison, we're straight."
122,7,8,Mr Garrison,Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
123,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt."
124,7,8,Mr Garrison,"No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!"
125,7,8,Skeeter,"So, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now."
126,7,8,Patrons,Yeah.
127,7,8,Mr Garrison,One of you?! [throws his glass down] We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
128,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp."
129,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Wow, is that from Origins?"
130,7,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
131,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,[approaches with a football] Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
132,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second? [pulls Stan and Kenny away from Kyle] Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle."
133,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, what can we do about it?"
134,7,8,Eric Cartman,"We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle."
135,7,8,Stan Marsh,What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
136,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore."
137,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Wait, what?"
138,7,8,Eric Cartman,"You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy."
139,7,8,Craig Tucker,"[approaches with his friends] Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. [they laugh at him]"
140,7,8,Token Black,"When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? [Kyle picks up his football]"
141,7,8,Jason,"Yeah, let's see that hair. [lifts up Kyle's hat] Look, he's not even using any product! [he and the others laugh at him. Other boys gather in and join in the laughter]"
142,7,8,Stan Marsh,"[returns with Cartman and Kenny] Hey, what's goin' on?"
143,7,8,Craig Tucker,"Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!"
144,7,8,Eric Cartman,He's not our friend. [Stan's jaw drops a bit. Cartman looks at Stan and walks away. Kenny follows]
145,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan? [Stan looks at Kyle, sighs, and walks away]"
146,7,8,Jason,"[shoves Kyle a bit] This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!"
147,7,8,Craig Tucker,Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! [the other boys gather round Kyle and gang up on him]
148,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,No! Ah!
149,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,[sees him and drops her duster to kneel next to him] Kyle! What happened to you?!
150,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,[sniffs] I got beat up at school... for being different.
151,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
152,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,No! For not being a metrosexual.
153,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald! Gerald, get down here!"
154,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[upstairs. Disco music plays] Here I come! [dances down the stairs, then moonwalks right back up, then strikes a pose.]"
155,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
156,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,Kyle! You look terrible! [walks down and approaches him]
157,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,"The boys at school beat him up, Gerald."
158,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look."
159,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Gah! Just leave me alone! [walks away and passes the TV]
160,7,8,A voice,There you go! Now you look fabulous.
161,7,8,Kyan,You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.
162,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,GRRRRR!!
163,7,8,"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy

 Kyan
 Carson
 Jai
 Thom",Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps. [the straight man smiles]
164,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,That does it! I know what I have to do! [walks off]
165,7,8,Chef,"Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison."
166,7,8,Mr Garrison,"[sadly] Chef, can I talk to you?"
167,7,8,Chef,Sure. Come on in.
168,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Thanks. Come, Slave. [yanks Mr. Slave in by a leash around his neck. Both men sit on Chef's couch. Mr. Slave buries his face in his hands] Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!"
169,7,8,Mr Slave,[sobs] Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!
170,7,8,Chef,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?"
171,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?"
172,7,8,Chef,"Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them."
173,7,8,Mr Slave,[straightens up] How did you do that?
174,7,8,Chef,"Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, ""I'm in the house"" instead of ""I'm here."" But then white people all started to say ""in the house"" so we switched it to ""in the hizzouse."" Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then ""in the hizzle"" which we had to change to ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" and now, because white people say ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" we have to say ""flippity floppity floop."""
175,7,8,Mr Garrison,"[slumps forward] We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing. [thinks] Wait. [rises] That's it! I know exactly what to do! [yanks on Mr. Slave's leash] Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. [exits the front door with Mr. Slave]"
176,7,8,Chef,Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! [the door closes]
177,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"One ticket to New York, please."
178,7,8,South Park Train Station Clerk,[handing a ticket over] You're going to New York alone?
179,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
180,7,8,South Park Train Station Clerk,"Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes."
181,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Mrrh.
182,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Garrison?
183,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Kyle, what are you doing here?"
184,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
185,7,8,Mr Garrison,What?? That's what I'm doing!
186,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
187,7,8,Mr Garrison,They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
188,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,I thought of it first!
189,7,8,Mr Garrison,No you didn't! No you didn't!
190,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Did so! Did so!
191,7,8,Mr Garrison,I thought of it yesterday!
192,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,I thought of it two days ago!
193,7,8,Mr Garrison,I thought of it before you were born!
194,7,8,Mr Slave,"Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?"
195,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh. [sigh] You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together."
196,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cool.
197,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Wow, we look great!"
198,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now."
199,7,8,Randy Marsh,Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men! [leaves. The boys follow him out. Randy calls out to the other men in the mall] Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! [their wives sit on benches in the center of the mall with nothing to do]
200,7,8,Richard Tweak,Oh my God!
201,7,8,Man,Let's go! Let's go!
202,7,8,Ryan Swanson,[walking down the far side of the mall] You guys have got to see these shoes I bought!
203,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!"
204,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!"
205,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great."
206,7,8,Linda Stotch,I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
207,7,8,Mrs Tweek,I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.
208,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show! [the guys cheer]"
209,7,8,Carson,What can I say? We're fabulous.
210,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"You guys are changing the world! And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States!"
211,7,8,Jai,"Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint. [a knock is heard at the door, then it opens]"
212,7,8,Mr Garrison,Room service. [a service cart rolls in]
213,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,What? We didn't order any room service.
214,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up."
215,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Carol? [lifts the platter's lid for a brief peek, then lowers it] Well, I'll have to check on this. Excuse me a minute, fellas. [leaves. Mr. Garrison continues inside the office when the coast is clear. He takes the cart to the desk and parks it there. Kyle pops out and rushes to lock the door]"
216,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Clear!
217,7,8,Mr Garrison,"[whips out his walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Okay, Mr. Slave! [From a nearby building Mr. Slave swings down like Spiderman and crashes through the window, but passes out on impact. His body collapses on the floor]"
218,7,8,Mr Slave,"Unh, Jesus [a chunk of window falls onto his ass] Christ."
219,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well crap, that didn't work."
220,7,8,Stan Marsh,"You'd better shut up, Craig."
221,7,8,Craig Tucker,Everyone knows it's true!
222,7,8,Stan Marsh,It is not!
223,7,8,Craig Tucker,Is so!
224,7,8,Tom,Craig! Behave yourself!
225,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?"
226,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!"
227,7,8,Randy Marsh,"What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about."
228,7,8,Tom,Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.
229,7,8,Randy Marsh,Oh really?!
230,7,8,Tom,"I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman."
231,7,8,Men,Ooooo.
232,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare."
233,7,8,Other men,"Oh no, errrr!"
234,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?! [the men fall silent] Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!"
235,7,8,Tom,You don't... like us being metrosexual?
236,7,8,The Women,NO!
237,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!"
238,7,8,The Males,Yeah!!
239,7,8,Linda Stotch,What?
240,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!"
241,7,8,Sharon Marsh,This is crazy!
242,7,8,Randy Marsh,"[steps forward, past the boys] Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!"
243,7,8,Tom,"[steps forward, past the boys] You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!"
244,7,8,Craig Tucker,"[steps forward, past his father] Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are."
245,7,8,Eric Cartman,"[steps forward] That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade."
246,7,8,Ryan Swanson,"Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!"
247,7,8,Stuart McCormick,We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
248,7,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoohoo!)
249,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!"
250,7,8,The Males,Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets!
251,7,8,Mrs Tweek,What the hell did that show do to them?
252,7,8,Officer Barbrady,You sure you don't want to press charges?
253,7,8,Kyan,"That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong."
254,7,8,Carson,Especially in those pants.
255,7,8,Mr Garrison,"[the cops leave] Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!"
256,7,8,Jai,Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!
257,7,8,Mr Garrison,"But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left."
258,7,8,Kyan,"Sorry Charlie, no sale. [he and the others turn and walk away]"
259,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Buh... but... this doesn't make sense! [grabs his head] How can gay men do this to their own people?? [the Queer Eye guys reach the exit] Unless... you're not gay at all... [the guys stop, turn around, look at Garrison angrily, then return]"

 Kyan
 Carson
 Jai
 Thom","You just had to push it, didn't you?!"
261,7,8,Jai,Just had to keep asking question!
262,7,8,Carson,[locks the exit] Now you know the truth!
263,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,They aren't gay? Then what are they?
264,7,8,Kyan,For a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished by man in the Kindling Wars.
265,7,8,Mr Garrison,Oh my God. [Kyan steps forward and begins to crumble. A walking crab pops out]
266,7,8,Leader,We are the Crab People!
267,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
268,7,8,Mr Slave,Jesus Christ!
269,7,8,The Queer Eye Guys,[they too crumble and advance] Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!
270,7,8,Crab People,Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!.
271,7,8,Crab Leader,"[entirely red] See now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years! But soon we shall rule the land above, and mankind will be gone!"
272,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Gone?? [""Crab People! Crab People!""]"
273,7,8,Crab Man 2,"Crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force, and so we came up with our perfect plan! [another crab person walks over to a closet full of human shells, all of them replicas of the Queer Eye guys. The crab person climbs in a Carson replica and closes the shell behind him. Carson's replica comes to life]"
274,7,8,Carson replica,"If you can't beat man, [drops down from his hook] change man!"
275,7,8,Mr Garrison,I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! [some crab people restrain him and Mr. Slave]
276,7,8,Crab Leader,"When all the world is metrosexual, the crab people shall finally reign supreme!! [raises his pincers and claps. The other crab people join him and clap]"
277,7,8,Crab People,Crab People! Crab People!
278,7,8,Crab Solo,"Taste like crab, talk like people."
279,7,8,Crab People,Crab People!
280,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!"
281,7,8,Crab Man 2,"[approaches] Very well. If we can't make you into metrosexuals, then we will make you into crab people! Take them!! [the crab people swarm in and separate the hostages. Some of them take Kyle into Crabwear and select a crab outfit for him to wear. Then they take him to Crab Salon and put antennae on his hat, then they take him to get a facial, then they march him down the underground road]"
282,7,8,Singers Crab People,"All things just keep getting better
You... came into my life
(Crab People)
and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
(Crab People)
It's true. You bring out the best in me.

All things just keep getting better.

283,7,8,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade is underway! [in a rainbow peacock float Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter and Stuart ride and cheer. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny ride in a banana float which features an ocean wave and a palm tree. On the tree waves a rainbow flag that says ""Here to Stay"""
284,7,8,The Boys,"We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!
We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!"
285,7,8,Sharon Marsh,[as the boys' voices fade away] That does it! I can't take it anymore!
286,7,8,The Boys,"We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!"
287,7,8,Linda Stotch,"I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband."
288,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! [leads the ladies away. Randy's float hits a pothole and veers to the right. It hits the sushi restaurant as the spectators back away quickly]"
289,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"Whoa, look out! [the float hits the building and breaks a window. A small fire is heard]"
290,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, it's on fire! [the men jump out of the float and run to the other side of the street]"
291,7,8,Skeeter,Put it out! Put it out!
292,7,8,Randy Marsh,I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
293,7,8,Skeeter,The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!
294,7,8,Officer Barbrady,"[seated on his patrol car, buffing his nails] Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!"
295,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"[the float and building are now fully engulfed in flames] Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!"
296,7,8,Skeeter,Eeeek!
297,7,8,Randy Marsh,Put it out! Put it out! Fire!
298,7,8,Carson,"Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over!"
299,7,8,Kyan,"Now, we've got to do something with your hair."
300,7,8,"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy
 Ted
 Kyan
 Carson
 Jai
 Thom",And your nails are filthy. Let's get those clean.
301,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"This is gay gold! [Mr. Garrison, Mr. Slave, and Kyle look down from the sound booth]"
302,7,8,Mr Garrison,Stop them! They're crab people!
303,7,8,Crab Man 3,"They cannot see or hear us, foolish man. Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helpless!!"
304,7,8,Carson,"That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket. [Kyan, Jai, and Thom remove the President's coat and Carson hands him the jacket]"
305,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,No Mr. President!! Don't do it! [the crab man holding him quickly covers his mouth] Help!
306,7,8,Mr Garrison,You bastards!
307,7,8,Kyan,"That looks great! Now, how about some moisturizer. [Bush and the guys smile. The studio door bursts open and the women flood into the studio wielding bats]"
308,7,8,Sharon Marsh,There they are! Get 'em!
309,7,8,Kyan,What? [their smiles vanish]
310,7,8,Linda Stotch,You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
311,7,8,Sarah Swanson,It's payback time! [the women rush in and start beating up the Queer Eye guys]
312,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Oh my God, what are they doing?!"
313,7,8,Crab Man 3,Oh noooo!! [Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave react and crack the crab people in two in the booth as the women finish Queer Eye guys off below]
314,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,[kneeling at the corpses of Carson and Kyan] Wha? What have you done?
315,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't."
316,7,8,Linda Stotch,"That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to."
317,7,8,Sarah Swanson,"We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys."
318,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Well you're going to jail for thi-! [Kyan's body begins to move, and the HoP looks down] Wait a minute. [a crab man crawls out] What is that?"
319,7,8,Crab Leader,No! Our evil plans! Noooo... [dies]
320,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,Oh my God. They were crab people.
321,7,8,Mr Garrison,[enters the studio with Slave and Kyle in tow] Yes! They were trying to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
322,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Mom!
323,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle!
324,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,I should have known they were crab people. They tried this before with The Jefferson.
325,7,8,Mr Garrison,"So now, can you please change your network's programming?"
326,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad."
327,7,8,Randy Marsh,Hey eses.
328,7,8,Stuart McCormick,Hey hefe. You want some cerveza? [hands Randy a beer.]
329,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?"
330,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
331,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. It's cool, holmes."
332,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?"
333,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. [turns and walks away]"
334,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! [turns and walks away. Kenny just looks at him and walks off. Kyle looks away, then back at the boys, then walks away in the opposite direction. He stops, thinks for a while, then turns around and hurries to them]"
335,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,God-damnit!
