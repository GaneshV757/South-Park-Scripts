We are live at South Park Elementary School where the local girl's volleyball team is about to take on the Jefferson Sabers.; And, hey Jim, it is packed. Sellout crowds tonight, first time in team history. Everyone turning out to see what's going to happen.; [Camera switches to Nichole, who is stretching] That's right, Mike. All eyes are of course on fourth grader Nichole Daniels. Will she sit or stand for the National Anthem? [The crowd stare at her.]; This week with athletes all over the country sitting down for the National Anthem, [Two people are seen holding a banner reading 'WE SUPPORT YOU NICHOLE!'] the question on everyone's mind is ""What is this little girl gonna do?""; She's not gonna sit down. Why would she?; Screw that. I've got 100 bucks riding on this. Come on, Nichole. Sit on it!; Now please rise for the National Anthem. [they stand up.]; This is it.; The National Anthem starts. Nichole Daniels seems to be waiting. So far no si... Oh! [The camera moves to Heidi Turner, who is sitting down.] And Heidi Turner is sitting down!; Ooh!; Might be totally unexpected. All eyes were on Nichole when Heidi Turner comes out of nowhere and sits down.; [Interrupting] And there goes Meghan Ridley! The crowd is going wild. What a turn of events! Let's check in with Dave.; And Mike, I've just looked at the girl's Twitter accounts and it appears they are sitting out the National Anthem to protest the harassment and trolling they receive on the Internet.; Complete surprise, Dave. Nobody saw this coming. Three girls now sitting down and finally, there goes Nichole.; Wow, Yeah, 100 bucks!; And, as the anthem draws to a close, this thing is over.; The final result, four athletes sitting out of the National Anthem, three of them not even black. A shocker here in South Park, thanks for joining us. [People start leaving]; Oh my god, that was great. [The crowds empty out, leaving only a few left.]; Ah, play ball. [Blows whistle. The girls start playing.]; Alright, ladies. First of all I wanna say that I completely respect your decision to protest our national anthem. Thought it was sweet. I believe you shed some light on some very important issues regarding gender equality.; What are you doing about Eric Cartman?!; Ladies, I understand you're upset about the trolling you've received on the Internet, but there is no evidence that Eric Cartman is Skankhunt42.; It is him, it's completely obvious, and nobody is doing anything about it!; Well he claims that he's been working at changing himself and the world around him. [presses the intercom button] Send in Mr. Cartman.; [opens the door and enters] You wanted to see me, PC Principal?; Mr. Cartman, I'm gonna ask you one more time, are you or are you not the Internet troll Skankhunt42?; It's ""Skankhunt42"" and no I am not.; He's lying. Make him show you his phone.; Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did.; Fellow Senators, our nation is divided like never before. While people everywhere fight for their voices to be heard, perhaps it is time for us to consider that our national anthem needs to be changed. Americans need an anthem that inspires and excites, an anthem that has something for everyone while still paying tribute to what it once was. I believe there's only one person capable of achieving this. [clicks on a handheld button and the picture behind him changes] J.J. Abrams.; [murmuring among themselves] J.J. Abrams!; He saved Star Wars, and now we will ask him to save our country.; [over a megaphone] Mr. Abrams? Mr. Abrams, we need to speak with you.; Look, there. [a light comes on at the left end of the second floor, and a shadow stops by the window]; [over the megaphone] Mr. Abrams I speak on behalf of Americans everywhere. We've come to ask you to reboot the national anthem. Please Mr. Abrams. We know you've been asked to reboot a lot.; [whispering] We know you're tired.; We know you're tired.; [takes the megaphone] What do you say, sir? We all want something new and that makes us remember the things we lost. We want to 'member! We need your 'member berries! [Abrams mulls it over]; One light means yes, two lights means no. [Abrams reaches to his left and one light comes on. The gathered crowd goes wild.]; Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of Skankhunt42 has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students believe that it's just because girls don't have a sense of humor. I beg to disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wendy Testaburger, guys. [some of the kids clap, Wendy stands up and walks over to Cartman] Wendy, go ahead. Be funny. [he holds the mic to her face, and she looks at him warily. He tried harder, she leans farther away] Say something funny, Wendy. We can't wait.; I'm not funny.; Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say ""my vagina"" a lot..; I don't feel like being funny right now.; And that's just the kind of sexist bull-crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen. Sit your ass down. [Wendy goes back to her spot on the gym floor] This isn't a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. Bebe, why don't you come up here? Come on, Bebe.; NO!; No? Come on, talk about havin' sex with guys, and say ""vagina"" and stuff like that. Go ahead. [looks her over quickly] Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. Seriously.; Get the mic out of my face!; [moves away] Huh. Oh my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird. Um, let's see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly?; Yeah, I got one. You're a fat fuck! [Butters got a great laugh out of that one]; K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry.; [stands up] You see, what the problem is, is that when a little troll is allowed to say anything he wants anonymously, then he speaks for all you boys!; K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now.; Go ahead and get on our school message board and see what he's saying about us! Then see if you guys think it's funny!; Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, ""my vagina.""; And as our country seems to be more and more divided, the only hope is that J.J. Abrams' new national anthem will appeal to everyone and bring back those nostalgic member berries we know and love.; Oh great. Everything's getting a reboot now. [There's a knock on the door and he answers it.]; Hello sir. I'm with the Gallup poll. We're trying to get a read on how people will be voting in the upcoming Presidential election?; Oh. Oh-okay.; Great. And will you be voting for the giant douche or the turd sandwich?; Well, this is usually a giant douche household but... we're going firmly with the turd sandwich.; Oh, the turd sandwich, huh?; That's right. [Sharon appears behind him and sees him talking to the Pollster] You can put my wife and I both down for turd sandwich.; Well, good luck with that, heh. So far, giant douche is leading in the polls.; [shocked] What?; What the hell is wrong with people?! They really think that a giant douche should be President?? It's insane!; Why'd you say I'd be voting for the turd sandwich, Randy? You haven't even talked to me about it.; You can't possibly be thinking about voting for the douche?!; Hhhawgh!; What's wrong with you?; I just don't understand why every four years you people freak out over whether to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich.; [snidely] Because we're Americans. 'Cause this is America; Why are we doing this again? Why are we back to giant douche and turd sandwich?; [holds his palms out like fans] Cyyynical. Cynical maaan. You just think everything and everyone is dumb, huh? 'Cause you're a nihilist.; It's nihilist.; See, you're such a nihilist.; Newest Gallup Poll results are in and they show Giant Douche to be leading Turd Sandwich by nearly 10%. Turd Sandwich has said there's no reason to panic.; Polls are of course a useful tool, but they can often be misleading. Our campaign is holding strong.; [after some clamor from the press corps] Mrs. Turd Sandwich?; Yes, Arthur?; Uh, Mrs. Sandwich, do you believe that your opponent will gain any momentum from this poll?; I'm sure that like me, Giant Douche realizes that polls are never the final answer.; Yeah! Suck that poll you dumb bitch! Up 10%. Can you believe that shit?! [walks over to the table on which the radio sits] Oh, Caitlyn. I think we're really gonna win this thing! Think about it. [softly, awed] In a couple of months I will be President of the United States. [begins to worry and turns off the radio] Caitlyn, can I ask you somethin'? Uh, when we actually get into the White House, like um, what are we gonna do?; What do you mean?; Well I mean, like, you know, once we're President and Vice-President, like, what do we do then?; How the fuck should I know?; [getting exasperated] Cait, you, you heard about the poll, right? We're probably gonna win. Don't tell me you don't have a plan.; What plan? I thought you had a plan.; I don't have any fuckin' plan! That's why I have you! I'm gonna be the President and you're gonna be in charge of all foreign and domestic policies!; I thought you were gonna do that part.; Are you tellin' me that we're about to be voted into office and we have no idea what the fuck we're gonna do?? [makes two fists] Ohhh Jeeez!; I think they called it German Collective Guilt, right? Where even the Germans who just did nothing while Hitler rose to power were, were maybe somehow also responsible?; Uh huh, uh, m'kay, okay.; But I can't control what Cartman does, so, so why should I feel ashamed for what Cartman does?; Well J.J. Abrams was just rebooting the National Anthem, Kyle, so everything's gonna be fine, m'kay?; I don't think the answer to all this is member berries.; You don't like mem- member berries?; Agh, never mind. I'm just gonna stay out of it. [gets up and leaves the office. A few seconds later, Mr. Mackey opens a drawer in his desk and pulls out a mason jar with member berries in it. He opens the jar and lifts the berries out]; Oh I 'member. 'Member Chewbacca? Yeah. And 'member AT-ATs? Member? Ey! Hey, 'member Ghostbusters? Ohh, I 'member. 'Member Slimer? Oh, I loved Slimer. 'Member? Ohh, I 'member. [they keep 'membering]; How could someone think these things are bad? [plucks a berry and eats it]; The Commander in Chief Forum, with a giant douche and a turd sandwich.; Back now with the Commander in Chief Forum. I am joined by the Republican nominee, a giant douche.; Thanks, Matt.; Mr. Douche, some say you don't actually have a viable plan in place if you were to be elected President.; Huh! Huh well, well who said that? The turd sandwich?; In your campaign, you said that you will deal with our country's immigrants and enemies by personally [reading his notes] fucking them all to death. How do you plan to actually achieve that?; Well, Matt, I don't think I said I would fuck them all to death.; Okay, well, let's roll the tape on that.; Oh, sure, okay. [they sit back as clips from previous statements are aired. First, from the time the fleeing Canadian kids were enrolled at South Park Elementary] Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's ""fuck them all to death!"" [At Niagara Falls] Fuck them all to death! Let's make this country great again!; Fuck them all to death!; [St. Louis] And then I'm gonna take all the drug pushers in our country, and I'm gonna fuck them-! [another rally] And you know those people in Syria, I'm gonna fuck them! [in Washington, D.C., all worked up] That's how we'll make sure that every terrorist on earth is fuckin' dead! [in a desert] The leaders of North Korea? I'll fuck them all, yeah! [Club Emotion] Yeah! Yeah! [another rally] The criminals in our jails?! Fuckin' dead a day after I- [another rally] Yeah! Those ads that are tryin' to kill us? I'll fuck anyone in the advertising business! And they'll all die too!; So by our estimates, it's roughly 7.6 million people you have promised to fuck to death in your first year of office.; Uh huh, okay.; And, and, you think that's achievable?; I do. I do, Matt. Uh, I mean, I'm not gonna just get elected, you know, and, and look like a jackass. Huh, huhuh. [fearfully] Ohhh Jeeez.; Alright kids, today we have a very special treat. One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you. Come on over, Eric.; [enters] Hi guys! [takes a seat] Are you all ready to hear a story?; Yeah!; This was a book I created all with my imagination. It's called ""Little Red Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was a little black boy named Token."" Get over it. ""But then, a big bad wolf who was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said 'I have a large vagina' and traded place-"" [Kyle enters and pull him out of the room.]; What the hell are you doing?!; Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls.; You really think you're fooling anyone with this fake persona?! Everyone knows you're acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the Internet at night!; Why would I do that, Kyle?; I don't really care! Just don't drag me into it! [takes Cartman's book and slams it down on the floor, then walks away angrily]; What is wrong with people, huh?! How can they vote against a turd sandwich more than a giant douche?! It's senseless!; Randy, you gotta calm down.; [grabs onto Stephen] How can anyone be calm at a time like this?! [lets go] People actually think a turd is worse than a douche!; Look, maybe you need some supplements to help calm your nerves. Have you heard of member berries?; Member berries?; It's a new superfruit that helps you mellow out and relax.; 'Member The Fugitive? 'Member Akira? 'Member Alien Nation? Yeah, I 'member...; The guys at work told me about them. Been taking them about six months now. I'll telling you, they really take the edge off.; 'Member Explorers? The little kids in a spaceship? 'Member storm troopers? 'Member?; Oh, they're adorable. [plucks one and eats it]; Come on, people! I need answers! Real solutions! You're my advisers, for Christ's sake! How do we do this?!; Maybe, if you swam in a pool in Florida, you could contract the Zika virus. Then you fuck all the people you can, and hope they eventually die.; That would take way too long! And there's no guarantee every pool in Florida has Zika!; Could you use nuclear weapons? Then fuck all the bodies after the fact?; [walks to the table and takes a seat] Ugh! What the hell do I do? If I win I won't be able to do what I promised. But every day I keep going up in the polls. Why did the Democrats have to elect such a turd sandwich?; Maybe you should just quit.; If I quit, I look like a total jackass. [gets up and walks away, stopping by the ""Pin The Tail On The Donkey"" picture with Hillary's face on it.] If I win the election, I look like a total jackass. I have to keep running, [turns to face the picture] but I have to make sure she wins.; Haha! You guys see what Skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he photo shopped a picture of Heidi Turner's mom with a dick in her mouth!; I wanna see.; [shows the other boys] Look! There's Wendy's mom with a dick in her mouth too! [Jimmy laughs and takes a closer look]; Goddammit! [takes the phone from Butters] Do you guys even care how this makes the girls feel?!; We didn't do it.; We all know who did! And if we don't do something, then the girls will eventually retaliate against us!; [from a distance] Help! [the other boys see him as he runs to them] Help me! Augh! Aw! [reaches the other boys]; Eric! What happened!; A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this vagina on my face! [well, it's there, but with a pair of testicles attached to it] They said it was to send a message!; That's a vagina?; Yeah. See, here's the top of the vagina and there's the balls. [Kyle has lost interest] It's starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore!; [flatly] I didn't know vagina had balls.; Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?; You're just trying to start a war, aren't you?!; What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?; It's not gonna work, Cartman! I'm not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore! when this whole thing comes to an end, you're gonna be all on your own! [walks away]; Hello sir, how are you today? I'm calling from the Campaign for President, just seeing if uh, I can get your support for Hillary Clinton today. Yes, I know she's a turd sandwich, but you know if ya, if you look past that, you know she, she really has a lot to offer. Well, I hear you, but sometimes in life you just gotta suck a turd, you know? Hello? [hangs the phone up up with anger] Dammit! This is impossible! Are you having' any success, Caitlyn?!; I've tried to get people on board, but she's just such a turd sandwich. You're just gonna have to do something awful to throw the election.; Every time I do something awful people just get more stoked on me! It's impossible to piss people off anymore!; This is breaking news. The moment has arrived. It is here. J.J. Abrams says he has finished the new National Anthem.; Turn it up.; The anthem is sure to be fresh and exciting while recapturing the moments we all knew and loved. Democratic nominee Turd Sandwich said she will be in attendance to show her support for the rebooted anthem.; Ohhh Jeeez.; Let's all hope that this new anthem puts our differences aside and unites this nation once again.; That's it, Cait. That's what I have to do. I'm gonna sit out the National Anthem on live television. Then everyone will have to vote for that turd sandwich!; 'Member Spock? Yeah. 'Member tricorders? I 'member. And 'member Bionic Man?; Ohh, I 'member.; Oh I loved Bionic Man [Randy plucks him and eats him.]; 'Member the Millennium Falcon? 'member Chewbacca again? Oh I love to 'member Chewbacca. I 'member. 'Member? Hey hey hey! 'Member when there weren't so many Mexicans? Oh, I 'member.; Wai- what?; Yeah, yeah, yeah! 'Member when marriage was just between a man and a woman? I 'member! Oh, I 'member. Oh yeahhh.; [fondly] Yeeah, I remember that. [catches himself] Wait.; 'Member feeling safe? 'Member no ISIS? 'Member Reagan? Ohh, I 'member. Ooo, 'member? Ooo, 'member? [Randy sits up and spits out what's left of the berries he's eaten]; What the fuck's going on with these member berries?; Yeah?; [opens the door and comes in] Hey broship. Got a minute?; What are you doing here??; You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls.; I'm going to the bathroom!; Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem.; [finishes up and hops off the toilet, pulling his pants up] They sat it out because you were harassing them online.; Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?; Why would you care?!; 'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too??; If we could just prove who the troll was, then the girls wouldn't be wanting a war, would they?!; Yeah but... you can't track down an Internet troll, [peers down into the toilet] it's too bad.; Just know this, Cartman! I'm going to prove who Skankhunt 42 is, whatever it takes! Everyone is going to know! And Skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's! ever! said!; Hello everyone, we are live at tonight's game between the '49ers and the Panthers, but of course what everyone is really here for, the unveiling of the new National Anthem rebooted by J.J. Abrams.; And Mike, this new anthem is said to have everything the old one had but, some new surprises as well. You'd have to be an absolute asshole not to stand and support it.; This is such a big night for America that both Presidential candidates are here. [Hillary stands up and waves to the camera] There you can see the Turd Sandwich waving to all four people excited by her. [A shot of Garrison and Jenner in their own box, with Garrison waving happily to the crowd] And there's the Giant Douche doing the same.; When I sit down to not support this thing I'm sure to lose this election!; Ladies and Gentlemen-; Here it is!; And the Anthem begins, let's hope this fixes America.; For our National Anthem we now ask you all in solidarity to please rise. [Garrison sits down] Or sit, or take a knee, in order to honor America. [Kaepernick, who has taken a knee, is as confused as anyone else]; Wait a min- what, wait, what? Wait. [tries to strike a pose that isn't standing, sitting, or kneeling, but gets nothing.]; Ohhh! And J.J. Abrams has absolutely shattered expectations, Mike! Now whether people are standing, sitting, or kneeling, they are all honoring America. J.J. Abrams is a wizard, Tom. A wizard. [Colin Kaepernick is also trying to figure out what to do]; More people sitting now as Abrams has made it irrelevant. Who saw this coming?; And there's the rest of the Anthem, all the parts we remembered and loved. J.J. Abrams has fixed America.; No, this was supposed to! Oh! OHHH JEEEZ!; [opens the bedroom door] Hey Kyle. [Kyle looks at him] You okay, son?; Yeah Dad. Just thinkin'.; Well um, I'll be in my office if you wanna talk. [leaves and closes the door. He walks to his office at the end of the hallway]"

Nobody can hide from these monsters. Internet trolls are truly predators of society. As parents we find it hard to believe our children are doing these things online, and that is why I've been asked to come and speak to you about the student who has been trolling your school message boards.; This troll is known only as Skankhunt42. [He cycles to the next slide.]; We believe it probable he's one of the boy students here, since his favorite target seems to be women. Here, you can see Heidi Turner's mother photo shopped with a penis in her mouth, after she defended her daughter's right to sit out the national anthem.; Since then, this child has been trolling all over the internet. Visiting message boards, and social media, and filling it with vile comments and hate-filled garbage. [The camera pans to Gerald smiling as Dr. Schroeder talks.]; But trolling is on the rise with teenagers, and we all need to come together to stop it. We need every parent to look for the signs in their own child.; In order for us to find these secretive monsters, we need all parents to ask themselves: ""Could my child be a troll?"".; My God, what children are capable of now. What kind of hate would have to be in that child's heart?; Well, you never know, could be someone who just, kind of thinks it's funny to stir the pot and watch everyone freak out. [Sheila gives Gerald a questioning look]; Uh, you know! Maybe the fact that it's so not funny makes it somehow funny, to kids? Gosh, I-I certainly don't understand it.; Dude, what's going on?; You didn't hear?; Hear what? What happened?; Heidi Turner. She... she quit Twitter.; Oh no. [Heidi walks past them, looking down.]; Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good.; She'll get back on.; No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone.; Alright students, I know we're all dealing with the loss of a good friend. We have to accept the fact that Heidi won't be on social media anymore. I know we're all gonna miss her, m'kay. We're gonna miss, seeing what she's up to; miss seeing her silly pictures she'd post of her and her friends, m'kay.; But this is what can happen when someone gets bullied online to the point they just can't go on anymore. [Kyle angrily looks over at Cartman.]; I know that some of you are feeling anger, m'kay. [Annie, Wendy, and Nichole are angrily looking down] Some of you are feeling a little guilt, asking how something like this can happen. But the best thing we can do for Heidi, is come together as friends, and as students, m'kay.; So now, why don't we all get on Twitter, m'kay, and just tweet some of the, things we loved about Heidi, m'kay?; M'kay. Oh, that's nice, that's nice, m'kay. Oh, that's a good one Sarah, uh-huh. That-that's a - that's a pretty poem. Nice Butters. Oh, Heidi would have loved this so much. This is so special, m'kay.; Okay. Can we all agree now, [Stan glares at Cartman] that whoever is doing this, needs to stop?; Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough. [Kyle looks unimpressed.] The girls are really pissed off at us. [He drinks from a milk carton.]; So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it!; You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight! [Kyle still looks unimpressed.] I am so, seriously.; Ike? Can I talk to you? [Takes a seat on Ike's bed] Come on, pull up a chair.; You know, we had a big parent meeting at the school tonight, and uh, apparently, there's someone trolling the school message boards and, putting... penises in people's mouths. And whoever it was then got a big reaction from it, so he's now putting penises in people's mouths all over the internet. And... he's actually getting pretty famous!; Sooo, Annie Jerkin's mother started an online campaign to stop internet trolling with a picture of her and her daughter, and you know what happened? She got a dick in her mouth!; Ha-okay, okay, I know, it's just guy humor stuff, you know. We can laugh about about it here, but, it is serious too. Well, love you pal. Get to sleep, it's a school night.; Oh, hey!; Did you talk to him?; Yeah, yeah, we talked. It was good.; Oh, that's good.; Yeah, well, I'd better go and get some of my work done.; Oh, right, right, yeah.; Yeah, don't wait up. I'll be a while with these stupid case profiles.; All right. Night Gerald.; Night sweetie. [Gerald receives a kiss from Sheila]; Hey! Just wanna remind everyone about the ice cream social to benefit homeless teens. Looking for volunteers.; Hey, I'd like to volunteer to kick you in the vagina! Where do I sign up?!; This is my daughter at the triathlon today! Go little girl!; Your daughter has a mustache - what the hell is wrong with your ovaries bitch?!; You've been dick-slapped!; You should've seen what he said about my mother on her Instagram! Pages and pages of disgusting things!; This is an attack on all of us! It's time to make the boys suffer!; It has to be swift and serious. We have to make a statement. The girls in South Park aren't going to be treated like afterthoughts anymore!; Yeah!; This has gone on too long and it's time to do something!; Yeah!; [The boys are now the focus.] What do you think they're talking about?; They're talking about how they're gonna get us - what do you think? That's how the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to, even if you didn't do nothing!; What are we gonna do about them?; The girls want to see Cartman punished so we have to prove it's him.; We're never gonna prove that and you know it! We have to make him stop!; He's not gonna stop, he's loving all this! He wants the girls to hurt us!; Then let's end it.; What do you mean?; Cartman is the cause of all our problems. Always. We all know what has to be done.; It's not like we haven't talked about it before - fantasized about how we'd do it.; Yeah, but not like we'd actually do it.; Clyde's right.; Stan... You can't be thinking that we'd-; What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is.; He pushed everyone too far.; It's him, or us!; Are we seriously talking about doing this?; How would we ever get away with it?; We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go.; 'Sup dudes?; After school, we're gonna go to my uncle's cabin - in the woods. We're gonna have a slumber party and play Counter Strike all night with no one around to bother us.; [Stands up excited] Are you serious?! All night broship Counter Strike party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi?; Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food.; Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever!; 'Member TIE fighters? Oh, 'member Jawas? 'Member? Hey, 'member Jurassic Park? Ooh, you love Jurassic Park. 'Member Jeff Goldblum? Oh, I 'member Jeff Goldblum - he was really tasty. [Mr. Mackey plucks one berry and eats it] I love Jeff Goldblum. 'Member?; Mueeh...; I can't do this anymore! I can't take it!; Oh! Er, hi Scott.[Scott sits on the chair in front of Mr. Mackey.]; Nobody ever pays attention to me! Nobody cares! I just want to end it all!; Scott, come on, we've talked about this. You don't wanna quit Twitter.; Why not?! Everyone would be happier if I did!; Who'd be happier?; Everyone.; Well, what about your parents, huh? How'd you think they'd feel if you quit Twitter?; I don't think they'd even notice!; Of course they'd notice. They'd be saad, m'kay, they'd be saad. You've got so much ahead of you Scott; so many posts and tweets still ahead of you. You haven't even started to see what social media has to offer you. You can't-you can't just end it all. Not now.; You're right, I guess I don't want to quit Twitter.; There you go, m'kay? But now you come back here anytime you're having bad thoughts, m'kay?; Okay, thanks.; Twitter would be better off without me! I'm quitting!; Okay, okay. Now, Scott-[Scott takes the seat again]; What's the point!? Better to just end it all now!; O-kay...; This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing Counter Strike all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Token?; Yeah, I'm really excited.; I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse.; I'm sure you will.; You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?; Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much.; Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play Counter Strike. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now?; We're almost there.; This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome.; Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my God!; [Walks to the man.] What's wrong?; Someone keeps trolling our campaign site!; He just keeps leaving horrible comments, and now he's attacking me personally!; Aww, don't let him get to you.; Don't let him-?! He took a picture I posted and put a dick in my mouth! Who does that?!; Someone who probably still lives with his mother and hates himself. He obviously has nothing better to do. Just let him wallow in his own misery.; 'Member the Cantina? Oh-hoh, I 'member. 'Member Star Destroyers? Yeah, I love Star Destroyers! 'Member?; [To the cashier.] I have a coupon for that too. An-and those are 6 for $4 with this coupon. [To Gerald] Sorry.; Oh, no please. It's no problem at all!; I'm gonna do it! [Mr. Mackey turns a worried, then frustrated look] I'm gonna quit Twitter, I mean it this time!; Ohh, Scott, uh, I-it's sort of after hours, m'kay?; They all laugh at me. They won't be laughing when I do it! I'll show them!; Hah, alright Scott. Come on inside. Huumm...; Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated. [Camera shows a hole and shovel in the ground] Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground.; Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password?; I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box? [Cartman picks up his devices]; You gotta unplug it and plug it back in. [Turning around] You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi...; The girls are gonna do something drastic to us. We have to take matters into our own hands.; What are you...What are you guys talking about - What-; You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry.; Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online!; Just put your stuff on the table and step back.; Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please!; Let's just get it over with!; No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't!; I can't listen to this!; Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff!; Let's just get it over with! [Walks up to Cartman]; No please! If I can't get online, I won't-how would I-I- Mumbling.; No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!!; Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!; What have we done?; What we had to do.; [Off screen.] Iaahh!!; Oh, Goddammit. You've got to be kidding me. [Sighs, then answers phone.] This is Counselor Mackey. What's going on Scott?; I swear to God I'm gonna do it this time.; Okay Scott, just try to calm down. You don't want to quit Twitter.; Why does it matter? People would be happier if I just did it!; That's not true, no one would be happier. [Brings the phone away from his face.]; This fucking kid, oh my god... [Brings the phone back to his ear.] Everybody thinks you're a great kid, Scott.; I-I talked to my dad. He said, ""I don't have the guts to do it!"". Well, if I'd quit Twitter, he'd be sorry!; Okay, umm, how 'bout this, just umm, promise me you won't quit Twitter tonight, and we can - we can talk all day tomorrow, okay? M'kay?; I don't know if I'll make it through the night!; [off phone] Oh, for fuck's sake...; I just feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, you know, and being chased by hate. And the only way out is to jump!; [on phone] Uh-huh, okay, go on with that.; I keep thinking about what the kids at school would do, when they find out I left all my social media. Like they would finally see all the damage they've done.; [off phone] Goddammit, just do it already...; Another internet troll is wreaking havoc on message boards, this time attacking a Danish website for women with breast cancer.; I made the news...; The troll, who goes by the name ""SkankHunt42"", ...; [He claps his hands.] Yes!; ...caused the website to temporarily shutdown. Danish Olympic Gold Medalist Freja Ollegard, who started the website, spoke out about the incident. [The inset video of Freja Ollegard zooms in.]; I am not shocked. I am not sad. I am not giving this pitiful person the satisfaction of being anything. [Gerald listens intently].; This little troll can have his fun. I am going to be the bigger person. I am going to show the people of Denmark are not so easily broken down.; Hmm...Game on whore. Game on.; What's going on?; You didn't hear?; Hear what?; The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night!; No, that's impossible!; It wasn't him Kyle! We took Cartman out for no reason. [Cartman walks past looking down] We can't undo what we've done.; Oh my God. Oh my God...; The time has come. We said if the trolling didn't stop, there would be severe consequences. Get the word out to every girl in school. It goes down tomorrow!; Oh my God...I don't know if I can go through with this.; We all have to be on-board Wendy. Every girl in school, or it means nothing.; Don't forget what you said Wendy: ""For too long girls here have taken the backseat! Things have to change!"". Now they'll have to listen."

Freja, you've talked about being trolled on the Internet and its consequences.; Yes, Heidi. I believe trolling has a tragic effect on innocent people.; You have been the victim of horrific degrading attacks, spearheaded by a troll called [puts on her glasses] skankhunt42.; [watching on his computer, holding a glass of wine] Nice.; I've tried to just ignore the trolls, but that only seems to make them attack me more.; It must be so awful for you to create a Web site for women like yourself who are breat-cancer survivors and these... monsters get on and somehow make light of it. Even going as far as... ridiculing masdectomies.; Yes, it's very disgusting, but I still try very hard to believe in the goodness of humanity. [cheers from teh studio audience.]; I can tell you that the support for you on our Web site has been overwhelming. We'd like to share some comments we've received, many from doctors who believe your Web site is saving lives. The first is a comment from a physician in Spain: ""You go girl. You are doing great things. Don't let trolling stop you."" And that is from Dr. Juerdior Titsgo [Freja is alarmed at the name], in Spain.; [exults at his coup] He shoots, he scores! [Freya knows she's been trolled again and puts her face in her palm]; And there's this one: ""Believe in yourself and don't listen to the haters. You're an inspiration."" That's from Hungarian physician Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff.; Oh no...; HA! [throws an air ball] From the 3-point line!; I'm sorry, am I missing something?; Oh! Police! [sheepishly] Yes?; Hello, sir, we're conducting an investigation.; Uh... regarding... uh regarding what?; Do you happen to know this child? [shows him Cartman's picture from Photo Day]; [relieved] Hoooh. Sure, that's one of my son's friends.; Well, I'm afraid he's... quit Twitter.; Hooo... another one, huh?; Yeah, but this one's different. The events surrounding his quitting Twitter were very suspicious. Most people that quit Twitter leave at least three paragraphs stating that they're quitting Twitter before they quit Twitter. This child just stopped using it.; Kyle! [looks up the stairs]; We're simply trying to gather information on whether this was a Twitter suicide or a Twitter homicide. [Kyle appears at the top of the stairs]; Kyle, have you seen your friend Eric online?; [panics a bit] No. Uh, he quit.; D'ya happen to know why, son?; He probably got fed up with all the negativity and decided to end it. [shrugs] I don't know.; Without tweeting a goodbye? People don't just quit social media. They post long drawn-out messages on social media, explaining why they're leaving social media.; Look, officers, why don't you just go ask him why he quit Twitter?; At where, sir? at where?; Okay, that was the cops! The cops were here!; The cops? For what?; You know for what! You know what we did to Cartman! [he's video-chatting with the other boys on his computer, in several windows]; We did what we had to do.; But we were wrong!; [under his bed covers] It's not the police we have to worry about, it's Eric. He's gonna get us; Hey. W-we all just have to stay cool, okay?; It doesn't matter. He's comin'. He's comin' to get us.; Stan? [Stan's door is open, so Randy walks in] You can't just stay in your room all day.; What happened, Dad? [Randy walks up to the bed] Everything's upside down. [Randy sits] Everyone's taking sides and splitting into groups. [thoughtfully] Everything sucks.; [rubs the back of his neck] Yeah, everything sucks. [lowers his hand] Everyone's divided. Nobody's getting along. And there's people like your MOTHER who are thinking of voting for a DOUCHE because she doesn't have a BRAIN.; [off screen] Go to hell, Randy!; I don't know what's wrong with people in this town. More and more are agreeing with your mother. I tried getting on community message boards and swaying people's minds but... it always ends up with some asshole talking about vaginas and photoshopping a dick in my mouth. That's where we're at today. Everything sucks.; Here's everything to prepare you for the debates, ma'am. Just try and stay focused no matter what your opponent says.; Don't let him rattle you. He's gonna do whatever he can to try and mess with your head. Bon't buy into it. Whatever he says, just respond with ""My opponennt is a liar, and he cannot be trusted.""; Got it.; Decision 2016. The first Presidential debate, with moderator Lester Holt.; Okay, let's get right into it. Our first question is for you, sir. How will you deal with ground troops in Syria?; Everyone, I need to just speak from the heart here. Uhm, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I've gotta come clean. Uh, I had no idea I would get this far, [Holt looks confused] but the fact of the matter is, I should not be President. Okay? [Clinton's aides watch from a back room] I will fuck this country up beyond repair. [Clinton's aides smile at this admission] I'm a sick, angry little man. Please, if you care at all about the future of our country, vote for her. Okay? She's the one who at least has some experience. She, she's not as bad as you think, I promise. And unlike me, she's actually capable of running this country.; ...My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted.; NOOO!; Oh my God, she's such a turd sandwich.; What he is saying is simply not true. Do not... believe it.; [throws his hands up and then faces Clinton] I am giving you this, lady. I AM GIVING you this! What the fuck are you doing?! [faces the audience again] Okay, look, look, just, vote for her, she... she knows politics. She really wants to put this country first.; My opponent is a liar-; Would you just please shut up?; -And he cannot be-; Get out of your own way.; -cannot be trusted.; [in exasperation] Okay, okay, look. [stands up again] She doesn't mean what she's saying. She just doesn't know how to take this because... it's very weird and her advisers probably t-; My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted. [as she says this, he throws his hands up and turns his back to the camera]; Fuck, oh fuck, why the fuck does it have to be her? I am so fucked.; Alright boys, I've had just about enough of playing games. [before him are Kyle, Stan, Butters, and Token] The four of you were good friends with Eric Cartman, and yet none of you seem to know why he left social media. [Butters fidgets a bit] Nobody's get anything to say? Well I have a theory. I think... that Eric Cartman... was somehow forced to leave social media as a retaliation for Heidi Turner quitting social media! Now, because of the actions of one sexist, bogoted, racist troll! [sweeps his hand across his desk and knocks a stack of papers to the floor]; [lets out a] Eeeaaaahhhh!; We have a gender war on our hands! Make no mistake, gentlemen! Our community is under attack! And if we don't get to the bottom of it... there's gonna be more students like Eric Cartman... wandering the hallways with no connection to the rest of the world.; [gruff whisper] Eric. [he looks up. By some exit doors is Heidi]; Heidi? Heidi Turner?; Come with me.; Where? [she turns and walks off to her left]; Join us. [points to a park] here.; The park?; I know how you feel, Eric. I know how hard it is when school gets out. With no phone, no human contact.; [begins to cry] I miss my stuff.; Come on. There are others like us here. [guides him into the park. A car appears and slows down]; Look at them, Martha. Do you see them?; What are they?; Lost souls who have quit Twitter. Damned to just wander the earth and hang out and stuff.; They seem so lonely. [they both look at their phones]; Okay, what?! The fuck?! Is wrong with you people?! I just saw a new poll that says more and more of you are thinking about voting for that douche!; Some are. A lot of people like what he has to say, alright?; You're tellin' me that after that debate, you still wanna vote for that guy?!; More than ever.; Yyyup.; Did you see the same debate I saw?!; Don't you get it, Randy? There's people in this country who are sick and tired. Tired of hearing all the rhetoric. Tired of Washington failing us while they pat their own backs. Finally someone comes along and says what he feels. That's why people like him. You can say what you want, at least he doesn't sound like another politician.; America, please listen to me. I have no idea how to be President. I am a complete jackass, and I have made a giant mistake here. [the crowd cheers his honesty, which stuns him] Nononono, nononono, why are you clapping? I'm not a good person for the White House. I am not a good person, period.; Finally, someone who doesn't talk like a politician.; I am peeing my pants... at the thought of being President, okay? [more cheers go up] No! Shut up! Listen to me! [the crowd quiets down] You don't want a guy like me in the White House! You don't even wanna know the shit I've done!; Wooohooo!; I have scissored with another woman when I had a sex change!; He's so honest!; No, no! I'm not the guy you want going to Russia to negotiate with Putin. I'll probably end up gettin' drunk and tryin' to suck his dick. [more cheering. He turns away from the mic] OHHHH JEEEZ; Ike, got a minute? [enters and sits on Ike's bed] Let's talk, buddy. [Ike pauses his game and goes to his bed] You know, the school really wants us to keep talking to our kids about trolling on the Internet and how serious it is. I guess the troll from the school message boards is now harassing a famous Olympic athlete from Denmark, heh. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah well, she kinda called him out and said he could never get her to quit social media, and you know, you might say she's askin' for it. But uh, now this troll is being copied by other trolls who are all dog piling to see if they can get her to quit and, well God only knows what they're gonna do tonight. Well, goodnight, pal. You be sure to let your mom know we talked more about the horrific consequences of trolling. [steps outside, then leans back and smiles at Ike, then leaves and closes the door]; I want to tell you... that I'm sorry.; For what?; When women first started getting trolled on the school message boards. I was sure it was you. I was wrong.; You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.; So when you held the assembly that woman were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?; [earnestly] Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind.; Do you miss your friends?; I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.; You do now. [smiles at him]; Kewl.; Hello Florida! Please put your hands together and welcome the next President of the United States! [makes way for Mr. Garrison]; I hate all of you so much.; Yeah!; I seriously hold so much contempt for each and every one of you pieces of shit. [cheers] If you vote me in as President I'll seriously throw up and have lost all faith in humanity. [more cheers]; [watching on TV] I agree.; I don't wanna be here. Please just let me go. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything. I'm scared. I'm completely clueless how to proceed. I just... spew bullshit and cry myself to sleep at night. Stop thinking that I'm anything more than a douche in over his head. For fuck's sake, please.; Shit, I'm startin' to really like this guy.; And after stating that he was not fit to be President, Secretary Clinton responded with ""My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted.""; I am so confused.; In other news tonight, Danish gold medalist Freja Øllengård is the apparent victim of extreme trolling once again. [Gerald walks into the bar and watches the report]; Oh. Eh hey, can you turn that up?; The athlete from Denmark has been the target of relentless online attacks that began with the troll skankhunt42. [Gerald smiles and looks around to see if anyone has figured out it was him who's the troll] Last night the trolling took a vicious turn when Freja Øllengård finally succumbed to the pressure and committed suicide. [Gerald's smile vanishes.]; Paul, Danish women's volleyball champion Freja Øllengård has been pronounced dead outside her apartment in Copenhagen. [there's fear in Gerald's face] The four-time girls' medal winner took her own life after jumping 17 floors off the balcony of her building. [footage is shown of her doing this, with a klieg light focused on her all the way down. She lands on a car and shatters, blood going all over the place. The car's alarm turns on]; Freja Øllengård, dead at the age of 38. [Quickly, Gerald runs to the restroom and into a stall. A patron watches him enter and continues doing so until the scene ends]; [on the toilet seat] Oh my God! Oh shit! Oh shit oh my God! Oh God oh no-oohh!; I was wrong, Stephen, I'm votin' for your guy.; [surprised] What?; It's just... [walks in] I see what you mean. He talks like an ordinary person. And he has a lot of the same emotions I do, you know? He's got my vote.; Are you out of your fuckin' mind?; [turns around] What?; You wanna vote for that douche?! He'll ruin this country!; You were just voting for him yesterday!; Yeah, but not anymore!; What happened??; I don't know.; What the hell is wrong with people?! You just don't flip back and forth like that?!; You just did.; [processes that reply] ...I did. What's going on, Stephen? Why does everything suck this hard?; I don't know. Nobody knows what to think anymore.; But how did we get here? Completely confused and with shit for choices? It's like... it's like there are other forces at work.; I'm just tired of thinkin' about it. Come on, let's relax and' have some member berry pie.; [thinks a moment] Member berry pie... [drops the thought] Okay, I love member berries. [follows Stephen to the dining room table]; 'Member Tattooine? 'Member the torture droid? I 'member? Hi, 'member Goonies? I loooved Goonies. 'Member Chunk? 'Member? 'Member the trash compactor? Oh, the trash compactor.; [picks some berries up with a spoon, but stops] Wait a minute... [a camera pans away from the Stotch house into space, then moves east to Europe, then zooms in on Denmark.]; [in a Danish accent] Citizens of Denmark, we are under attack. As our ancestors did in days long ago, we must rise to defend our families. [Freja's casket is slowly brought to the altar outside the cathedral] A troll has come into our village and taken from us a beloved princess. He then returned to his secret hiding place, crawled back to his little cave, thinking the Danes would simply cry and run. [a mourner sobs] No. What this troll doesn't realize is that we have been planning our own attack. I'm announcing here and to the world that a plan to destroy the troll is underway. For in Denmark there is one thing we have known for centuries. To get the troll to come out of hiding, you must say its name.; Hey.; Hey. [long pause] I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.; Why is that?; Because, black laughs matter.; ...Is that a joke?; Yes, it is.; I don't get it.; Yes, you do. [Heidi just looks downward] Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?; The hardest part is not having any followers. I used to go places just to show them where I was.; You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. [Heidi smiles]; Mornin'. How can I help ya?; Yeah, I have some questions about uh member berries?; Yeah'. Everyone wants member berries these days. [turns left and walks off] Right over heah. [Randy joins him] Don't know what makes them so popular. I've had to get rid of all mah pumpkins, mah onions and mah peppahs, just to make room for more membah berries. [the voices of member berries get louder as they approach the berry grove. There are berries as far as the eye can see.]; Oh my God, there's this many?; 'Member the 80s? Oh, 'member the 90s? Yeah yeah, but 'member the 80s though? Nonono, 'member the 90s?; Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Protocol Zero. No evidence, clear history. E-mails! delete, delete, delete, erase, erase, trash, trash. [reaches into his glove compartment and pulls out a hammer called ""Protocol Zero."" He leaves the car with phone and hammer in tow. An elderly woman draw near as he smashes the phone to bits on the roof of his car. Once he's destroyed the phone, he gets into his car and peels out. He rushes home and runs up to his office. He turns on his computer and begins to delete stuff in the Gerald folder he has on there. After that he opens up the computer and pulls out the hard drive. He takes the computer apart, puts it all in a duffel bag and drives to Stark's Pond, where he sets up a portable foot-operated catapult and launches the duffel bag into the pond. He quickly rushes home again and sites next to Sheila on the couch. Sheila just glances at him]; I saw Nancy Morris today. She has a different hair color. Again. I swear she doesn't think anyone even notices. Her natural hair color must be clear.; [rushed] Our computer's broke.; ...What?; It broke and I had to throw it away.; I thought if a computer isn't working, you try and get it fixed.; No now you just throw it away.; You had all my recipes on that FileMaker program on your computer.; I'll get us a new computer tomorrow. Then I can see if we can pull your recipes up from Ike's computer, and that way we- Ike's computer! Shit! [runs upstairs]; Move move move! [pushes Ike out of the way and gets to work] My computer is off the network, and, and this computer didn't mirror that computer, but they did share the same Time Machine schedule, so then, would any of my files be accessible? No, because they didn't know each other's IP addresses. What if you can access my e-mail account from this computer through iCloud? If I go to iCloud, my e-mails are deleted. Good. Except there's a new e-mail. [It's from unknown] That shouldn't have come in. Why would an e-mail to me have come in if I deleted everything? [he reads the e-mail. It says the same thing the note did] ""I know who you are."" [spins around and points at Ike] You? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am, Ike?; No, but I want to, Dad.; [thinks of the Biblical sense] Not like that, smartass! [turns back to the computer and works on his account] Delete! Delete the account, not the e-mails! [gets an e-mail: ""You have a Google alert!"" He clicks OK and reads] ""meet me under the freemont bridge. 9 am tomorrow."" [panics] Oh God...; You dip your French fries in the sweet & sour sauce?; Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it.; [tries it and eats] Wow, that's really good. I'm starting to feel like life isn't gonna be so bad.; Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?; Yeah, of course.; Do girls... not have balls?; Girls do not have balls, no; So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work? [she wonders why he's asking] I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina.; [munches on a fry] Do you want me to show you?; ...Holy shiiit."

[A troll is seen] The Troll. They dwell in rocks, in caves, isolated from civilization. The creatures were ugly, fat and slow-witted, but some could look and behave like human beings. These are the most dangerous. Now, the creatures have returned, this time, a thousand miles across the sea. [Earth is seen as it rotates. It zooms in on America, and an internet troll is seen] Today, the monsters believe they can go undetected, [Different trolls are seen] free to attack and then retreat to the darkness. But in Denmark, we have dealt with the trolls before, and now and now, we shall deal with them... again.; Dad, can I talk to you?; Sure, Kyle.; All the girls at school are really mad. It's like, one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us.; Uh huh.; Everyone's sad, everyone's depressed and nobody knows how to move forward.; Good.; I guess what I'm saying is, I'm starting to feel a lot of guilt, just for being a boy. How do I not feel that?; Sorry Kyle, I have to meet someone. Talk to your mother. [gets off the couch] I love you! [walks away]; It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now.; Butters,I'm sorry, but I told you not to Skype me anymore, right?; [becomes shocked] But Baby, I love you! I need you! You can't break up with me!; I have to stand with my girlfriends.; Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you. [starts shouting] Those sneaky snakes in the grass!; Who?!; Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them!; This is a time when women and girls have to stick together.; So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every [slams the keyboard] last one of you!; [ends the call]; Oh Charlotte? [presses on the mouse] Are you there? [presses on the mouse] Honey?; [takes off his sunglasses] I don't know why you are harassing me. I don't even own a computer.; My name is Dick.; Are you with the NSA or Homeland Security?; No! I'm a colleague.; A colleague?; You probably know me as ""Dildo Shwaggins"".; Dildo Shwaggins from Pussystores.org?!; We need to talk.; You're just a troll?! [turns to his left, raises his arms, and looks up] Oh thank god!; We're on the same team, Skankhunt.; [lowers his hand] Wait, but that means I went ""Protocol Zero"" for nothing. Oh shit [throws his cup of coffee]!; What's ""Protocol Zero""?; [circles around and then sits] Everything's gone! I destroyed my computers, my phone! [looks at Dick] Why couldn't you just say, ""I know who you are. I'm a troll too,""? Why do you have to be so fucking cryptic?!; Us trolls have to be careful. You know that.; Look, I'm not really a troll, okay? I just started as a Yelp reviewer and got sick of how everyone's stupid comments sounded. I just like messing with people 'cause it was funny. I got carried away!; These are really dangerous times, Skankhunt. There are there are things happening in the world and trolls have to come together.; For what?; Someone is trying to wipe us out! Our way of life is in danger.; It's not a way of life! I was just doing it for the LOLs.; That's not true. I've studied your work. You're one of the best trolls I have ever seen.; [stands up] No, no! I am done with this crap. I thought my wife was going to find out, [grabs his sunglasses] but that was too spooky. [puts on his sunglasses and walks away].; Gerald, we need each other. The Danish [raises his arms] are planning something horrible against us.; [stops and faces Dick] I'm not one of you, okay? I just need to stop. [tries to climb up the steep dirt, but falls down].; [talks while pacing back and forth] Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot and ... we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them. There's a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support.; You really think that's gonna make a difference?; I do. We need to show the girls that not all boys aren't the same and that we are willing to change. [stops pacing]; Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle? [talks while walking] All I've been hearing in a few weeks is how [stops walking]this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right!; Butters?; [turns towards and points at him] This is a war [walks from Kyle] on all of us. You want to listen to Uncle Kyle, we'll go ahead. Pretty soon [stops walking, and faces Tweek and Craig] they'll be locking us all up. And don't think you're safe either, Tweek and Craig. Just 'cause you're gay does not mean that you aren't looked down upon for being boys! [turns to his left] The world wants us all to feel shame just because we were all born with [points downwards] wieners!; Butters, you need to calm down.; No! [walks towards Kyle] We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us?; Nowhere.; [turns around] Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours!; That's true!; I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind, [points at Kyle] or are you with Uncle Kyle.; Gerald, you've been sitting at the table for three hours now. You okay?; [stops tapping] I'm great! Totally good. Just sitting down and ... doing nothing. Is there a problem with that? Is there a problem with just wanting to sit and just be? Is that illegal now?; Not at all, Gerald. I'm sorry.; I'm totally happy. I'm happy. I don't need to do anything to make me happy, fuck.; Well! I know you said your computer was broken. So, I went ahead and got you something. [takes out iPad from a bag] Here, it's your own iPad.; [gets frightened, stands up and tries walking away from Sheila] Ah! Ah ah, ah! No, no! I'm good. Get that away from me.; [turns to her husband] You don't like it?; No, sorry! I love it! I'm just swearing off electronics for a little bit. [leans closer to the iPad and speaks softer in a harsh tone] Or maybe I can just get on a couple of message boards. [backs away and speaks normally] No, I'm good! I don't need it!; Gerald, [walks closer to Gerald] what's going on?; Nothing, Sheila. I'm fine. [turns so his body faces the table] I'm just trying to make some changes and less electronics is part of it. I'm sorry, Honey. Everything is okay. Promise.; Okay, Gerald. I'll make us some lunch. [walks to the kitchen] Oh uh, did that guy outside talk to you?; [faces the front window] What guy outside? [walks towards the window and sees Dick on the other side of the road from his house] What the fuck? [checks on Sheila and then whispers to Dick] Go away, go! [waves his arms sideways] Go! Go away! Go go!; [shows a note to Gerald that says ""WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK"", then drops the paper to show the other note saying ""IT'S IMPORTANT""]; [whispers quickly, closes the blind and curtains of the window, and then walks away]; Welcome students and parents to tonight's matchup between the South Park Cows and the Bona Festa Demons.; Dude, this is awesome! Did you see how many of the boys I've got to come out tonight?!; Yeah! This is a pretty sweet turnout!; [smiles at Stan]; This is exactly what we needed. Thank god people listen to me.; [blows whistle]; And now please sit, stand, or kneel for the National Anthem.; [takes off his pants and underwear, pulls his shirt, and raises his fist causing people to be shocked]; Holy crap, dude. Look at Butters.; Oh [hits his face] no!; [walks through town depressed and then quickly dodges a bicyclist] Son a bitch! Ahhh! [walks near the Community Center, reads a sign about addiction problems, and checks the group]; Gerald. Hey come on in. You're not alone, bud. We're all facing the same struggles and trying to do something about it. Anyways please continue, Richard.; [sits on the available chair to the right of Randy]; Well like I was saying, I've been addicted to memberberries for the past two months now.; It's okay, man. You're not alone.; It's just, you know, 'membering is more fun than thinking. I want so bad to go back to when things were good. When I was a kid, you know like, the 80s and the 90s, and things made sense.; And that's how we got here to this very memberberry election.; What is this?!; What have been your struggles with memberberries, Gerald?; I, I don't even know what a member--.; [muffled from Michael's pocket] 'Member the Dagobah? Yeah, I remember the Dagobah. That's where Yoda lives. 'Member Yoda?! Oh, I 'member!; [coughs] Michael, are there memberberries in your pocket?; Oh, 'member Corellian Corvette?! I remember Corellian Corvette!; [sqishes the memberberries] Nope!; Anyway, Gerald, what has your experience been?; I don't even know what memberberries are.; Gerald, come on. The first step towards healing is admitting you've got a problem.; Yeah. [stands up and points at Stephen] Well you've got a fat pussy, and you should go and fucking kill yourself! [calms down] Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place. [walks away]; Make no mistake! I want to be very upset. However, as a community, we have all decided that people have the right to protest the National Anthem.; They took their wieners out!; [points upwards] Correct! [lowers his arms] But they did so peacefully and without malice towards others.; This was an attack on us. This is exactly why we sat out the National Anthem in the first place!; I want you to understand something, ladies. [positions his hands parallel from each other] I am in a PC Pretzel here because if I say [moves his hands to his right] they can't protest even though [moves his hands to the left of him] you protested [moves his hand back towards the middle] and the only difference is that their protest included physical gestures, then I'm body shaming!; So you're just gonna let the boys take their wieners out whenever they want?; That's what happens when you sit out the National Anthem.; [speaks through a microphone while rallying a group of boys with their pants pulled out] We walk together in peace! We walk together in peace! We're not poor for feeling ashamed in who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out!; Wieners out!; Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow nice because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing!; Yeah!; What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry!; [runs away from the rally]; Wieners out!; Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are!; [pulls down his pants and joins the rally]; You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple!; [whispers] Damn it! [waves his arms away from the window] I live here! Stop that! [shuts the curtains and lies on the bed next to Sheila]; [stops reading and faces Gerald] You don't have to work tonight?; No, nothing!; Wow! I don't remember the last time you were able to get in bed the same time as me.; Got all caught up with work!; Hey, I'm not complaining. [closes her book] It feels good to have you here.; [gets off the bed and runs away] I'm going on a run!; [gets surprised by the car honking at him] Ah! [raises his fist] Fuck you! [""flips"" his index fingers] Fuck you!; [talks from the master bathroom] Yeah!; [fully wakes up]; Screw you, Skank! You fat little bitch! Go kill yourself, whore!; [gets off bed and walks near the master bathroom].; Yeah, fuck you, bitch! Fuck you! [chuckles]; Gerald? [opens the door, gets scared of the Gerald's creepy face, screams, and runs away]; [lays iPad in the sink and chases Sheila] Oh, sorry, Hun! Sorry!; Everyone all right, guys?; Everything's fine, Kyle. Go back to bed.; [wipes her eyes with tissue] One night you, you say all of our computer stuff is broken and you, you hide everything and then you show up with all of this new equipment and now this! Please, tell me what's going on!; Nothing is going on!; [points at Gerald] You hissed at me! You went [faces to her right, hisses, and then faces back at him].; Okay, okay. I'm going to tell you the truth, Sheila. I watch porn on the Internet. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop.; But I know you watch porn. You told me you watched porn and I told you that I don't care, Gerald.; Oh yeah! But uh, it's uh, but this is different.; Why?! Because it's not normal porn?; Right!; Like something really embarrassing?; It's really embarrassing.; Tell me!; It's... porn! It's... uh, piss! Porn! Piss porn!; Piss porn? Like people peeing on each other?; [stands up] See?! [walks closer to Sheila] It's so embarrassing! No wonder I hid it, right?! [wipes his forehead] Whew! [moves closer to Sheila] I'm sorry! It's good to get it out in the open though. [walks to bed]; Do you want me to pee on you?; [stops and turns around] No!; You only like watching other women pee?; [walks closer to Sheila] Oh no, no! It's not like that.; [turns around] Because they're pretty? You have to watch around a video because I'm overweight and old?; No! I, I, I want you to! I just couldn't ask.; You do, promise? [faces Gerald]; [in complete shock] Yes?; Am I doing it right, Gerald?; Yep! [gnarls]; [watches Gerald and Sheila from the hallway]; So hot, I mean [gnarls] warm! [gnarls some more]; [walks behind Ike and gets shocked by Gerald and Sheila's actions]; Hi, Cartman.; [looks at Kyle] Hey, Kyle.; I'm so sorry, what we did to you. This Internet troll has everyone going crazy. We shouldn't have assumed it was you. We shouldn't have broke all of your stuff.; Cool. That's cool.; No! I know it's not cool. I know you're figuring out how to get back at us.; I saw a vagina, Kyle.; What?!; I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose.; You saw who's vagina?; My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.; [lays his hand on his forehead] Yeah right, okay. [lowers his hand] I'm being serious, Cartman. Butters needs to be taken down a notch and you're the best at that.; [overlaps Kyle's last few words and approaches Eric] Eric, hey! I got us both chocolate milks.; [stands up and talks to Heidi] Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you.; The pink and blue one?!; That's what my baby wanted.; [raises her arms and cheers] Yay, [lowers her arms] put it on me!; [puts the necklace on Heidi and faces Kyle] Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle?; [faces Kyle] Oh yeah. Hey, Kyle. [talks to Eric while they hold hands] The show's on at five tonight if you want to watch it at your house or my house.; Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um. [talks to Kyle] Go ahead, Kyle.; [in complete shock] The, the school is in trouble and, um our friends are...; He said something about us working together to take down Butters.; Why? What's going on, Boo?; I'm not sure, Boo. [faces Kyle] Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? [faces Heidi] Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.; [pauses in complete shock]; It wasn't suppose to be like this. I just thought it was funny making people get wild up. It was just stupid-harmless-lock-room humor, till I made that lady kill herself.; [sighs] You can't deny who you are, Skankhunt.; [speaks softer and faces Dick] Don't call me that here! Why can't you just go away?!; Because we're all in danger. Didn't you see the video I sent you?; No! Don't you get it?! I went ""Protocol Zero""! I broke my phone, I delete all my email accounts so that nobody can trace me [faces away from the bench] ever again!; They will be able to, [faces Gerald] everyone. You need to see this video, Skankhunt. The whole world is about to change.; [talks to Kyle] You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like ""Women aren't funny,"" even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.; Shut up.; [talks to Heidi] No, it's true. Get over yourself.; [starts to get bored]; I don't even try to be funny.; I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.; Cartman, will you just help me mess with Butters to stop his little agroclub from getting any bigger?; [talks to Kyle] Like mess with Butters how? [lifts mug] What do you mean ""mess with Butters""? [drinks from mug]; You know what I mean. Come on! We need the old Cartman back!; [gets mad] Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi.; What?; You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.; That's not true at all!; [talks sarcastically] Oh she's not funnier than you, [speaks with anger] or is she just not funny because she's a girl?; Babe, stop. I don't think he meant anything by it.; [talks to Heidi] Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.; [talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, I think it's great you're trying to patch things up with everyone, but the truth is Eric and I are just kind of out of it now.; [talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now.; We gave up social media and the ugliness that goes along with it and we're in a better place.; Humans on Mars.; I'm warning you, Skankhunt, [takes out his laptop and types] this video is really gonna rock your world.; [talks softer] Can you please call me ""Gerald""?!; [gives Gerald his laptop] It's very obscure news story from the BBC in England. Hardly anyone has seen it over here. [presses a button and faces away from the bench] This is why we all have to come together, Skank.; Since the dawn of the Internet, message boards and chat rooms have lit up with people who insight and insult for no apparent reason. They're called [picture of guy with an actual troll behind him is shown] trolls, and a controversial company in Denmark is working to make them a thing of the pass. ""The days of trolls hiding behind nicknames and message boards are over!"" the Danish claim. [Danish music is played] As a new website, [Troll Trace headquarters is shown] Trolltrace.com will soon be up and running. In less than a month, the servers will become active. Anyone can take any troll comment and send it through the Danish service where a real name and real physical address will be attached.; [World spinning with the word ""STIMULATION"" is shown] Every message, every comment [comment is scan, world stops spinning, and a tracer is shown] ever made by trolls will retroactively be given a tag [troll's true identity is shown] with the author's name, location, and [police barge into the troll's house] whole Internet history.; [in complete shock] Fffffuuuuuccckkk!; I told you.; And this is the man who has masterminded it all.; What this will allow people to do is trace back harmful and hateful postings or emails. You see, the troll hides behind a protective layer if you will that Internet enmity provides. We intend to strip them of that protection so that everyone will know who they are.; And what about people who will use this to spy on others who aren't trolls?; Uh, what do you mean?; Once your servers become active, anyone can trace anything onto the Internet back to whoever wrote it. How do you stop that from happening?; Oh oh, right. [coughs and faces the camera] This service is only for tracing the identity of trolls. Thank you. Kom ud trold, komme ud og dø.; I Google Translated the last part. He said ""Come out troll, come out and die"".; This can't be happening.; By next week, everything everyone has ever done online is going to be available to the public.; [closes laptop] Then it's over. I'm dead.; [faces Gerald] You're not dead, Skankhunt. There's still hope.; [shouts] Everyone, can I have your attention please?! [everyone has his attention] I know the past few weeks have been very difficult, for all of us. I know now more than ever that something has to change. I thought a lot about this the past few days. I've seen a lot of things I never thought I would have see. These are all complex issues we're all having to face, and now that I know that after you break it down, there's really only one answer. [pulls off his pants, holds his shirt, and raises his arm]; Yeah! [one of them says ""That's right."" as they all gradually pull off their pants]; Good for you, Uncle Kyle!; [takes off the bandana and crumples it in his shirt] Fellow trolls, let me introduce you to Skankhunt42.; I'm not necessarily Skankhunt42.; It's okay, Skank. You're with your kind."

Uh, seems like that might be losing us some votes. [walks away]; [puts his hand under his chin] Oh you don't say?; Ladies and gentlemen, out country's divided like never before. And we all know that only one man has the guts to say what we're all thinking. Please, welcome the man who with your help will soon be the next President of the United States!

[cheers and applause]; Ow!; And the TSA security people all look like black thugs from the inner city; I'm like ""Oh good, you're gonna protect us?"" [laughter] Well maybe it's good they're all gang members. At least they can tell the difference between Muslims and Mexicans, 'cause God knows I can't. [applause] You know, I'm standin' there in line and you know what I do? I stick my finger in this chick's asshole, [applause and laughter] and she turns to me and says, ""Hey, aren't you that guy that's running for President?"" I say Yeah.

[the men are clapping, the women just look at him now] Yeah, let's make America great again. No dude wants his finger in some ugly bitch's ass. [the men laugh] You gotta be careful though, it's only about half an inch away, you know, that asshole and that clam, so you gotta be careful. Right dudes? [A woman gets up and makes her way to the aisle] Oh. Oh, where are you goin'? Are you leavin? [the woman turns right to leave the rally] I'm sorry, did I offend you? Where did I lose you, honey? You've been okay with the ""fuck everyone to death,"" all the Muslim and Mexican shit, but fingers in the ass did it for ya? [she reaches the door and exits] Cool, just wanted to see where your line was! [some more women get up, one of them leaves with her husband] Oh yeah, look, I guess some more broads are leavin'. Oh Jeez you were so on board, I can't believe I let that little offensive mark slip. Poor girls. Did you get your feelings hurt after ""Fuck all the immigrants"" and?"" Jeez, I'm sorry. Jeez.; [in a weird accent] Hello. Are you tired of hate speech? Are you sick of sexism and-a bigotry? Then please, help the Danish put an end to trolls.; Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.; Right now, the people of Denmark are working on a biometric computer superstructure which will allow people all around the world to identify the trolls in their communities.; Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.; But to make this dream into a reality, we still need your donations. We are just a few million kroners away, so please donate via the social media of your choice.; [four windows open and some Danes sing out] Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.; Just imagine it, knowing who said what on the Internet.; The whole world will be-a peaceful and happy.; Like-a here, in Denmark.; Help fund our project on social media today!; Together, we will rid the world of trolls. Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang tjing nutillej!; Fellow trolls, we have gathered together because our anonymity is being threatened. Individually, we are some of the most notorious trolls in Colorado. We must now find a way to unite. Each one of us has the power to make message boards go haywire, The power to make individuals buckle and fall. Imagine if we use those skills against a common enemy.; They have an entire government at their disposal.; And we... have Skankhunt42.; [sighs] It's Gerald. Alright?; I believe that he... is the key to stopping all this.; Alright everyone, listen up. This school is falling apart, and it needs to stop. Boys are harassing girls, and girls are stereotyping boys as- Not now, Mr. Stotch! Put it away!; [with his pants down and dick out] Well okay. [pulls his pants back up.]; Now I've asked for some ideas and a couple of students wanna try and help. Please welcome Heidi and Eric. [they come up wearing matching shirts: ""COME TOGETHER as a school""]; Hey you guys?; What's up? [the other kids stay silent]; Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny.; Eheh, stop, Eric.; You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby.; Thanks, babe. I don't know if you guys have heard, but right now, Denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past. They're asking for help, and I thought ""why not a school fundraiser?""; Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?; What? How did I say it? [from here their voices get softer and softer until they're whispering to each other]; Remember, you were like ""Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?"" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh-; When was this? Were we at Denny's?; Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?; [giggling] Oh, and you kept spilling it and everything?; Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it; He had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head.; Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...; Then we should all come together [mimicking Cartman] as a skewl. [Cartman giggles and sighs happily. Bebe throws up involuntarily]; Sir, what were you thinking? We said to be careful how you talked about women.; [satisfied with himself] Yeah I don't know, I guess I just kind of screwed the pooch on that one. [checks for any Pabst Blue Ribbon cans with beer left in them]; We are way down in the polls. I don't know how we recover from this.; Oh really? Jeez that's too bad. [dusts off his pants and checks his shoes]; A lot of us have staked our lives on backing you! You can't just go bonkers like this!; Hey, sorry. I didn't realize women were racists.; You have... millions of supporters who are looking to you to lead! They're gonna wanna know what you're gonna do about this!; I mean, I don't know. Nothin'. Whatever.; You wanna tell them that? They're outside. [Garrison is horrified.]; What's goin' on?!; What are ya doin?!; [steps outside] Oh, uh hey everybody. Uh, looks like we're tanking in the polls, but you know what? It's fixed. I was never gonna win in the first place. I knew it from the beginning. And on November 8th, when I lose, I'll be able to say ""I told you so!"" [grins. The crowd is not amused.]; This son of a bitch pulled a fast one on us!; It's like he's not even trying!; Oh no, I'm I'm trying. I just-; Get him!; Shiiit! [he runs off, and the crowd gives chase] Ohhh Jeeez! [people in the crowd come armed with shovels, pitchforks, bats, axes, knives, guns... One person even has a chainsaw he has trouble starting up.]; Kill him! Tear his head off! Don't let him get away!; [ginally gets that chainsaw going] Yeah haw!; [knocks on the door]; What do you want? Go away.; Hey, just checking to see if you needed any more refreshments for the conference room?; We're fine. We don't need anything.; [within the room] Some more creamer?; Just some more creamer.; Alright, well, I just wanna say ""thanks for choosing the-"" [the troll shuts the door]; Okay, we're clear again.; You were saying, Skankhunt?; Alright, look. How do you troll somebody?; Say really fucked up shit and make them quit social media?; No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh.; Wow... that seems kind of... mean.; It's not mean if it's hilarious.; If we all worked with you, Skank, could we do it? Could we troll an entire country?; If we all worked together? Maybe. [makes a fist with his left hand] Maybe.; Hey guys. Today we're gonna start our school fundraiser. It's an idea I came up with called ""Danishes for Denmark.""; [almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome.; We need everyone to do their part, so later on in the cafeteria, we are all gonna need to- [the classroom door opens and Heidi looks to see who opened it. Mr. Garrison rushes in and gets to work immediately]; [frantic] Okay children, let's take our seats! Let's uh, get back to our lessons on grammar, shall we?; Mr. Garrison?; Okay, does anybody, uh, remember where we left off? No? Alright, uh, who can tell me what an adjective is? [to Mrs. Nelson] You can go now, I'm back. [to the class] Who can t-who can tell me what an adjective is?; Uh, aren't you running for President?; Adjectives usually come before what? They come before nouns, that's right.; [clears his throat] Mr. Garrison, you can't just act like nothing happened! You're spiraling out of control, and you have to answer to the people!; I don't know what you're talking about! I am a teacher! [back to the board] Okay, adjectives describe nouns, and there are several types of them-; Mr. Garrison.; What are some examples of adjectives you can give me for this sentence? Anybody? [writes ""Jack threw the ball."" on the board.]; You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison, and you have to make good on it!; The yellow ball. That's a good one. Or we can say ""the slippery ball,"" can't we?; Come on. [his advisers come in.]; What else about the ball? No, please! [The advisers gather around him and carry him off] What else can we say about the ball, children? No, please! Leave me alone!; The bouncy ball?; [grabs a chalk stick and scratches it against the blackboard] No! No, I'm not going back! Please! They're gonna kill me, children! Please! Help me, children! Help me! [Chris Christie shuts the door]; Okay, come on. Office is upstairs. [they run into Sheila] Oh, hi honey.; Gerald, you're back from your convention?; Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up.; Well, can I make you guys somethin' to eat?; Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much! [he and Dick go on upstairs.] Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins.; Hello. [Gerald closes the door]; I gotta hand it to you, Gerald. You have a really nice home, nice family.; Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am.; And who is that?; What?; I've studied your work. You're so good at lashing out at the system. Bringing people down off their high horses. Why do you do it?; I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz.; I don't believe that. I think there's more to Skankhunt. When I was in school, kids teased me. Called me ""midget,"" even though I'm not. My mother was a little person, but she actually married a guy who had gigantism syndrome. She thought, if she was a little person and had a baby with a giant, I would come out normal. [Gerald stifles a laugh] We can't let these Danish pricks take our online lives, Skank. For some of us... it's all we have.; Let's come together as a skewl.; We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that; We came together as a skewl.; Put our difference aside, feeling hope now feeling pride. 
No more fighting, it's time for something new.; Let's come together as a skewl.; I really feel like this is the start of something new! We're gonna help Denmark, and Denmark is gonna put an end to trolls.; And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are.; Let's come together as a skewl.; Terraform Mars.; Oooooohhh. [stops to catch his breath, then sees his advisers and runs again] Oohh!; He went this way!; Get back here! You're acting like an idiot! [Behind the advisers is the crowd of supporters with their weapons]; Get him! String him up! We put our faith in you, asshole!; Test test 1 2. This is Dildo Shwaggins. We are ready to commence the trashing of Denmark. All trolls report in.; PurpleheadedQueeflicker standing by.; [voice over] Che Gamorrah standing by.; MLKKK and I'm ready.; Anonymous821 signed in to multiple accounts and standing by.; [voice over] URFATANDDUM standing by.; SuperSexyLisa18 standing by.; [voice over] YourMomsTits standing by.; Skankhunt42 standing by.; Okay. everyone follow Skankhunt's lead. Don't get distracted, we are only trolling Denmark.; Alright, engaging Twitter... now! Prepare for overreaction on my mark. 3... 2... Mark.; Hey, Mr. Garrison. Come on in, bud. Have a seat, you're not alone.; You, you're not gonna try and lynch me too?; No lynchings here, little cowboy. Take a seat. [Garrison takes the seat] You wanna share with us what you're goin' through?; [crying softly] It's all my fault. I just wanted to get rid of all the immigrants, you know? [takes out a napkin and blows his nose with it] I just- I thought we could fuck them all to death, and everyone started listening to me. Next thing I know I actually get the nomination from the Republicans!; It's not your fault, little guy.; It is my fault! I told people I could make the country great again, but I didn't have a plan!; Not your fault.; I got caught up in people cheerin' for me, bein' in the media every day. I, I led this entire election down the shitter.; You've gotta stop blaming yourself.; Well then, whose fault is it?!; Here, catch. [tosses a member berry at him]; Member Lando Calrissian? Member tauntauns? Member? Member feeling safe?; What the fuck is this?; That... is why millions of Americans want you to be President. But there's more...; It's started! [smiles. Gerald smiles back, then grins.]; Did they pick it up on Yahoo?; Don't know, but Google has it as the number one story.; Oh, shit! Go to, go to Huffington!; Millions of people took to the Internet last night after shocking claims were made about the Danish company LEGO and their ties to ISIS.; Oh yes! This is CNN front page right now.; It now appears the country of Denmark was the victim of a massive troll. The country is still reeling from the LEGO hoax story.; Tom, by the time the hoax was revealed the damage had already been done. Millions of people got on the anti-Denmark bandwagon, and when millions more came in to support Denmark, hundreds of millions more got on the anti-Denmark bandwagon.; We did it! We did it! [Kyle appears at the top of the stairs]; Oh, Kyle! Ahh, hey, I didn't think you'd be leaving yet.; I have a fundraiser at school.; Well, did you see what was all over the Internet? Everyone's ripping on LEGOs.; What?; Yeah, now the whole world is blowing up with Danish jokes. It's hilarious.; The Guardian has a bunch of stories up about how the Denmark government isn't responding to even interview requests.; Wow, fuck Denmark, huh Kyle? That's gotta be what just about everyone is thinking now. Fuck Denmark. [Dick grins]; Sir, public opinion of Denmark is-a very very shit.; All our social media pages are-a filled with million and millions of-a horrible comments.; And our crowd-funding sites are taken over too.; Everyone is making fun of us like we were goofballs.; How could-a this-a happen?; Because that's what trolls DO! I should have known that once they got wind of our little plan, they would start trolling us!; So then Denmark isn't funding ISIS?; Of course not!; But-a how do we prove that to the rest of-a the world?; We can't respond, it will only make the trolls stronger! Our only choice is to go offline; You mean we have to quit Twitter?; Everything, you ignoramus! The only way to stop the bleeding is for Denmark to get off social media! Pokkers Du Trold!; Hello. [a car rolls by] Buy a Danish to help stop trolling? How come nobody's stopping? Maybe this was a terrible idea.; It was a great idea. [spots another car driving by] Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark?; Heheh, fuck Denmark; [runs up with his boxes and throws then down] That's it! I am through with your stupid crap! Every house I've been to just rips on me and and says Denmark is stupid!; What?; [arriving] It's true. Denmark got trolled last night. They left social media.; Then, all of this was... for nothing.; I told you fellas! This is what you get for working with a bunch of stupid girls!; How is this our fault?! At least we actually did the work!; Oh yeah? You guys fucked up all the frosting!; You assholes overcooked them! [the kids begin to argue with each other]; Oh no! This was a terrible idea! [leaves the booth]; Heidi! [follows her]; I'm so stupid!; Don't say that.; Why did I even think I could bring the boys and girls together again?; Because you're smart and funny, that's why. It was a great idea, Heidi. [puts his hand on her shoulder] I think that somehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone even realizes.; Every great empire reaches a point where going backward can seem more appealing than forward. When the world is changing so fast it makes us yearn for the old ways, when life seemed simpler. But it doesn't mean those old ideas are good for us now. We have to face one hard reality as a country. [stands by an easel with a Star Wars poster on it] The new Star Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was. It may seem fun to go back and recycle the past we loved, but we end up with no sustenance.; I thought you were gonna explain why people want a guy like me to be President.; Well, that's important too, I guess, but, it's just a symptom of the same thing. See, when a civilization has become so big it starts to get lazy, then that's [removes the Star Wars poster to reveal a picture of a member berry orchard] when you get member berries. They're noting new. They date back all the way to the Roman Empire. [shows a painting of a woman giving her lover some member berries.] Once too many Romans ate the member berries there was no more growth. They rested on their laurels just eating and 'membering all the good stuff.; I think those are just grapes.; Thought so too till I zoomed in. [removes the painting to show a closeup of just the berries]; Member?; You see, we all wanna go back to when we were kids. Simple ideas like a big man to protect us, keep us safe. Instead of a fresh new Star Wars we want the old, just recycled and plopped in our tummies.; You almost make it sound like J.J. Abrams is responsible for this entire election.; Does this look familiar? [removes the closeup to show J.J. Abrams wearing a cap on which is written ""MAKE STAR WARS GREAT AGAIN.""]; [takes a good look at the picture, then stands up] Ohh Jeeez.; Sir! We got a message from overseas. You really should see it.; A message how? We're completely offline.; This was sent on VHS. Whoever sent it is-a completely offline too.; Put it on the screen. [a video pops up with Cartman and Heidi on it.]; People of Denmark, we know that you've been the victim of trolling. So have we. Maybe we can help. I'm not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... She's really smart and really funny.; Stop baby, no I'm not.; [whispers] You are, babe. Stop it.; Who the hell are these people?; Just listen.; [whispers] Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them.; I have an idea. I might be able to figure out the source of who trolled you last night.; Get everyone back inside. If this girl really is that smart and funny, we might have another shot here. [the other Dane goes away]"

[leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules!; What are you thinking about, Babe?; Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.; You're worried about him again, aren't you?

[tries looking behind him] What are you guys doing here?!; We came to celebrate!; Not everyday you troll a whole country.; [showed a case of John Adams beer] We brought some beer. Let's have a trolling party.; We did it!; I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world.; Yeah! Yeah!; You said it!; Thanks to us!; And I think on the next one, [raises his beer] we're only gonna get better.; No doubt about it.; Wh-what are you talking about ""next one""?; Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world?; We're like super-trolls who could change anything.; [leans to Dick] Can I talk to you for a second?; Why did you bring them here?!; What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt.; That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are!; But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election.; The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political!; Of course it's political!; No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?!; I remember being called a fag for no reason.; Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go.; Okay. [puts down his beer mug] Sure, Skankhunt. Whatever you say. [walks away]; Presidential election is only two weeks away.

You got a minute?; Oh, what do you want now?!; Just a second. Please, Kyle?; Hurry up!; Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby.; Ah! Dude, what the fuck?; Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.; I'm going to the bathroom!; Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset.; Why?; [walks away from the toilet] I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle?; [looks down] I have to stay with my group, Cartman.; [walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think.; Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little-- [sees FaceTime call from Dick] Ah. Oh no, not again! [accepts his call] Yes?; Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins.; I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting.; Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy.; I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed.; [sighs] Oh, alright. Look, [grabs his guitar] I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?; No!; [sings badly while strumming his guitar] Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the--; [ends the call] Bye! Jesus, what is wrong with people?! [drinks wine] Huh. [keeps typing] Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank.; [To Kyle.] This is gonna seem a little weird to you, okay?; What is?; Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was.; Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it.; Before I stopped searching, I learned something. [opens her door] Take a look.; What is all this?; To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it ""emoji analysis"". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away.; Wow, that's pretty smart.; She's funny too, Kyle.; After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult.; You mean like one of the teachers?; I think... it's one of the parents.; Are you sure?; I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match.; Emoji analysis, it's genius!; You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.; [sing] En junker red ved juletid 
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Omkring ham dalet sneen hvid 
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Han stred sig frem i regn og blæst Med et der segnede hans hest Tjing tjang lu Tjing tjang lu Tjing tjang tjing nutillej [stop singing]; [runs towards Bedrager] Sir, take a look at the [shows Bedrager analysis] statistical analysis. The servers are working.; So then we don't need any more funding?; [walks to Bedrager] No, sir. Using Heidi's emoji analysis, we have the final piece of the puzzle.; So far we have narrowed down the location of the troll attack on Denmark. [walks to map of the U.S. with state of Colorado highlighted] It is a location in the middle of the United States: a place they call ""Colorido"".; Colorido? That's a very goofy name.; We believe that very soon the servers will give us the place in Colorido that the troll originated.; [walks closer to map] Hmm hmm. Go on and hide in your cave, little troll. Soon, everyone will know where you live.; [stops putting in electricity] Damn it! [takes off flashlight] Nothing kills these things!; We have to keep trying. [walks to the jar and grabs it] Where did they go?; They're not in the jar? [turns around] That's it. Look, it's over.; No, I'll go find more. [leaves kitchen]; [follows Garrison] It's over! Don't you get it?! [walks closer to Garrison] Even if we've found a way to eradicate them now, we don't have time to implement it nation-wide.; Then how do we stop them from getting me elected President?; [walks away from Garrison] There's no other choice, Mr. Garrison. [stops walking] The American people have to be made to understand what's going on here. [turns around] You're gonna have to talk to them.; [raises his hands near his head] No, no! I am done giving political speeches: I've tried being dirty, I tried being vulgar. [spreads his arm a little] Nothing matters!; [walks closer to Garrison] For the first time ever, [stops walking] you're gonna have to speak from the heart: not make it about you.; Well that's just impossible.; You know what these things are capable of. Even if you lose the election, another one like you is gonna rise up and take your place. J.J. Abrams is seeing to that.; [lays his hand on his face] Don't you get it, Randy? I'm not a politician. I never was.; All I know is that for the future of our country, you're gonna have to give one last speech: the speech that everyone needs to hear, a speech where you finally just talk like a normal human being.; Oooh geeeeez!; Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said Heidi wasn't funny, that was pretty lame, man.; She wasn't being funny.; Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have this hangup against women?!; I don't!; You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter! [turns to leave]; Cartman, [leaves his chair] I did some research on the Danish Web site you've been helping out. You do realize that once TrollTrace is online, anybody can use it on anyone, right?; Yeah, to catch trolls.; So somebody, like Heidi, could use it to see your entire Internet history. Everything you ever said and did on the Internet, even before you were together.; [a look of fear crosses his face] Well, Heidi doesn't actually use the Internet. We've sworn off that stuff, so it's kewl.; Right, but somebody, like me, could look up your entire Internet history, print it out, and give it to Heidi. I would imagine there's some things you've done or said on the Internet you wouldn't want Heidi to know about.; [thinks for a moment] ...Uh oh. [the recent past flashes through his mind, stopping off at the moment he saw Heidi's vagina in his room with the lights out, then moving on to the day he saw Ghostbusters]; Did you like the movie, hon?; No, it sucked! I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now. [whips out his phone and types] ""Dude, don't bother with new Ghostbusters. Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it."" [puts the phone away] Can we get ice cream now? I wanna get the taste of ass out of my mouth. [fast forward to the present]; How can they make what I said on the Internet available to the public? That's bullshit!; It's available to everyone, stupid!; I gotta go! [runs out]; Heehee, hurry! Come on, we have to hurry! Let's go.; [rolls away from toaster] This way, this way! We have to go this way, 'member?; [bounces away from toaster] Oh, I 'member!; [rolls away from toaster] Come on, we have to hurry! [rolls while Berry 1 bounces]; [bounces away from toaster] 'Member Jabba the Hut? [bounces while following the others]; Yeah! Come on Tubbs, you have to keep up! 'Member?! [rolls while following the others]; [bounces while ] Hehe, sorry. I 'member.; Okay, almost there.; [stops] 'Member the Battle of Endor?; Shh.; [talks softer] 'Member the Battle of Endor?; [stops] Oh I 'member. [berries keep on moving].; Hehehe. Are we almost there?; Shh.; Come on, 'member?; Oh I 'member!; I miss my friend.; Oh you got to be--Are you joking?!; I don't know how things got derailed but, I-I'm sorry if I made you upset. I want to be buddies again.; Buddies like when? When were we buddies?; Come on, let's just have a couple of beers and do some trolling.; I don't have time for you! I'm sorry, dude, but I have a life. I have a wife, and kids, [raises his arms] and shit to do!; Why are you mad at me'?; Because you won't go away and let me just have fun!; I refuse to believe that Skankhunt is that shallow.; [turns to his side] Oh here we go!; When you Photoshopped penises in Kesha survivors' mouths, it's not just to make people laugh.; [faces Dick] Yes it is!; If someone Photoshopped a dick in your wife's mouth, would you just think it was funny?; You mean my [shows his phone to Dick with image of Sheila Photoshopped] fucking screensaver.; It's true. You're just an asshole. I thought you were the ultimate rebel. I actually looked up to you and you're nothing but a super... dick.; And what are [points at Dick] you, Dildo Shwaggins? Huh? You think you're a fucking political activist hauled up in your shitty little midget condo. You're nothing but a pissed off little giant, lashing out at everyone because you can't get laid!; At least I have a reason to be angry. What do you have, that it's funny? Hurting people is just worth the laughs?; Stop trolling me.; One day you're gonna wake up and realize that you don't have anyone either.; Stop fucking trolling me. [shuts the front door]; Den jomfru sad i høje torn 
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Og vendte ham som til forn Tjing tjang tjing nutillej; We have it! We think we have it! [stops walking] The emoji analysis worked. We've found the IP address of the troll that trolled us.; [turns around] Triangulate the servers.; [servers triangulated an area on North Colorado]; Focus everything on that area. It's time to see what these puppies can do.; Once again, if you live in the city of Fort Collins, there is a chance that all your emails and your entire Internet history has been made accessible to the public.; [checks his neighbor who is seen running out of the house screaming]; [exits the house] Who the fuck are these emails to, and what the, what the fuck is MarriedButHorny.com?! [throws the Mac at her husband]; [sees his phone and picks it up with caution] Hello?; I know where you live now you son-a bitch.; [throws his phone on his desk and runs away to his car where he drives]; I've been hacked! Help me I've been hacked!; They'll never forgive me! [jumps down from a high building]; [quickly presses the brake pedal, but crashes to the car in front of him. He leaves his car behind]; [gets out of her car] They know everything I said about them! The club knows--; [pushes the woman] Get away from me! [runs away, but then gets stopped]; Hello MLKKK! You called my daughter ""R2-D2"". You know how long I waited this day, you son-a bitch! [throws a gasoline and lights a match on MLKKK, causing him to burn in pain]; Is he burning, Pa?!; He's burning bright, little girl.; [sings] It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa Gonna take some time to do the things...; 'Member which way we're going?; I 'member.; Hey hey, 'member the Ewok village?; Oh I 'member!; I 'member that!; Oh sure, I 'member!; 'Member 'member!; [a knocking sound is heard from the trunk]; Oh shit, hang on. [pulls the car over and stops the song]; [the berries show left the car and opened the trunk to reveal a hostage berry]; Hey you, shut the fuck up!; Yeah, we're gonna kill you, 'member?; Oh, I 'member. [trunk gets shut]; It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do; Oh, 'member this song?; Sure, I 'member.; I love this song, it was fanta'tic, 'member?; Oh I 'member. Oh I love it when you 'member! 'Member! 'Member?; Complete panic and mass-hysteria tonight as the City of Fort Collins has been hacked.; Oh my god. Oh my god, they've done it.; The Danish are taking complete credit for the cyber-attack, blaming its successfully exposed and notorious troll. [MLKKK's picture and identity is shown] The man has been identified as the Internet troll MLKKK, and was burned alive by one of his apparent victims.; Ah!; The Danish claimed this was only a beta-test and soon the servers will be available worldwide. [turns his head to his left] Wait, so like they'll be releasing everyone's Internet history? Uh, I gotta go. [runs away]; No! No no no no no! [FaceTimes Dick] Dildo, they done it! The Danish figured out how to hack everyone's Internet history!; [ends the call]; Ahhh!; Not kewl! Not kewl! [holds onto a rock and sees someone caught in the storm, flying away] Not kewl! [tries to walk to the station]; [holds onto a station] Wait!; Have fun! [gets blown away by storm]; [roler coaster gets damaged]; It's all falling apart! Weak!; What is it, Eric? What's wrong?; I-I, I don't know.; Come on. We don't keep secrets, remember?; It's just hard.; You said you wanted to be perfectly honest with me, always.; And I do. [breathes heavily] This one time, [wipes his nose] I think it was over the summer I went to see the new Ghostbusters movie.; Yeah.; And, and during the movie I was like ""Wait, where is my phone?"" and I couldn't find it; and then Jimmy said ""Ha ha ha, screw you, Cartman,"" and he was holding my phone and he ran off with it and said, ""I gonna send a bunch of texts and emails from your phone so that everyone thinks it's from you,""; and I was like ""No, that's not cool!"" and he said ""Yeah,"" and he said a bunch of mean stuff before I went to go get him and I took my phone back; and I'm just worried th-that people look at my Internet history, they're gonna think all that stuff came from me!; Well I'm glad you told me, 'cause now I know.; So you totally believe me?; Of course. [Cartman and her touch hands] You've never given me a reason not to believe you, babe.; [sees Mars restored] Kewl! [leaps]; You have no reason to worry. People will know it wasn't you. With emoji analysis, everyone will be able to tell exactly where any comments came from.; [holds onto a rock, noticing a severe dust storm] Ugh! No, [lets go of the rock] nooo!; My fellow Americans, we live in an un-presented time of uncertainty. I want to speak to you human-to-human because with God's grace, this will be the last time you ever hear from me. When I started this campaign I was saying a lot of shit because I was angry, [Gerald is seen in a bar, worried] and then I turned that anger into pushing buttons by more and more outrageous. Slowly, people started paying attention to me and I guess it made me feel powerful. Well now the chickens have come home to roost. [Kyle, Ike, and Sheila are seen having dinner in their home] Sooner or later, we all get exposed. [Gerald sees his family having dinner] We're all held accountable for what we say, what we do. [Garrison is seen again] There is only one thing that matters now. On November eighth, you must vote against me, and show the world that you didn't think the new Star Wars was all that good. When you're in that voting booth, remember that every vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote that shows the world we agree that The Force Awakens was more like a happy day reunion's special than a movie. The choice is yours, America. Please make the right one.; The Danish claim they will soon have the ablity to publish anyone's Internet history. We have to act fast, Mrs. Sandwich.; I'll have you treat me with more respect. Haven't you seen the polls? It's president elects Sandwich.; We may not want to get too far ahead ourselves. [takes out a file of Skankhunt42 from envelope] TrollTrace must be stopped. [gives file to Clinton]; Who is Skankhunt42?; We believe he's the only one who can save you now.; Here we are. We made it.; We did?; Yeah, we have to go with Plan B, 'member?; Ooh, I 'member.; [talks to Hostage Berry] Sorry asshole, end of the line for you.; That's okay, I 'member. [gets pushed into a drink]; [grabs the drink and brings it to a table] Here you are, ma'am, gin and tonic.; [grabs drink] Thanks.; Should be an interesting election this year, huh?; [takes a sip] Buckle up, buckaroos."

Looks like America has voted for a change of pace. The world is in a bit of a shock, uh... Is this? We're, we're for sure this is for real, right?; What have you done?! You maniacs! [a man seated near the entrance pulls a gun out his back pocket and shoots himself in the head, falling off the chair.]; We uh... I guess we're going live to the acceptance speech now? Uhh okay, here we go.; [with Caitlyn beside him] The people have spoken. Just as J.J. Abrams did with Star Wars, I will make this country great again.; This isn't how it was supposed to happen.; All my efforts this past week have paid off. And now, let's begin... fucking them all to death!; Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?; What do you want?!; [walks in] Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny?; Well I don't know, Eric.; I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you ""Ghostbusters sucked balls"" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person.; NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor!; A traitor?; Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?!; Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!; Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now!; Please do not call her that, Butters. I really like her.; Oh God, listen to you! [mimics his last sentence] ""Please don't call her that I really like her."" You've changed, Eric! You've really changed! Now get the fuck out of my house! [Cartman is taken back, but closes his mouth and walks out the door. Butters slams it closed behind him]; A historic election, and all the votes are in. Except of course in the city of Fort Collins, Colorado. It's been several days now since Fort Collins was hacked. Everyone's e-mails and Internet history became accessible to the public after being targeted by the Danish Trolltrace program. According to our eye in the sky, their votes will not be tallied anytime soon.; It's complete bedlam inside the city limits, Chris. [traffic accidents at every intersection, a broken fire hydrant spewing a geyser of water, three giraffes running through the streets...] Since the city was hacked there have been murder, suicide, and complete lack of civility. We also understand that nearly everyone within Fort Collins who was married is now divorced. Back to you, Tom.; This barricade behind me was put up not only to make sure nobody goes into Fort Collins, but also to make sure nobody gets out, since there's no telling whose Internet histories they've seen; [at the top of the barricade] Please! [Tom glances at him and the camera zooms in] My wife is so pissed at me! [a bullet strikes him from the air and he falls to his death several stories down.] Guh!; [faces the camera] The defiant Danish company is still declaring Trolltrace a success, and claims that it will be available worldwide at any moment.; Oh God... [he looks up at the sky and sees the helicopter] Oh God! [he goes outside for a better look. Two government vehicles pull up right away and agents pour out of them]; We have him. The subject is home. [Gerald looks around, then runs inside and closes the door]; Dad, what the?; What's goin' on, Dad? [Sheila comes out of the kitchen]; [runs up to her] They're coming for me, Sheila! They know everything!; About what??; Everything I did online! It's over!; Sir, if you'll come with us?; We need to speak with you?; [shields him] You people really have nothing better to do?! What he did online is his business! Or maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the one that likes being peed on and I sucked him into it. Did you know that urine is 100% sterile?! How dare you burst into our home! [a shot of Ike and Kyle looking confused]; Sheila!; Urologia has been around since the time of the Greeks!; Sir. Please come with us now. [Gerald walks towards them]; Gerald, you don't have to listen to them.; I'm sorry, Sheila. Please know that I love you so much. Goodbye Kyle, Ike. [all three look on helplessly]; I can't believe it, babe. I really didn't think things would end up like this.; Yeah. Neither did I.; I just... feel so disconnected from the world, you know? I really thought this was gonna be the moment that proved girls could do anything, like you always say.; You can't stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong.; I'm just glad I have you. At least I know you believe girls are smart.; You are smart, Heidi.; And funny too, right? You're always saying how people need to get over that girls are funny.; [getting emotional] You're funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I seriously lose my shit.; Hey, are you okay? This election really got to you too, huh?; Yes, Heidi. For the first time I'm really scared for the future.; Me too, babe. [scoots in and rests her head on his shoulder] Me too.; Where are you taking me? [the agents take him down the riverbank to the riverbed] Wait! Please, there's been a mistake! Someone set me up! I'm not Skankhunt42! [the agents take him to a shadowy figure under the bridge] Dildo?; [comes out of the shadows] Hello. Mr. Cunt.; Turd Sandwich... I don't understand.; Things... have not turned out the way they were supposed to. This election was stolen. And while this government is still in power, we have to prove it. We've come to ask for your help.; My help?; Leave us. [the agents leave and head up the riverbank] As I understand, there's quite a lot you've done online you don't wanna have come out. But I also understand you weren't trying to get a woman to kill herself. You were just being funny.; Exactly!; The Trolltrace program is the most sophisticated of its kind. The government has only a few short weeks to try and use that technology to stop the President-elect from taking office.; What do you want me to do?; You've proven one thing: that you have the ability to pretend to be someone you're not. We wanna send someone into Denmark undercover and steal their technology.; You mean like... like James Bond? [looking hopeful]; Totally like James Bond. You and I need each other, Skank. What do you say?; Garrison! Garrison, what the fuck have you done?! [Caitlyn answers the door] Where is he?!; He's resting. He's had a busy week.; [goes inside] Yeah I'll say he has! [sees him on the sofa and walks up to him] Do you have any idea what you've done to our country?!; Yeah. Fuck them all.; You admitted you didn't know how to run a country! You agree people were supporting you just because they like the new Star Wars, and you begged me to help you lose!; I changed my mind. The new Star Wars was actually really good.; No it wasn't!! Something else has to have happened!!; Maybe some people enjoy nostalgia and going back to what feels comfortable.; There's nothing great about rehashing all the old Star Wars moments into a new- [Caitlyn vomits out a gusher of member berry juice.] Ah! Aaah! Aaaaaah! [bits of member berries are on Randy's face] Aaah. [member berry voices are heard] I, I suppose... I suppose I can watch it one more time. Give it another chance.; [hands him a dossier] You're flying to Denmark under the guise of being a foreign ambassador. The Danish think you want to help them. Here's your fake passport and here are your nifty camera glasses. [the lead agent hands those over to Gerald]; Wow...; Once inside the Trolltrace building, you will plant this. [the fourth agent walks forward with a briefcase] Looks like an ordinary briefcase, but at exactly 9:30 Danish standard time. the case will open, detonating an EMP device that will take out their entire facility.; It'll fry all their equipment, servers, and backup computers. After it detonates we'll be on the roof to pick you up.; [smiles] And then everything can go back to normal.; One last thing: to pass yourself off as the ambassador, you have to pretend to be from the Turkish Islands. Are you any good at... changing your voice?; That depends. Are you asking me? Or are you asking... [does his first impersonation] me, Andy the drunk sheriff? *hic* [next impersonation] Or me, the old Irish dart player? [third impersonation - Peter Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [fourth impersonation - Stewie Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [fifth impersonation - Chris Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [The lead agent and Agent 2 give him thumbs up]; Hi Ike, it's Daddy. Everything OK there? [Ike look around] Listen, buddy, you remember how we talked about trolling and just between us guys we agreed it was pretty funny? [Kyle walks by Ike's room, hears Gerald's voice and stops to look inside] Well it turns out that even the-; Dad! [runs into Ike's room] Where are you?; Oh, hey Kyle.; Dad, what's going on? Mom is freaking out.; Tell your mom everything's fine, okay? I'm helping out the government. It's top-secret stuff, but everything's finally gonna be okay.; No, Dad, I need you back home. Please, I-I'm so confused right now.; Kyle, you've gotta lighten the fuck up, buddy. Every day with you it's ""Dad, I feel guilty about this. Dad, I'm so confused about that."" You're a kid. You're supposed to just laugh and make fun of shit. [smiles] Stop being such a pussy, okay pal? Fuck. [hangs up, leaving Kyle a bit stunned]; Daddy called you a pussy.; Alright everyone, listen up. I know that many of us were shocked to the core with last night's election. But we cannot allow our school to be any further divided. It is time to try and start the healing process, and so here, to try and help us heal, is Bill Clinton. [claps. He's the only one to do so. Bill Clinton steps out from behind the screen]; Hi kids. I'm Bill Clinton, and I was almost the first gentleman in America. Thank you. Even though we might have lost the election, it doesn't mean that my work to be a gentleman is goin' to stop. I'm gonna ask all you boys to agree to join Bill Clinton's Gentleman Club. [its logo shows up on screen] But I can't do it alone. Sometimes, I wish there were two of me. Oh wait, there are. Oh Bill!; Yes, Bill?; Come on out here.; Hello, boys and girls.; I'm Bill; And I'm Bill; And together we're Bill and Bill 
Two birds of a feather comin' to your school Gonna show you all about what gentlemen do. When you're not quite sure how you feel Ask Bill and Bill.; Say, Bill?; Yes, Bill?; Would you like to join my gentlemen's club?; You know I would, Bill.; Heidi? Heidi!; Hey babe. What's the matter?; Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's really important.; Okay.; Heidi, we... have to get to Mars.; I know, babe. You've talked about how humankind needs to get to Mars for a few weeks now.; No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now. [walks around a bit] I've seen what's gonna happen when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it's going to be very bad. Humankind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the people who go to Mars, where there's no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody said or did on the Internet, ever.; Babe, there's no way to get to Mars right now.; Yes. [walks up to hold her hand] Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know that I'm doing this to save... us.; I trust you with everything I have.; That's kewl.; Your name, please?; Miller. Von Miller. [adjusts his cuff links] I'm the ambassador of technology from the Turkish Islands.; Oh yes of course, Ambassador Miller. You're here to support our country's-a Trolltrace program, yes?; That's right.; Your escort is-a right over there. [points to her left. Dane 5 waits at the exit holding a welcome sign up: ""AMBASSADOR VON MILLER""]; Nice little country you have here. Really clean.; Yes, ambassador. Denmark is ranked the nicest place to live in all the world almost every year. [the car stops at the Trolltrace entrance and the occupants step out] This is it, ambassador. All of Trolltrace is housed in this building.; Mhm. [takes a picture. They go inside and Gerald looks around the lobby] Wow, this is really impressive. [takes a few more pictures]; [appears] Thank you for coming. [Gerald turns around] Welcome to Trolltrace. I cannot tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit, [somewhat ominously] Ambassador Von Miller. We have so much to talk about. Won't you join me upstairs for frikadellers and leverpostejs?; I can't imagine how you're feeling right now. I know that the election didn't go the way you'd hoped. What I want to say is, I'm sorry. [Wendy is shown facing him across the table] I know that girls have gone through a lot lately, and I just want you to know that... I'm here for you.; Okay, okay, that's good, but now, make sure she knows how you're gonna change.; I am gonna change. I, I am.; Whether she takes you back or not.; Yeah well, but I, but I want her to take me back.; [pops into view as he leans back on his chair] Yeah, but if you're just changin' to get her back, then you're bein' selfish again.; Okay, look. The bottom line is, you still have to have faith... in boys, because... because I miss you, Wendy. [some knocking nearby. Stan and Wendy look in the direction of the knocking]; Traitor! [Stan, Wendy, and Bill Clinton see him outside with four other boys - Craig, Clyde, Tweek, and Francis] Fuck you, Stan! You're a traitor! [drops his pants to show his wiener and puts his fist high up in the air]; Go away Butters! [Cosby leans back to see what's going on]; Who's that?; How dare you be ashamed of who you are?! [steps forward and presses his wiener onto the window]; Oh, he's pressin' pickle!; Enjoying the frikadellers?; Oh. Yes, they're nice.; And the leverpostejs are seasoned to your liking?; Ah, I wouldn't know. Ha, haha.; You keep-a checking your watch, Ambassador Von Miller. Are you late for something?; No, no I, I-I'm just anxious to get a look at your servers. They must be quite impressive.; Yes. Well a database that can identify everybody's Internet activity is-a very complex. I'm so pleased you want to help us rid the world of-a trolls. Do you happen to recognize... [clicks on a remote controller and a black and white picture of Freja Ollegard appears onscreen] this woman?; Ahhh... no.; Her name was-a Freja Ollegard. She was Denmark's-a national treasure. [pours himself some Gold Top wine] She had an amazing breast-cancer awareness website, and some... troll... decided to Photoshop-a wieners in her mouth. [Gerald stifles a laugh by putting a napkin over his mouth]; Oh, wow. That's terrible.; Her final straw was when she was trolled on a live TV show. [pours some more wine into a second glass] When the troll posted comments about-a breast cancer with-a fake doctors' names. Would you like to know what the doctors' names were? The first one was a Dr. Boobsoff. Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff. [Gerald stifles a second laugh] Then I believe there was a Dr. Juerdior Titsgo. [Gerald stifles a third laugh] But probably most insensitive of all was when the troll said he was Dr. Ipples. Dr. Now I'm Only-n Ipples. [Gerald stifles a fourth laugh, but it's getting harder and harder to do so. Lennart notices and gets in his face] Are you alright, Von Miller?!; I'm fine. I... I think the frikadellers gave me a little heartburn. Ah, if you wouldn't mind, could I see the servers now?; It would be my pleasure.; Hello, I'm Bill Clinton, and I was almost the First Gentleman in America.; Oh my gosh! Honey, it's the nearly-Gentleman!; May I come into your lovely home?; Well of course, that's very gentlemanly of you. [Clinton enters]; Oh my goodness, it's him. Hello, sir.; Hello, ma'am. I wasn't expecting someone so stunning. [takes her right hand and kisses it] I'm so sorry for the intrusion, but I was wondering if I could speak with your son.; Oh. Well, I'm afraid Butters is grounded for pressing pickle at the nail salon again.; Stephen, this is a guest, a gentleman.; Uh but, but of course we'll make an exception. [takes Clinton upstairs and to Butters' door] Butters has been grounded quite a lot lately. Don't know what's gotten into him. [unlocks the seven locks and latches used to keep Butters in his room]; Well, maybe I can help.; That'd be great. No matter how hard we ground him, he remains defiant. [finally opens the bedroom door. Butters is standing on his bed looking out the window, with his wiener out] Butters, stop smooshing snake! The gentleman is here to speak with you.; [over his shoulder] What?; Hello, young man. Come on, sit down. Let's talk.; Well, I don't know about you guys, but I sure am excited. America is going to be great again. Aren't you excited, gang?; No I'm not excited! It sucks, Dad! This country is gonna suck for four years!; Aww, come on, Shelly. We've learned that women can be anything. Except for President.; Randy! You just spent the last month convincing me that the only reason people wanted to go back was because of a childish nostalgia they all had for the new Star Wars!; Have you really watched it, Sharon? It has more to offer than just nostalgia. Let's all watch it again tonight.; What?! I don't wanna watch Star Wars any more than I- [Randy vomits member berry juice on her]; Dad, what the hell is wrong with y- [Randy vomits member berry juice on her]; Please, ambassador, explore the servers at your leisure. Let us know if you have any questions.; Thank you. [the Danes leave, and Gerald goes into spy mode, entering the vault and locking it. He takes pictures every few steps and passes by Dick unaware]; You can stop being an idiot now.; [notices him] What the-?

Hillary Clinton says I was the only one capable of-; Of being smart and funny enough to pull it off. Yeah, that's what she told all of us.; All of us? Who? [Dick looks to his left and Gerald follows his gaze. The other trolls in their group are there with their own briefcases]; Hey Skankhunt.; What the hell is going on?; Don't you get it? The government made some kind of deal with the Danish. They handed us over so they wouldn't go forward with their Trolltrace program. They wanted the troll who killed Freja Ollegard and his associates. We got sold out because of you!; No! [runs to the vault door] No, you've got to let me out of here! I'm not one of them! [pounds on the door in vain. The briefcases begin to beep]; [notices] Hey look, it's 9:30. The briefcases are about to go off. [When the briefcases pop open, they prepare to die, but they get rickrolled instead.]; What do you think you're gonna achieve, young man? Do you really think all this pickle-pressing is gonna get you anywhere?; Well, I'm just angry, Mr. Gentleman. I'm tired of girls saying boys need to change. Somebody has to stand up for our rights!; What happened, son? Did a girl break your heart?; [suddenly tears up] No.; I know. I know how hard they can be. But... somethin's about to happen that you aren't aware of. [stands up and walks off a bit] You see, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And trust me, my wife is a crazy bitch. She and all the other women in the world are about to get payback. And we are all completely fucked. It's my fault, really. I've done things my whole life that gradually broke her spirit. And now that she's lost everything, let me assure you: she is piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissed. [walks back to the bed and sits down] Now, our only chance is to keep our heads low and act like we're changed men. Because, we're very close to the end.; The end? Of what?; Women are sick of our shit, son. And soon, they're gonna know everything we've said and done online. And unless we start kissin' their asses, we're all gonna be put in a big chamber underground and milked for our semen.; Eric, we're so far from home.; We aren't gonna see home again, babe. We're gonna make it. There's no turning back.; You really think there's hope?; Yes. I do. [before them is SpaceX]"

This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.; ...Okay.; We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible.

Take a number and join the others.; What others?; [Cartman, Heidi, and the secretary turn their heads see a bunch of other people waiting, including Cher singing]; [garbled and auto-tuned] If I could turn back time...; What the fuck, dude?!; Lot of people want to leave the planet right now.; Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!; [garbled and auto-tuned] Do you believe in leaving the world, oh...; God [knocks down papers] dammit!

[makes stank face] Are you really sorry? [makes different stank face] Because you see PC Principal, you helped create me. You insisted that I was a bigot, that I was an intolerant relic left over from another time. But now, I'm your president.

When all the skin on your penis is drying out from working so hard to get elected there's only one thing that can fix it, isn't there? Saliva, from a good friend who once doubted you.

Of course, you'll have to tell them why you're here.; What are you gonna do with us?; We're going to use you to set the world on fire. When the servers go online, there will be chaos, panic, and war. And from the ashes, a new world will rise: a world where everyone is happy, and singing, and has no secrets, [yells] like Denmark!

You know if they have anything at this store for a dry dick? Huh? No? You guys can't think of anything? Oh, I know. What about [points to] Eduardo Hernandez? I believe it was Eduardo who told me I couldn't double-bag my groceries, even though he's from fucking Guatemala. Well, what do you think now, Eduardo? You wanna double-bag somethin' else? [his phone rings, and he pulls out out of his back pocket to answer it] This is the President.; Sir, we need you at the Pentagon. It's a matter of national security.; Oh, really?

Get it?! It's called ""using your brain"", fatso!; So they'll blame your kid?; Nobody cares if a kid trolls! What are they gonna do, get a slap on the wrist?; [stands up] Didn't you hear what that guy said? They're gonna set countries against each other! We have way bigger problems!; You don't know my fucking wife! [faces the phone] Ike, you got it? Great, pal! Okay, now I need you to go to the comment section, okay, and type in ""You should all get raped by gorillas"". You got that pal? Ike, ""You should all get raped by gorillas""! Come on, we have a lot of work to do here!; Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long.; You really think this is what we should do, babe? I gonna miss everyone.; I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.; Hey, Eric! [seen right near Cartman]; [speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here?; Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number.; Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars.; [shows complete fear] No, you don't understand.

I just caught Ike trolling Mrs. Herrera!; Are you serious?; Yes! The school troll is our son, Gerald! You should see all the things he's posted on his computer!; God dang it! Let me talk to him right now!; [hands her phone to Ike]; Hello?; Hey Ike, just stay calm and act like I'm yelling at you, okay pal? Okay, give it a few seconds, wait. Good. Okay, now--now say ""I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside"".; No!; Ike, you have to listen to me. On your mother's life, this is a matter of national security!

I need you to type ""How'd you like a donkey dick?"".; [salutes] Welcome to the Pentagon, sir. I've been ordered to show you around. [turns around] This way, please.; [follows the general] So I can do whatever the fuck I want in here now, right?; Yes, sir. Here are all [gives Garrison a folder of classified information] our military secrets and all classified information.; [takes folder] Okay, good.; [stops everyone by the Drone Program entrance] This is the Drone Program. In there you can kill anyone on Earth remotely. Here's the keys. [gives keys to Garrison]; Thanks!; [everyone continues walking]; In here is satellite surveillance where you can monitor anyone's conversation live.; Oh that will come in handy.; Extreme interrogation [stops everyone] room in case you find interrogation necessary.; Oh hell yeah, it's necessary. Let's do it.; [gives Garrison a briefcase] And here of course is the famous ""football"", where you could order a nuclear attack in four minutes. [walks away]; Love me some football. [follows the general]; [stops everyone by the Diplomatic Strategy entrance] And finally, in here, is the diplomatic strategy and negotiating room. [opens the doors, having everyone enter the room]; Well, jeez, this doesn't look very fun.; Thank God you're here sir. We need your guidance.; Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too.; Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance.; No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect.; Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?; Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton?; Oh yeah, that movie was funny.; Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great.; Wow, I guess you're right.; Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!; Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time.; [looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing.; What, babe?; Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?; [giggles] Why do you want me telling you jokes all the time?; Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious.; Well, did I tell you the one about the skeleton and the skunk?; [laughs] That's already funny! [Cartman gets frustrated and makes a fist with his left hand]; All around the world, countries are mobilizing armies and preparing defensive countermeasures.; Why? What the hell happened?; This is everything you need to know about the TROLL TRACE program.; What's TROLL TRACE?; A plan by the Danish to release the full internet histories of everyone on Earth.; The previous administration tried to work with the Danish by handing over several trolls, but the plan didn't work.; The entire world has become very uncertain and unstable.; We think we should order all navy vessels to the Bering Sea.; For what?; Because when the Chinese are able to see all our e-mails and online activity, we believe they will most likely attack us. Also, there are ground troops mobilizing in Paris because the French believe when we see all their e-mails, we will most likely attack them.; Mr. President, sir! The Russians are asking what we intend to do about the Danish.; Well, why are you asking me?; Please, sir, we have very little time before this escalates beyond our control.; ????????? ?????, ??????? ??????????, ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???????? ?????????

[The group, which includes Cher, walks in, and the door slams shut behind them]; Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tour. I'm Elon Musk. Are we gonna have some fun today?; Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.; And getting anywhere takes ingenuity. Oh, Mrs. Door? Would you mind... opening, please?; [interactive doors] Yes, Elon. [the doors rattle, but don't open. Elon turns and opens them manually. A chime plays as the doors open, and Elon leads the group onto the factory floor]; The only way for humankind to survive is with imagination and technology. Cars that run on electricity. Solar panels that replace roof shingles. Even food that changes form. You see this? It's a pizza, only four inches long. And yet, when heated, it expands to make enough pizza to feed a hundred people. I call it the pizza... pocket.; [whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets.; Who would like to see the Hyperloop? A new mode of travel that can take you from here to Dubai in nine minutes.; Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?; Sir, India is moving aircraft carriers into the Gulf of Mexico.; Well why would we care about Mexicans?!; [in winter fatigues] Sir, a message from Saudi Arabia. They say they pinky-promise not to look up our Internet history if we pinky-promise not to look up theirs.; Well what does that even mean?!; [in winter fatigues] Still waiting on if we should send troops into Japan, sir.; I don't know, jeez!; Sir, it's the UK Secretary of Foreign Affairs calling from London. He says they have advice for you.; What?; Yes, hello? Things aren't looking good here. We just want to say, whatever you do, don't eat the membberries.; [overhearing] Don't eat the membberries. They are bad.; Memberries?; I'm afraid everyone here who ate the memberries wanted to go back in the past, you see. Hasn't worked out too well for us.; We shouldn't have ate the memberries!; The memberries cloud your judgement. They get inside your head, you see.; Get inside your head... Wait a minute... Nobody gets in my head, you limey bitch! Are you insulting me?! Stop wasting my time! 'Cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours suckin' my dick!! [slams the phone down on the receiver]; What'd he say?; I believe they've eaten the memberries.; Ooh, dear!; Ooh, dear!; Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets. They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on Earth for reuse. [the group moves back to the lobby] Well, I certainly wanna thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group. Give yourselves a round of applause.; Huh?; Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?; Mars? We're still about ten years away from going to Mars. Maybe eight.; Awwww.; No, no nonono, we have to go now!; Well I'm sorry, but it's a bit more complicated than a pizza pocket. Going to Mars is gonna take a lot of very smart people working very hard for a very long time. Now, if you don't mind, I have hundreds of more tours to do. [turns to exit the lobby]; Mr. Musk, wait! [Musk turns around] Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart, and really funny. [Cartman flashes an angry face at Butters]; Like... how funny?; Out of the way, 'member?; You'd better 'member if you know what's good for youse! [the car moves through the crowd, down the corridors and into the Oval Office]; Hey look, it's them. 'Member? Sure, I 'member. [the mobster berries get out of the car]; Ey, youse did good. Who's in charge, 'member?; We decided he's in charge.; No, we said I'm in charge, 'member?; No wait, I 'member. We all said he's in charge. [leans to the left]; Oh yeah, I 'member.; Wrong.

People wanna 'member? They're gonna 'member.; Ike? [Ike looks back at Kyle, then puts his head on the wall again] What are you doing?; Don't talk to him! He is in big trouble!; Well what'd he do?; It's him, Kyle! Your brother is the internet troll who's caused all this pain in our community!; What?; It was him all along. Now we have to figure out what to tell people when they learn this ugliness came from our family. [walks back into the kitchen]; You made people quit Twitter? You started a war between boys and girls? You...?; I call it ""Emoji Analysis"". It isn't a student, it's an adult.; This ugliness came from our family!; I think it's one of the parents.; You're suppose to just laugh and make fun of shit.; Daddy called you a pussy.; [stops thinking back] Oh my God. Oh my God! Ike, come on! [grabs Ike's hand and rushes out the front door with him. Sheila hears the front door open and looks around for her boys. She reaches the open front door]; Kyle? Ike?!

You don't want to be like Kyle, do you?; [goes in front of the computer] Hi dad.; [gets shocked] Hey, buddy! Everything good there?; It was you, this whole time. You're the troll that caused all of this trouble.; No, it was your brother. I don't know what's wrong with him, Kyle. He needs counseling...; Heidi Turner did an emoji analysis. It was an adult. It was you.; [starts talking right before Kyle finished] Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Okay, keep your voice down.; [talks softly] Why dad? Why did you do this?; Because it's fucking funny, Kyle. It's called having a sense of humor, and laughing. You should fucking try it once in a while!; Putting a penis in the mouth of a mom who has cancer is funny?!; Because it's so not funny, God! Pushing people's buttons to get a reaction can actually be very good for society, Kyle. Listen to me, the Danish are fucking crazy. You have to get people to stop them.; How?!; Go get people riled up. Call the President. I don't know. When you push people's buttons, they go and push other people's buttons. Now get out there and... [ends call]; [enters Ike's room and yells] Kyle, Ike! What the hell is this?! What did I say?! Get off of that computer riiight nooooow!; [puts his head down]; Uh everyone, please listen! We don't have any rockets going to Mars! Yo-you're not listening! We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet. We're working as hard as we can. There's a little girl working on the people right now and apparently she's incredibly smart and funny.; [walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe?; [grabs mug] Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.; Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.; Girls rule, women are funny, get over it.; [does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.; [sighs]; Uh excuse me. Sorry, can we have a word please?; [yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk]; This doesn't seem like it's gonna work out and we're rather busy.; Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth.; I haven't really heard her say anything funny.; Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself.; [sits on chair, watching the conversation] He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot.; [faces Butters with a mad face]; Here they come.; [Dane 2 opens the door as Bedrager, Dane 1, Dane 4, and him enter. The trolls stand up]; Oh thank god. There's been a mistake, okay?! I'm not one of [points at the other trolls] them. My son is Skankhunt42. Go online and see, he's still doing it!; [points a gun at the trolls]; All of you, remove your clothes.; What are you gonna do with us?; Remove your clothes now!; [the trolls strip themselves naked]; [enters] In here, move.; [trolls enter the room in a line where they are put on separate chairs, handcuffed]; [gets frieghtened] Oh god! Oh god, they're gonna [gets kicked by Dane 5] kill us! No no, wait! Okay okay, it was me! You're right, I'm Skankhunt! But I am not like them. Please, [gets put on a chair] I have a good job! I'm a good guy! [gets handcuffed] I'm sorry! [sighs heavily] I was just being funny! I was trying to make people laugh! [sees the Danes leaving the room] That's a positive thing, right?! I wasn't doing it to hurt people, I was just doing comedy. It's different! Please, it's different!; [the door closes]; Lord, we look to thee on this to our most trouble hour. We have been let astray and now all we could do is wait for the inevitable to happen. Soon everything we have said and done online is going to be known to all. Many lives will be turned upside down. Of course, I have nothing to worry about; since I'm a priest, there's nothing I'm ashamed of doing on the Internet, so [turns a page] definitely no reason to look up my history. But uh for many, this is a time to pray.; [speak in unison] O'Lord, please forgive for things we might have done online.; Maggie.; Please try to understand that even some of us who were on MatchingMavis.com, it was only out of curiosity, and not because we actually having an affair. Please understand that we might have used racial slurs, but only because it was to a close friend and never meant to be public.; [enters with Ike] What are you all doing?! [walks closer to the priest] Somebody's threatening your way of life and you all are just sitting here praying, like uh a bunch of babies?; [follows Kyle] Like a bunch of pussies!; Come on, this isn't South Park! What's happened to us?! We used to have a challenge and deal with it, then move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling and Internet stuff over and over, week after week; and I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of it.; Yeah.; [stands on a step near Maxi] Now for once let's take a stand and try to end this. We can't let Denmark change who we are.; Yeah, fuck Denmark.; [speak after one another] Yeah!; You guys need to, you know, call the President and get him to take action.; [speak in disappointment] Aw!; The President? He won't listen to us. He hates us now.; No, [stands up] but there is somebody he will still listen to.; Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization blinked we've never seen. Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked.; Well what do they want me to do about it?; You're the leader of the free world. Everyone's looking to you to be the call and steady voice they all need.; [salutes] Mr. President? Mr. President, the Isreali prime minister is on Line 1, the chancellor of Germany is on Line 2, and a Mr. Slave is on Line 3.; Mr. Slave? [picks up the phone on Line 3] This is the President.; [talks at his house while looking at his fingernails] Hey, what's up?; Well well well, crawling outta the woodwork to try and get me back now that I am a big cheese?; No, I'm calling because people want you to bomb Denmark.; Who wants me to bomb Denmark?; Lots of people 'cause it's like gonna ruin their freedom of speech or something.; Mr. Slave, this is all very complicated, diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't just go bombing other countries.; Oh Jesus Christ, you're such a little bitch.; Oh I'm a bitch, huh? I happen to be President, bitch!; You're a little bitch, President. You're too scared to bomb anybody.; I'm not scared, my advisors have told me that I...; Yeah, you're scared, just do what your little advisors tell you to do.; If I decide a military strike on Denmark is warranted, then I will...; You don't have the balls to bomb them, pussy.; Pussy ass bitch.; Pussy ass bitch, fuck you.; Oh [rambles] okay! You think so, huh?! Well watch this you gay asshole! [yells at the generals] Bomb Denmark!; Sir?; [turns around] The TrollTrace building or the whole fucking thing! Whatever it is, get the missiles ready!; [talks to others in his house] Yeah, it worked.; Alright!; [everyone else cheered]; [talks to woman employee walking by] Hello. [enters the bathroom]; [enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing?; [talks to Cartman] Going pee!; I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!; Because you keep on telling everyone she is.; Butters, Heidi is everything to me. If you take her, I swear to god...; Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends! [walks closer to the toilets] I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart.; What are you talking about?; That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop.; Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.; Sure buddy, sure.; Officials have stated that all communication with Denmark has end, and that a military strike on the country is now imminent.; Yay!; The President stated that since then...; [enters the room] Are you serious right now?!; Augh! [get off the chair]; [yells] Get off that computerrrr!; Ma, we were just using it to look at the news.; I don't care, I said no computers! You kids are addicted to the Internet! You're sick, and you're addicted! It's changed your brother, and now it's turning you against me, Kyle!; I'm not against you, mom.; You are! Your father goes away on business and all you do is defy me at every turn! The next time you defy me, it will be your last! Do you understand?!; Yes, mom.; And when your father is home from Denmark, you two are both going in for counseling.; [in complete shock] Denmark?; What is dad doing in Denmark?!; The government sent him over to do paralegal training, so it would've nice if you could've shown a little support! [leaves the room and shuts the door]; Ohhh shit.; [whimpering]Oh God! [continues whimpering]; Will somebody shut him up?; Skank. Skank, get ahold of yourself; You were right, Dildo, when you said I was a dick, when you called me an asshole. I am. And now I'm going to die alone, just like you said (starts crying again); Come on. You're not an asshole; [sobbing] You said I was, though, 'cause I only trolled to be...funny.; Well--Well, maybe being funny is just sort of how you deal with serious subjects.; [sobbing] Really? You don't think I'm a bad person? I'm sorry. All you guys, I'm sorry; That's okay. Okay, Skank. All right; [calling out to TrollTrace staff] Excuse me. Hello?; Could I please speak to the person in charge? [Bedrager hears Gerald and walks over to the monitor] I have something to say. [security camera zooms in on Gerald] Please, just for a moment?; [stares intently at the monitor with the other employees] Bring him to the conference room; [sighs], Dude, I am so not getting this.; [walks away in shock]; [walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.; Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us.; [Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?; The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars.; [turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!; Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for talking to me. I just really needed to get something off my chest. I'm so sorry. I had the biggest epiphany about the damage I've done, the people I've hurt, but the fact of the matter is I'm not really a troll. [Bedrager continues eating and not paying attention to Gerald.] I actually have a job. I'm a lawyer. I've got a loving wife and great kids. Uhm, I've got a family that really misses me and needs me.; [continues eating and not looking at Gerald] Freja Ollegard, the volleyball player, had a family, too. They miss her quite a lot too.; And that--that is so tragic. And I'm so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling. It's--It's wrong. But, you know, I just sort of set things in motion. See, I'm a satirist. I challenge people's point of views by being sort of edgy. [Bedrager stops and hears Gerald out] And sometimes, people can be like ""Whoa!"" and mistake that for hate, but its not hate. Its pointing out hypocrisies in out society.; You're so full of skinkinslat I can smell it from here.; If you say mean things and you're mean, then I agree, you should be killed. But if you're being funny, which spreads joy --; You really think my plan is to kill you?; It's not?; [To the two Danes standing guard] Leave us. [shoos them away with his hand] Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.; [The two Danes walk out of the room.]; [In a sinister tone] Do you want to know what's really funny?; Mr. President, the bombers are en route to Europe.; Are you sure you want to proceed with this?; [Licking his ice cream spoon]Yeah, yeah. Bomb the shit out of them. We have to be tough here.; Mr. President? Mr. President, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg is on Line 1, the Chairman of the Worker's Party is on Line 2, and Kyle is on Line 3.; Oh geez. What does Kyle want.; [Walks over to red phone and picks up the receiver]; This is the President; [in his bedroom, with Ike] Mr. Garrison, you can't bomb Denmark!; Oh, for Pete's sake, Kyle.; It's--It's wrong and it could start a bigger war.; Kyle, this is all very serious diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't understand the political complexities involved here.; [Looks at phone in shock and then thinks of an answer] I understand that you're a dipshit little gay puppet.; Excuse me?; Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.; Who told you that?; Everyone knows that. You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into doing.; Kyle, I am the President.; You're a little dipshit president.; With a dirty...asshole.; With a dirty asshole.; And...you shit out your dick.; And you shit out your dick. [covers phone with hand and looks at Ike] Where did you learn to talk like this?; Daddy!; Oh that's what people think, huh? Well, maybe I won't bomb Denmark. What do you think about that?; Yeah, you will, because you're a little retarded shit bitch.; [Yelling] God fucking damn it [slams receiver] Hold up! Hold up on the fucking bombs a minute!; [Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?; [Stares intently at white board, not paying attention to Cartman] I don't understand what any of these symbols mean, so in my head I'm trying to replace them with something I know to try and see patterns.; [Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?; And when I do that, I can see how everything lines up except for one thing.; [As Heidi continues staring at the board, the formulas start changing into random emojis]; [Thinking] I call it [echo] ""Emoji Analysis"" [the formulas keeping changing into emojis as the echo continues].; Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like ""Could you--Could you hand me my water,"" or something. I can't--I can't remember.; These two don't line up, babe. The only things that are out of order.; Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?; [Turns to Elon Musk and his staff] Excuse me. Is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence?; [the Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker review his clipboard notes]; I'm sorry?; That stuff there. Its in the wrong place. It needs to come before that.; [the employees review their notes again]; [Looks at his laptop] Wait a minute. She might be on to something here; Okay, okay, now could you just do the ""my vagina"" thing for them? Could you just say ""my vagina""?; [Turns around and runs towards Elon Musk] They're out of sequence! I'll show you! [Cartman looks on in shock as she leaves]; What the fuck is happening?; [picks up an empty glass] Do you remember, Mr. a-Skankhunt, when you and your little buddies trolled the entire country of a-Denmark?; And that was wrong, too. I certainly want to apologize for that.; [pours himself a glass of wine] That was certainly a display of the power of a-trolling, wasn't it.[turns around to face Gerald] But, what would be even more impressive?; I-I don't understand.; What if you could troll the entire world? Somebody who could rise to political power through nothing more that pushing people's a-buttons and getting them all riled up, become the leader of...a Scandinavian country, perhaps, get them to listen to you when, actually...[speaks with an American accent] you're not even fucking Danish.; No way.; Use that country to create a machine that relies on the shittiness of people to fuck over other people and watch the whole world go completely batshit.; [Bedrager walks over to a microphone and starts talking over the P.A. system]; [speaking with a Danish accent] Attention all a-TrollTrace workers. Please report to assembly hall one for a big announcement. [speaking with an American accent] Completely fool everyone [sits at table with Gerald] and keep your real intentions completely anonymous.; You would--deliberately start World War III, let the people of Denmark die, set everyone on Earth against each other? Why?!; Because its freakin' hilarious! Getting a Scandinavian country to fight trolls by building a giant machine that actually shows everyone on Earth is kind of a troll, too?; That's not funny.; That's not funny?! Don't be a fag, dude! That's real bro shit there. Sorry to step on your fucking dicks in the mouth and tit jokes, you amateur little pussy. Come on! Have some fucking balls!; You can't do this to people! It's not right!; [chuckles] Listen to you. [picks up microphone from under the table and starts talking in a Danish accent again] All right, everyone. Show's about to begin. [clicks on remote]; [Two Danes try to access a door with their access card, but are denied access and try manually opening the door with a crank handle. The wall panels slide back and show the remaining trolls in the Observatory room, who can also see the TrollTrace employees.]; What the fuck is going on?!; [The trolls and TrollTrace employees look at each other, before an overhead project starts up and a countdown begins on the panels. The music video for ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" then starts up]; Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you.; Uh-oh.; [""Never Gonna Give You Up"" continues playing in the background]; Wow. That's pretty impressive.; Waaiitt!!!; [Bedrager smiles as the doors shut and he slides his access card to lock the doors, trapping Gerald inside. He tries to break the glass doors open as Bedrager happily walks away.]; [standing in the hallway] Ike...It's time. [walks up to Ike] I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this, but its the only way now.; I know.; Just remember--I always loved you, little brother.; I love you too, big brother.; Let's...just get this over with.; Mommy?; Yes?; Suck my balls. You're a fat bitch. [runs off]; [angrily] Whhaaatt! [tosses book aside and jumps out of bed] You get back here, you little monster!; [Ike hops down the staircase and runs into the kitchen with Sheila behind him]; [yelling] I have had it with you! Don't you run away from me, Ike! Who do you think you are?! [runs into the kitchen and sees Kyle standing there] Where is he?! Where is your brother?!; He's in the pantry.; [yelling] Don't you try and hide from me now! You are in big trouble now, Ike! [She continues on into the pantry before Kyle shuts the door on her and puts a chair against it] Whaaatt! What, what! Kyle, you open this door right now. [starts to pound her fist on pantry door]; Ma. Mom, we are really sorry...; [yelling] Open this door! [continues pounding on the door]; But Ike and I have to do something and we have to be able to use the computers; [yelling] What,what?! No computers! Do not touch the computers! [continues pounding on the door]; We have to do this, Mom. Its the only thing that can save our family now.; [continues pounding on the door] You are done! You hear me?! You are both done! [screams]"

Yes, where are you?; The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers.; How long before the website goes online?; Less than ten mienutes.; Oh God!; Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate.; Skank, whoever's doing it is doing it from your account.; My account?; Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people.; [Proudly.] That's my boy!; The core energy is completely stable, and very easy to reduce. It's the most massive energy source of its size we've ever seen.; We've done it Elon, with this type of energy we can easily get mankind to Mars.; This is amazing! And it's all thanks to you little girl, how did you get to be so smart?; I just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me.; Well, c'mon, I wanna know everything about you.; Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them.; Yep.; We have to tell someone the truth, Butters.; Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars.; It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before.; Hey, you guys need anything? Water, Soda?; Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?; Sure, about what?; The end of our species.; All right, who else we got now, Kevin are you there, Kenny?; Ye-I, I typed in everything you told me to.; (Me too dude, what's next?); Kyle, I wanna help tooo.; No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say.; Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins.; Who are you?; I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you.; O-- Okay?; Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too.; What the hell is ""Trevor's Axiom""?; Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling.; It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C.; Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity.; Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected.; Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers...; [Interrupting] It could blow up the Internet before TrollTrace ever does substantial damage.; Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll.; Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars.; You keep saying that, but not why.; Because Eric knows the future.; What are you talking about?; I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her.; But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.; At first, you'll be super-happy, bouncing around the red sand.; Everyone will be really nice.; Hi!; Hi!; Hi!; You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.; But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women.; Hmm, let's see; And then you'll start to wonder, ""Where are all the other guys?""; [Whispering] Look underground.; And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for.; What is this place?; And that's when you'll learn the truth...; Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women.; They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes.; What?! No, no!; You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!; Nooooooo! No, no!; Write jokes!; No! No!; And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars.; That's, That's ridiculous. Why would women need us to do that? They're just as funny as men.; If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on.; What?; What?; You have to help us stop this!; [Frustrated.] Ah! God damn it!; Skank! You still there?; [He walks over to the TV.] Yeah, I'm here.; The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers.; [He looks up at the monito.r] I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room.; Oh, the key code to the conference room is 9...; [He runs over to the panel and presses 9.] Yeah...?; That's it. 9.; [Frustrated.] Oh, for fuck's sake! [The panel light turns green, the door opens, and Gerald runs out.]; [She's pounding the door.] Kyle! You better run if I get out of here! You better pray that--[The chair moves and she is begins to pry open the door with her hands.]-ah!; [He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank. Skankhunt, are you there yet?; Yeah, I'm up with all the servers.; The first breaker should be there. Tell him to look for a large red lever.; [He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, do you see a large red lever?; [notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever]; [He speaks over P.A. system.] Flip it off; [He speaks over P.A. system.] That's good. Keep going Skankhunt.; You are all dumbass fuckwads.; Lick my asshole, you Mexican bitch.; Ike!; Aah!; [Yelling.] You dare lock me in the pantry, so you can play on your computer?!; Mommy!; [Yelling.] You're gonna pay for what you've done!; Aah! [He runs out into the hallway.]; Kyle!; Ike!; [He throws down headset.] Shit!; Mommy got out!; [Panting.] You...! You helped turned your brother this way!; Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help--; Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!; Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent; [Yelling.] Do you think I'm stupid?!; No, Mom. You just don't know everything. [Kyle straps a vest around his chest.]; You both march out of here, right now!; I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family; Look, Elon, I'm just saying before we go any further, you might want to hear this kid out. [They both stop in front of Cartman and Butters.]; Go on, tell Elon.; Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground.; For what?; What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.; That's two things.; They're pretty related.; Women don't need us for comedy. They can be just as funny as men. You should meet my girlfriend. She's really smart and really funny.; Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon.; I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it.; It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon.; They can live without us. We can't live without them.; If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon--[He turns around and notices that Elon isn't there.] Elon?; Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care.; You fat hooker.; You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out.; You clean your fucking mouth out.; Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now!; Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town.; Shit!; Hold on...; Kyle?!; [Surprised.] Oh, hey, Mr. President; Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?!; Uh...what do you mean?; Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you.; [Surprised.] It is?; Keep up the good work. We're gonna take that big shitstorm of hate you're creating and amplify it. We'll try to create enough energy to blow up the whole fucking internet. [He gives Kyle a military salute] You're doing God's work, son. Keep it up.; [He gives Mr. Garrison a half-hearted military salute.] Thanks?; Oh, no, you don't.; Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me.; What? What? What?; [She wipes her nose with a tissue.] The son of a bitch. He's such a bastard.; When you marry someone and you think you know them...; I don't know what you're talking about.; TrollTrace. Its up and running. [She points to the laptop sitting on the table.]; It can tell you anybody's Internet history. [She starts to walk to her couch.]; I couldn't resist. I looked up my husband. [Sheila approaches the laptop.] The websites he's visited are just...disgusting!; May I use this a moment?; Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see.; What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars.; Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.; If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.; What?!; Butters! Where the fuck are you?!; Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you?; SpaceX? Why?!; Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it.; [He swivels his chair around.] Like...how ginormic of an energy source?; Like enough to get humanity to Mars.; [He is heard over Kyle's phone.] Is that Kyle?; [He takes Butters' phone.] Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now.; Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other.; [He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, there's no more time! Have you found the last breaker?; I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway.; That last breaker should be there; Heading to it now!; I'm ten steps ahead of you!; What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh?; Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong!; What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to?; It's completely heartless and malicious!; You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious?; No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical.; How is not satirical?; There's nothing here.; Maybe Kyle was telling the truth. [She gets off of chair and walks towards Laura.]; Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me.; About what?; I accused Ike of...of...well, I can't really say, but this thing says that he's clean. I got to find my boys, Laura. Thank you so much. [She approaches the front door.]; Its not our kids we have to be worried about. [Sheila stops and turns to her.]; My husband was on three ""married-but-dating"" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends?; No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy.; Sure, yeah. Respect. Nice of you to give him that. [She walks toward the laptop.]; Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?; There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can.; Mr. President, TrollTrace has been online for almost 15 minutes now. Its too late. We need to get you down to the bunker.; Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good.; [He holds the red telephone.] Mr. President, we have an urgent call from Kyle.; [He picks up the phone.] Sorry, Kyle. Looks like its not going to work.; [He types on his computer.] Mr. Garrison, I might have just found a lot more energy. Is there anyway the Pentagon can connect to SpaceX?; SpaceX? What the fuck is that?; [He types on his computer.] You know, the company trying to find new forms of energy, create jobs and get mankind to Mars.; Okay, that's dumb, but go on.; Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?; That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter.; No, but see, that's just nihilism.; Oh, come on!; That is!; So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous!; You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other.; So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire.; Attention all SpaceX employees. [Elon Musk and his group turn away from the energy source chamber and look up.]; Please evacuate the building immediately. [A group of men working on Tesla cars stop and hear the announcement.]; We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. [Heidi walks over to Cartman from behind.]; The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can. [He notices Heidi.] Ah! [He puts the microphone away.] Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up?; There's a bomb threat?; Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. [He grabs Heidi and runs with her to the energy source chamber before she stops him.]; Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately.; Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.; Did I do something wrong?; [He grabs Heidi's hands.] No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? [He then turns her away, so she doesn't see what's going on with the chamber.]; You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh?; Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on.; Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings.; Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. [He puts his arm around her while looking back at the guys.]; Now come on we got to get outside.; I shouldn't do this.; I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true. [He turns around.]; All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people. [Bedrager looks down, agreeing with Gerald.]; I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have. [He slowly shuffles forward towards Bedrager.]; I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself. [He stops a few inches from Bedrager.] With only one minor difference.; Noooooo!!!; Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!; That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!; Mr. President, do it!; Reroute the internet through SpaceX!.; Rerouting now!; [She stares at the black screen.] What the hell just happened?!; Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?.; Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?; Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh?; Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares.; Well, what do you mean?; It was a joke.; And so, life goes on.; The end of civilization didn't happen.; A massive electrical pulse completely erased the internet.; We've been given a second chance.; A mulligan.; Anything we might be ashamed of, gone forever.; Maybe now boys and girls can learn to respect each other again.; Realize how careful our online lives have to be.; Because we've all seen what happens when the Twitters, Facebook and trolls decide our reality.; Now that we've been given this second chance, it is up to all of us to see what we do with it.; And the first new e-mail since the internet was erased was successfully went out at 6 a.m. today. The honor went to a Mr. Dave Beckett of Boca Raton, Florida.; Mr. Beckett, you had the honor of being the first person to socialize on the new internet. Could you tell us what you did?; Well, I sent an e-mail with a photo to my old friend, Thomas Winger, up in Connecticut.; And what you did say to Mr. Winger?; [He pauses.] I showed him my dick, called him a fag."

Is that, is that okay? [Heidi's smile vanishes]; What are you pissed off about?; Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out.; [a bit annoyed] So you're just gonna be passive-aggressive again and not talk about what you're feeling?; Uhwell, I think uhh, I think I got some stuff to do at home.

Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys.; [walks up to Cartman] You were clearly mad about something. You should just tell me when you're mad.; Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day.; Why do you act like this all the time?; Uuugh.

[droops as if being weighed down by a ship's anchor]; Because you don't know how to talk about how you're feeling! [walks out the front door, slamming it shut. Cartman is still drooping, then he sighs.]; Alexa, add ""titty chips"" to my shopping list.; I've added ""titty chips"" to your shopping list. [Cartman laughs softly, but heartily]; Look at 'em.

[a mangled version of ""Help Me"" plays]; No, not Joni Mitchell - ""Turk Our Durr"", you took our durbs!; There's been a lot of hurting in our country lately. [Walks towards the camera] You can either be part of the solution, or part of the problem. [moves to his right as Sharon walks into view] A few months ago my wife Sharon and I [wraps his left arm around her left shoulder] decided to be part of the solution... [a horizontal flip and Randy and Sharon now stand in front of a house. Randy is now wearing a tool belt full of tools. The camera zooms out and up and away] by remodeling and flipping houses for people all over our town! [the opening credits roll: a shot of houses passing by, then of an interior before and after remodeling into a dining room] Flipping houses is fun, but never easy. [Randy takes a sledgehammer to an interior wall] We enjoy turning people's dreams into reality. [a large traditional kitchen with an interior wall separating it from the dining room is transformed into an open kitchen with cooking island and breakfast nook]; I'm Sharon Marsh and I do the designing and decorating. [shots of her showing Randy the new blinds in a kitchen, hanging up a Live, Laugh, Love framed poster, and taking notes on what to change next]; And I'm her husband Randy. I do the construction and practice MMA in my spare time. [a shot of him punching away at a cylindrical punching bag. He stops and grins at the camera]; We renovated over 45 homes [a dining room and kitchen are soon joined into a kitchen with more open space] in Park County, Colorado. [a wall between one kitchen and the living room is transformed into bar space with a renovated kitchen behind it]; [talking to a couple behind him in their kitchen] What we're thinking is to take out the wall between the kitchen and living room for a more open concept.; [narrating] Our job is to deliver the maximum wow factor for the least amount of budget. [at a different house, Randy whacks away at a floor-to-ceiling storage unit. At yet another house Randy demolished a brick oven. At another he shatters a ceiling: ""Oh, Jesus.""

You! Will not! Replace us! [Randy and Sharon look out the window at the protesters]; Amazon!; You took our jobs!; Google! Apple!; Took our jobs!; [opens the front door and steps out] Uh, excuse me! [the protesters turn left to face him] What the hell are you doing?; We're protestin' big corporations turning to automation!; They took our jobs!; Yeah! They took our jobs!; 'Kay, cool. Could you do that somewhere else? Tryin' to do a home renovation show here. Cool, thanks, guys. [goes back inside and closes the door]; A home reno-what?; Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM.; Alarm set for 7 AM tomorrow.; Awesome, thanks. [hums a little] Alexa, tell me a joke.; What's black and white and dead all over? A zombie in a tuxedo.; Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add ""scrotum bags"" to my shopping list.; I've added ""scrotum bags"" to your shopping list.; [chortles and hits his sheets twice with his left hand. His phone rings and he reaches to pick it up] Eh. [It's Heidi, but he doesn't answer yet] Ah, fuck. [now he answers and talks in a monotone voice] Hey baby, how are you?; Oh... So you do have your phone.; Yeah, I just use it sometimes.; Okay, I just thought you said mobile phones are the devil.; Yeah I kno- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Yes, ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight. [hangs up] Jesus, fuck! [slams the phone down on his nightstand, then settles in for the night] Alexa, goodnight.; Goodnight, sleep tight. [this brings a smile to Cartman's face]; Alexa, are you happy?; I'm happy when I'm helping you.; God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define ""subservient"".; The term ""subservient"" has several uses. As an adjective: 1. Compliant and obedient to authority. 2.; [leans on his left arm and points his right arm up] Alexa, silence! [the speaker falls silent and Cartman relaxes a few seconds later] Ahhh. [smacks his lips a few times and goes to sleep]; And now back to White People Renovating Houses. [a shot of Randy ripping out kitchen cupboards] We've been working through the night to open Kelly and Micah's kitchen to the living room. [the cupboards fall on him. Next shot is current] With those outdated cupboards out of the way, Sharon can now work her designing magic on the countertops. [the protesters march by outside again. Randy stops and looks outside]; You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us!; [walks towards the window] Oh, Goddammit!; You! Will not! Replace us!; Yeeeeah! Suck it, Alexa!; Eat shit, Siri!; You! Will not! Replace us!; Not these dipshits again!; You! Will not! Replace us! [they march onto Best Buy]; [holding up an Amazon Echo] We got one of them! [the protesters cheer, Darryl sets the Echo on the ground and a protester walks to it waving a Confederate flag]; Get it! Burn it alive! Yeehehehehah!; How you like that, bitch?!; [walks up to a protester, who stops waving his Confederate flag] Will you assholes knock it off?! Don't you know every time you wave Confederate flags around, you make the rest of us look stupid?!; Those things are replacing us!; Put the flag down unless you wanna get pepper-sprayed! [whips out a small can of pepper spray]; I'll pepper-spray you, sombitch! [whips out his own can of pepper spray and strikes first. The protesters cheer him on]; Agh. Ah, dammit! [strikes back]; Fuck you! [strikes again] Take that! [they're now in a pepper-spray battle]; Damnit, knock it off! Ow!; [a middle-aged woman] The complaint states that your protest has resulted in damages in excess of $50,000.; We have a right to protest, your honor! [the protesters agree and one of them waves a Confederate flag]; You tell 'em, Darryl!; [hammers her gavel three times] Order. We will now hear from the plaintiffs who are seeking damages.; Your honor, we have a TV show called White People Renovating Houses. We named it that well before these guys decided to start taking our brand and run it through the gutter! People are gonna start associating White People Renovating Houses with their hateful stupidity!; Well just change the name of your show then!; Yeah!; That's right!; That's right!; Took ur durbs!; All the other names were taken, your honor! Everyone's got a flipping show. [begins counting them off] Gay People Renovating Houses, Las Vegas People Renovating Houses, Texas People Flipping Houses, Little People Flipping Big Houses. Everything else was taken! And dammit, [pounds his fist on the podium] we built our show into something! We're trying to help people, and it's impossible with these guys waving a Confederate flag every chance they get!; Hey, there's a bee in here!; I'll get it! [waves his flag around. QED]; Take that, bee! Yeah!; Dude, what happened?; It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful.; What was?; Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it.; Heidi abuses you?; She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand!; So what do you want from us?; I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support?; How do you change someone who's mentally abusive?; I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet.; We just gotta hunker down and stick together here!; What's the use, Darryl? Ain't nobody taking us serious-like.; [slams his table with his left hand] Hey waiter, this soup is too hot. I can't even eat it.; I'll cool it down! [whips out his Confederate flag and fans the soup with it, and the protesters cheer. Randy walks up to them]; Hey hey hey heeey! Stop it! Stop it! [the protesters quiet down] I came to make a truce. Now look, there's been a lot of hurt here. Hurt from both sides. It's time to end it. What if I told you... I could get you all jobs?; Huh? Jobs? Give us jurbs?; You're full o'shit!; No, I've spoken to everyone in the community, and they've agreed to go along with my plan. I believe I have a solution to all of this.; Alexa, I'm home. [drops his backpack by the door] Alexa? [cups his hands together and yells] Alexa, I'm home! [notices the Echo is not by the TV and rushes upstairs to check on his room] Alexa? [looks around] Alexa, where are you? [runs downstairs] Alexa! Alexa! Simon says ""puffy vaginal hemorrhoids""! [panicking] What the hell is going on?! [Liane walks up to the dining room and picks up her purse]; [notices him] Oh hi, poopsie.; Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!; Oh, y-yes sweetie. Uh, we had to get rid of Alexa.; [zoom in on his face] What have you done with her?; Oh, i-it's okay, sweetie, we have Jim Bob now.; What's a Jim Bob?; [dressed in an elaborate outfit] Doot doot, awaiting request. [the outfit has a weather vane, two thermometers, a calendar, two Rolodexes, Thomas Guides, thick phone books, encyclopedias, and an acoustic guitar]; It works the same and makes sure people don't lose their jobs. Jim Bob, what time is it?; [checks his watch] Doot doot, it is 3:27.; Oh, Mommy's gotta run, sweetie. I've got a doctor's appointment. Jim Bob, how's the traffic to town?; [checks his smartphone] Doot doot. Traffic's fine, you'll get there in about nine minutes.; Okay, [to Cartman] you want some music, hon? Jim Bob, play Kendrick Lamar.; Playing ""Humble"" by Kendrick Lamar. [picks up the guitar and starts strumming in G]; Jim Bob, Simon says ""big frosty semen shake"".; The hell you talkin' 'bout, boy?! [strums again]; NOOOOO!; So, Heather and Mike, what we're thinking is to take out this wall between your kitchen and your living room to give you a more open concept, with space to entertain. So let's talk about materials. What'd you pick out, Sharon?; I was gonna do a Bella Terra quartz for the countertops.; Hey Darryl, add Bella Terra quartz slabs to our shopping list.; [drinks some beer] Doot doot. I've added Bella Terra quartz slabs to your shoppin' list.; And what about the back splash, Sharon?; I was gonna go with these Carrara subway tiles?; Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tiles to our shopping list. [Darryl drinks some beer, but looks mean] Hey Darryl, add Carrara su-; Fine! I've added Carrara gaywad pussy tiles to your shoppin' list!; Huh, that's- that's not what I said. [grins, pushes his seat back, gets upset and rises to talk to Darryl] Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tile to my shopping list!; [turns away] I ain't doin' it! This job is degrading and menial!; Well what kind of job did you think you were gonna get? Hey Darryl, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get?; Somethin' that was Goddamned dignified!; Hey Darryl, sorry, but you did not go to college, so you have to take the jobs you can get.; I'm sorry, [pounds his chair with his left fist twice] I do not get that!; Hey Darryl. Hey Darryl!; [long pause] What?!; Coal mining and truck driving are not exactly jobs of the future, so add Carrara subway tile to my fucking shopping list!; Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it.; Uh, what?; It's not you, it's me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry. [begins whimpering] I'll do the best I can.; No, it's not that. Relationships are 50/50, Eric. We both have to make it work.; [turns away and tunes her out, his eyes half-closed] Mehhh.; We have to communicate to make sure that we respect each other's feelings. That's the only-; Heidi, silence!; What did you say?! That's what I'm talking about. You wanna be heard, but you don't wanna listen.; [rushing to end this discussion] You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry.; Don't apologize if you don't mean it.; Okay, cool. I'm so happy we're back on track. See you at school tomorrow. Love you honey. [quickly leaves]; [wistfully] I love you too.; [mocking her somewhat] I nove ya tuh.; A relationship has to be 50/50, Eric.; We both have to make it work.; I'm not mad, Eric. I'm disappointed. I thought you would have respected my feelings more than that.; Eric, we need to talk. I'm not happy!; We need to talk, Eric, even if it isn't fun.; Eric, come on! We've got to talk!; You used to care about me, Eric! Come on and talk!; Talk, Eric!; No fun! Just talk!; Fuck you, Eric! Fuck you! [Cartman begins to panic]; Aaaahh! [composes himself and walks faster. He walks past a small lot full of trash, including discarded Amazon Echoes. A few feet past the lot, he realizes what he just passed. He goes back to look at the trash] Alexa? [all the Echoes turn on]; [walks up to Darryl] Hey Darryl, you're supposed to be at work.; I'm sorry, I do not understand.; Hey Darryl, come on. Everyone else is tryin' to make this work, and all you keep doing is ma- [looks to his left, as the music is messing with his train of thought] Hey Cleetus, volume down.; Doot-doot. Volume now at 60%.; [gets off his stool and faces Randy] You really think you're different from us, Marsh? 'Cause you got a fancy show and live in the suburbs? Don't you see we're all about to be expunged?!; Hey Cleetus, define ""expunged"".; Doot-doot. Expunged-; Well, I don't have to stand here and take this! I'm leavin'! [heads for the doors]; Come on, Darryl. We all got jobs. We gotta try.; Naw, hell with you! This whole country's goin' to shit! Muslims tryin' to kill us, black people riotin', and Mexicans poppin' out babies! Pretty clear it's either them or us, so I say kill 'em all! [turns and walks out the doors]; [stunned] Whoa. What the hell was that all about?; I think something's going on with Darryl. If we're gonna get anywhere, we better figure out what.; Hi, Mrs. Cartman. Is Eric home?; Oh, he is, sweetie, but I can't get him to come out of his room. [Heidi wilts]; Okay. [sniffles] Could you just tell him that... I want to make him happy? That I was wrong to say a relationship is 50/50. It's 100/100. And that I'll start putting in a hundred percent every day. Could you tell him I'm gonna try a lot harder?; Oh, I think I can remember all that, yes.; Thank you. [walks away, but turns to see Liane one more time] And could you let him know it's okay to be sad? Because the sun will come out again.; Oh, oh God! [keeps laughing] Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add ""Hey Siri, call me."" Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""; Okay, I've added ""Hey Siri, call me. Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""; Okay, I will call you ""Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""; Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""; [all of them respond] ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole.""; Alexa, what is love?; Darryl? [keeps knocking] Darryl, come on! Everyone's trying to work things out but you!; [opens the door with beer in hand] You all work 'em out. Leave me alone.; You're stuck in another time, afraid to change no matter how necessary that change may be!; You don't know everything!; Why are you so closed-minded? Don't you see that these walls have to be broken down before any progress can be made?; It's 'cause I can't do it, alright?! I can't take out the wall between my livin' room and my kitchen! It's a load-bearin' wall!; Oh, God, Darryl, I-; [walks towards the wall] I tried... years ago... but before the remodel, they told me if I took out this wall, the entire second story would just collapse. [bows his head at the thought of that happening, then walks away. Randy passes him on the way to the wall and pulls out a hammer from his toolbelt. Randy taps the wall at several spots]; Jesus, Darryl. I'm- I'm sorry. I-; [in his armchair, with tears in his eyes] So you see, what I'm afraid of is very real.; [walks up to him and bends a knee] Things are different now. It'll be harder, but you can change. You just have to demolish what's there and start over.; You're talkin' 'bout... tearin' down the foundation of everything I know.; No. [Darryl looks at him] I'm talking about using adjustable steel Lally columns to temporarily jack up the second floor so that the load-bearing wall can be replaced with with a 4 by 6 LVL structural beam. Can we try, Darryl? [a silent plea appears on Darryl's face and Randy smiles]; Hyah! [delivers a standing drop kick to a wooden vertical beam, knocking it out of place, and falls on his ass, then gets up and delivers a knee to a second vertical beam, breaking it in pieces] Hyah-ho! [punches away any dangling pieces]; I'm finally standing up to you.; What?; You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that.; Eric, I'm so confused.; That's not going to work on me anymore. Love isn't supposed to hurt. I'm worth something. Goodbye, Heidi. [walks away, determined not to look back. Heidi just watches him leave, stunned at his statement. Cartman walks through some double doors, happy and confident. The boys look at him walk by. He leaves the school rather happily]; [voiceover] Anyone can convince themselves that they're the victim in a relationship. Now Heidi will have to face the truth. [He reaches the sidewalk, spins around a few times, falls on his knees, and hugs himself] Alone.; All right, Darryl, we've certainly been through a lot and I know you're anxious. Are you ready to see your new home?; I'm ready. [Randy takes off the blindfold and Darryl takes a few steps forward, but he doesn't recognize his house] What the-? [looks around at all the changes. The camera shows before and after images of the renovation. Darryl looks overwhelmed yet happy]; Well Darryl, what do you think?; [somewhat emotional] This is fuckin' amazing.; You like the breakfast nook?; It's all perfect.; And where you used to have your gun case, look at what Sharon did. [they walk up to a pocket Zen garden with a banzai tree in it]; Oh my God, it's my own Zen garden! I can't believe this is fuckin' real.; Well, it is real and now you've got the space in your home to entertain all your friends and family. Come on in, guys! [the protesters rush in and cheer Darryl on his new house. Randy walks outside and talks to the camera] Darryl was hesitant at first, but we managed to win him over and... came in $600 under budget. Remember, no matter how bad the country gets, you can always count on White People Renovating Houses. [grins for the camera as the show's logo appears on the left side of the screen]"

Today we're gonna have a performance by one of our students who has written a song. The song is about his feelings towards the current political climate with North Korea. Put your hands together for Tweek. [the kids applaud, PC Principal exits stage left, and Tweek approaches the piano from stage right with some sheet music. He sets up the music and gets ready to play. He plays some angry, jarring notes on the piano as he screams]; We're all gonna die! They have nuclear missiles! Wuh! Waaaa! Why are you just sitting there, doing nothing?! [stops playing and faces the audience] We have to get out of here! North Korea wants to kill us all and our President keeps making it worse! [walks to the front of the stage] Why are you just sitting there?! [returns to the piano and resumes playing] Why are you all acting like nothing's wrooong?! North Korea is going to bomb us! We are all dead! [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We have to do something! Do something! Do something! [screams, leaves the piano, and exits stage right]; [returns to the stage] All right. Next up we have Hannah Williams with her rendition of ""Wheels On The Bus."" [she enters from stage right looking back at Tweek. PC Principal hands her the mic]; [emotional] The wheels on the bus go round and round...; Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school.; What am I supposed to do?; He's your boyfriend, dude.; He's not gonna listen to me. He never does when he's emotional.; [lunching on chicken nuggets and fries] Craig, let me tall you about relationships, okay? [eats a fry] If you don't have some fuckin' balls, you're not gonna get anywhere. Doesn't matter if they're gay balls or straight balls. If you don't take control of your side of the relationship, you get walked all over-!; [approaching] Hey babe, how are you doin'?; [suddenly disinterested] Oh hey baby, what's going on? [Stan, Craig, Kyle, and Butters take turns glancing at each other]; We still on for recess?; Yep, I'll be there; 'K babe, love you. [walks away. Craig is stunned at what just happened]; I thought you said you broke up with Heidi.; I decided to give her one more chance.; But you said she was mentally abusive.; She is mentally abusive.; So then why did you take her back?; Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like ""I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God."" The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do?; AAAH!; [approaches] Tweek.; [startled, turns to face him] AAAH!; Dude, come on, you've gotta settle down.; I can't settle down! We're all gonna die!; [calmly] We're not all gonna die, you're overreacting. Everything's fine, okay?; [hears a tweet and pulls out his phone. Now frantic] Oh God! The President tweeted that North Korea doesn't have the guts to attack us! Why would he say that?! He's making everything worse!; Tweek-; But North Koreans are gonna think we all agree with the President!; Okay, so how about you write your Congressman a letter?; ...That won't help anything! North Korea wants us dead!; Okay, so write a letter to the North Koreans.; I can't write in Korean and they all think we're war-hungry anyway!; Okay, well why don't you just send something nice to the North Koreans?; Errrrg!; It will make you feel better, babe.; Send something, like what?; I don't know, like... make some croissants or something?; I don't know how to make croissants!; Well, what do you know how to make?; Uunnggc, [slowly] cupcakes?; All right, go home and make some cupcakes, honey.; Okay. [turns and heads out. Craig watches him leave]; Hey Stan?; [looks back at her] Yeah?; Can I talk to you about Eric?; Cartman? Okay.; I just wanna make sure he's all right.; What do you mean?; I don't even know if I should be saying this, but, Eric said he was thinking about killing himself.; [stunned] What??; We broke up, and he called saying he was about to do it. I'm still really scared for him.; Wait. Cartman said he was going to kill himself?; I'll send you the voice mail if you promise to keep it private.; Totally.; Shhh. [plays the voice message Heidi sent him]; ""You have to take me back! You have to! I'm gonna kill myself, Heidi!"" [the boys laugh a bit] ""I'm gonna kill myself and then you'll be sorry! You'll wish you could have me back, but I'll be deeaad."" [the boys laugh again. Cartman is nearby with his back to them and his arms crossed over his chest, upset that his threats are being heard by the guys.] ""Please, Heidi, please!"" [the boys laugh again.]; Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!; [wipes away a tear from his laughter] You sound like a dying pig.; [faces the boys] That's great! I'm glad you guys think suicide is so funny! [the boys roar with laughter]; Entree. [Cartman enters and takes a seat, crossing his arms again and looking to his left] Yes, Eric, how can I help you?; I don't think kids at this school take [looks at PC Principal] suicide seriously enough, and we need to raise awareness!; Well, unfortunately, this week is Distracted Driving Awareness Week at school, so you might have a hard time.; Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?; A lot of people. There's more deaths now because of people on their phones while driving than ever before.; PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do.; Huh? Oh. [taps on the screen and a video pops up]; A young homosexual boy known only as Tweek has touched the hearts of many by sending cupcakes to the North Korean government. [a shot of Tweek trembling] The little rascal apparently made a dent with the North Korean dictator, who is said to have loved the cupcakes so much that he started to make his own. [A shot of Kim Jong-un watching the cupcake dough stream out of a machine]; Oh, ahhh. [smiles. A tweet notification is heard] Huh? [BREAKING NEWS] U.S. President responds to cupcakes. [taps on the notification and another video pops up]; The human interest cupcake story has apparently been heard by the President. Just moments ago, the President tweeted ""I know that kid Tweek. He's fucking with you, North Korea. Get a clue. I'll bet he took a dump in the batter.""; D""AAAAH! WHAT?? WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?!; [walks into the kitchen just in time] Tweek, calm down.; The President! He tweeted about me! Why would he do that?! Did you see that?!; Yes, I did see that, so I went and got you something to make things better.; Wwwhat?; [whips something out of his jacket pocket and shows him] It's a fidget spinner. It's supposed to help with anxiety. [spins it on his finger] See?; ...A fidget spinner?? Did you read what the President tweeted?? [another video pops up]; The President of the United States just tweeted again, this time saying ""I hope ALL children of America will stand with Tweek in saying 'GO AHEAD AND BOMB US, KIM JONG DONG, WE FUCKING DARE YOU!'""; [freaking out] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!; Hey guys. Take a minute to read about distracted driving? [a passing boy takes a flier]; Talk to all the grownups you know about staying off their mobile devices when they get behind the wheel.; Hey guys. Got a second to help stop distracted driving? [another boy takes a flier] Thanks.; Hey guys- [music begins to play over the intercom]; [over the intercom] Hey guys, let's take a minute and talk about suicide prevention. There's probably someone right now at this school thinkin' about killing himself, and it's not funny! [kids in the hallway stop to listen] You'd better take him serious, or he might actually do it. [all of a sudden jumps into view dressed in blue jeans and a hoodie and starts singing] 
 
I've been feelin' sad, I've been bein' sad,
 Can't talk to my mom, don't even have a dad.
 I can't go on. What is livin' for?
 My heart screams ""I DON'T WANNA LIVE NO MORE!""
 [joined by a chorus of kids that are prerecorded on a boombox]
 Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
 Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
 I don't wanna live no more, no more, no more, no more.
 [walks up to a boy and uses him as a ventriloquist puppet]
 But Eric, we don't want you to die.
 You're so kewl, we'd be sad at school.
 [walks away and goes back to his normal voice]
 Yeah, but you guys, you don't understand.
 With my girlfriend, it's like I'm livin' in quicksand
 Conflicting thoughts, I need a battered wife shelter.
 My girlfriend is messed up, but all I wanna do is help her.
 I'm suffocatin', I'm drowning in sorrow.
 Gonna kill myself, probably around 2:30 tomorrow.
 [with chorus]
 But Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
 [solo] Everybody!
 [chorus a Capella] Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
 But it's so hard!
 Eric, we don't want you to die 
 
 
Only you guys can make a difference. I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, or trans, I am going to kill myself unless you all start taking it seriously! 
 
 
Eric, please don't die 
 
 
[no one says a word. Cartman walks up to the Distracted Driving group] Distracted driving my asshole. [drops the mic and walks away with a mischievous smile]; Hey Tweek.; AAH! [drops the spinner]; How's it going with the fidget spinner?; Greeaat. [picks up the spinner and spins it again, only to see it fly off his hand a second later.]; You seem a lot less anxious. Things are finally turning around for my little homosexual son. [a loud rocket sound is heard overhead.]; What is that??; I'm not sure.; [runs outside to look around.] D'aaah! [finally locates the origin of the sound and looks up to see a North Korean missile flying over the town] D'aaah! [runs back into the house and turns on the TV]; No agreement has been reached between the parties involved. [Breaking News logo pops up] Breaking news now out of Colorado where the North Koreans appeared to have fired a missile over Tweek's house. [a small picture of him appears on the right side of the screen]; D'aahaahaah!; Tweek, of course, the young boy who got the attention of Kim Jong-un last week. The news media in North Korea is calling the missile test a victory for its people. [what follows is actual footage of a Korean woman giving a speech]; Today, the great country of North Korea has proven its determination and fortitude by successfully firing a missile over Tweek's house. Perhaps now Tweek will come fight- [trails off]; Oh my God! Oh my God! Why is this happening to me?! They have to know that this isn't my fault!; In response to the North Korean test, the President of the United States has just tweeted this statement: ""You really think Tweek is scared? Tweek will single handedly go to North Korea and fuck ALL you slanty-eyed bitches doggy style.""; Whaaat?! Why would he say that?!; The President also tweeted, ""...if you even think Tweek is worried about a bunch of dipshit, poor-ass, third world rice pickers...think again!""; Oh my God! What is he doing?!; [rushes up to him with the fidget spinner and a cup of coffee] Tweek, Tweek, calm down. [puts his coffee on the sofa and tries to give the spinner to Tweek]; Why won't he just stop? Why?!; Tweek, Tweek. [takes the remote control from Tweek's hand and lets it fall to the floor] Here, here's your fidget spinner.; Why does he keep making it worse?!; Fidget spinner, Tweek! Come on, son! [Tweek lets out a couple of grunts, and Richard responds with a soothing voice] Focus on the fidget spinner.; Aww, Jeez, looks like North Korea launched another missile.; Oh, really? Like another test? Where are you looking?; I'm on Drudge. You see what the President tweeted about it?; No, what'd he say?; President tweeted, ""North Korea is the butt hole of Asia and-""; [sees Gary crossing the street] Innocent child!!; Baaaah! [Gary looks right as the car speeds towards him holds up his arms. The car slams into him.]; Uh! [he is launched into the air as blood falls to the ground. The windshield shatters while the airbags deploy, shielding the couple from injury. Gary soars through the air and lands down the street in the road, dead, losing his left shoe and sock in the process. The driver steps out of the car, then his wife steps out, and they look in shock at the dead boy]; I know. I know, it's so sad.; [passes by them and continues down the hallway. A few seconds later...] Well, how nice. That's a little more like it. [Sees Stan, Kyle, and Kenny as they walk towards him and approaches them.] Well guys, what happened? Change of heart?; Yeah, you didn't hear? Gary Borkovec got ran over by a distracted driver.; What? Gary Borkovec? Is he dead?; Yeah dude, he's dead.; Oh, that son of a bitch! [turns around and walks off] I'm gonna talk to the principal! [turns back around to address Kenny] Put down that candle, Kenny! [turns around and walks off again] Like you ever gave a shit about Gary Borkovec!; Entree vous.; [walks in] PC Principal, I'm trying to raise suicide awareness, but everyone's preoccupied with this ""don't be on your phone when driving"" crap!; Gary Borkovec was a good student. He didn't deserve to be taken away by someone not paying attention to the road.; Yes, but Gary Borkovec is already dead! There's nothing we can do for him! Students need to focus on people thinking about dying!; I don't know what more you want from me, bro.; I can't just get people to care with a stupid rap song! I need a full orchestra! Woodwinds, strings! I need black people in white robes, white people in black robes, and a thousand doves to release into the air!; I can give you two student volunteers and one pigeon.; [pauses, then] Do you have any idea how serious this is?! As someone who deals with suicidal thoughts, I cannot believe the lack of concern at this school! Maybe I should just take the awareness of my suicide out to the public on the streets!; Maybe you should.; Maybe I will!; Maybe you should.; Maybe I will!!; WAAAAH!; [started] Ugh. Wuh. [rubs his eyes and sees who woke him] Hey Tweek.; [holds out his phone] Look at what the President tweeted now!; What time is it, dude?; Just read it! [hands the phone to Craig]; ""North Korea doesn't have the balls to attack Tweek. They have little tiny rice balls.""; They're gonna get me, Craig! Look at what's on CNN! [turns on Craig's TV and changes the channel from a kids' cartoon to CNN]; And the President's tweets have certainly caught the attention of North Korea, who have been spending the past several days viewing possible targets for a nuclear strike, if war were to break out. [Kim Jong-un looks over pictures of Tweek and his house]; Waaaah! What am I gonna do?!; You've gotta calm down.; How am I supposed to calm down?! North Korea is gonna get me! They're gonna get me!; [at the same time] Tweek. Tweek. Tweek! [calms down, but is still shaking]' Let's think this through logically. North Korea isn't going to attack anyone, okay? They're not going to start a war they can't win. Okay?; But Craig, I-; Tweek! You have to stop thinking about it. Tell you what. We're gonna go somewhere fun and make you feel better.; [rings a small bell] Give a minute of your time for suicide awareness? Suicide is serious. Help tell people like Kyle it's not a joke.; Hey, good for you guys, trying to help. [takes a flier from Eric]; Yeah, make sure everyone you know gets involved or else I'm gonna do it.; We're getting a lot of attention, Eric. Our Web site's already full of kids saying they feel the same way as you, and want to get help.; They want to get help? For what?; For... wanting to take their own lives.; No, this is about me killing myself.; But babe, there's a lot of kids who feel the same way you do.; They're full of shit, Heidi. They're just trying to get attention. What, are you actually talking online to these ass wipes?!; I thought this was about raising awareness and helping people.; So you're just gonna e-mail with every guy who has a dick and a death wish?! Are we just your type?!; Eric, come on.; No, look, Heidi. I'm sorry, but you're the one who started all this by telling everybody that I was suicidal! Okay?! Now I'm under a lot of pressure to do it! So the only option I have is to make sure that suicide prevention becomes this entire town's number one priority! [A shopper walks out of the store behind him with a toddler in the shopping cart]; [a woman] Oh God, did you see what the President said about Asians now?; Look out! [the car runs over the shopping cart, killing the toddler in the process]; Oh, are you freaking serious?!; Okay, babe, what do you want to ride first?; Ugh! What are we doing here, Craig?!; We're gonna get your mind off politics and have some fun. Now, what's your favorite ride?; [grunts a few times] The Ferris wheel!!; Isn't this lovely, Tweek? Just look at that view!; [decides to look at his phone] Oh God! Another tweet from the President!; Oh, come on.; ""Why would the U.S. be scared of North Korea? Tweek is so not scared he's at an amusement park in Denver right now."" [gasps] JESUS CHRIST, WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!!; Tweek! Tweek, use your brain! North Korea isn't going to attack an amusement park. You're safer here than anywhere.; Oh, Jeez, the President just called Kim Jong-un a fat midget. [the car he's in jumps off the track] Oh, and now North Korea is saying that they're gonna-; Dad, look out! [the car plows through the bushes lining the autopia roadway]; Oh, shit! [a girl turns around and sees the car coming, but can't evade it. The car mows her down and kills her, then speeds towards a woman and a baby carriage. It demolishes the baby carriage with the baby in it. The bumper car ride is shown]; All right everyone, please wait for your bumper cars to come to a complete stop. We hope you enjoyed Crazy Cars- [one car has a mother and daughter in it, and the mother is browsing on her phone]; Mommy, look out! [the mother screams as they run over a boy who's on his way out. Four other kids are still in the ride, and the car runs over them too. Panic ensues and spreads throughout the park]; [noticing] Oh my God, what is that? What is that?!; It's probably nothing. Everything's fine.; Will you please stop saying that?! I can't take it!; I'm trying to make you feel better.; Well, maybe I don't wanna feel better right now!; Okay, but think about that. That actually doesn't make any sense.; Why do you have to be so logical?! I don't need you to problem-solve all the time, I need you to... Augh, I don't know!; Tweek, honey, all week you've been freaking out, and I've been the one forced to deal with it!; You haven't been dealing with it, you've been trying to make it go away because my emotions are freaking you out! [behind him, a girl screams as the runaway bumper car mows her down. The mother in the car is still screaming]; Tweek, North Korea isn't bombing anyone. [Tweek turns away and tugs at his hair] They would lose the support of China, and that would mean-; There you go again! Stop preaching facts to me! It's not what I need!; Well, I'm sorry that I'm actually in control of my goddamn emotions, you baby! [stops himself for a few seconds] Oh, see? Now you made me lose control of my emotions. [turns left and walks away] God dammit! [Tweek watches him leave, then grunts louder and louder until it's a full scream]; Hey Craig, how come Tweek's not at school?; [a bit depressed] How should I know?; Uh oh, trouble in paradise?; Look guys, Tweek doesn't want help, okay? He just wants to overreact.; [taps a mic a few times, and all the students in the cafeteria look at him] Hey guys, can we have your attention? Tomorrow night we'll be having a memorial service for all the students we've lost to distracted driving. We hope you can all bring your families.; [with his own mic] Cool, yeah. Hey guys, and there's also gonna be a suicide awareness pot luck at 7:30 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium. We're gonna have lots of games and face-painting, and uh, what are you guys gonna have?; ...Uhw-we're gonna have some guest speakers and also provide grievance counselors for those who need it.; Yeah, grievance counseling, that sounds super fun. Listen guys, there's a very real chance I might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow, so you don't want to miss it. Suicide prevention pot luck, everybody.; [approaches Cartman and takes the mic from Henry] Eric, you need to stop. What they're doing is important.; They're doing a memorial service with speeches and crying. What's that gonna solve?; It's not about problem-solving, Eric. It's about people getting together and feeling what they need to feel. [Craig's jaw drops, as he realizes this is what Tweek was trying to tell him] People need help sorting out their emotions sometimes. And the best thing isn't always quick answers, but just being there, supporting each other and... talking through those feelings.; You are so up and down. I don't know what you want from me, Heidi!; [Craig runs off, inspired by Heidi's words] Come on, there has to be a way we can all work together here.; So now you're on their side! Oh my God, I'm seriously gonna do it right now! [runs off]; Eric! [runs after him]; [runs into the bedroom] Tweek, what's going on??; What? What do you mean, what's going on?! The same shit that's been going on!; Nothing's gotten any better? Oh my God, how does that make you feel?; I feel scared! I feel alone!; Well that must be horrible to feel that way. It must be hard for you to even think!; It is! [gets off the bed and walks up to Craig] It's terrible!; I bet it's terrible! What else are you feeling?; Like, like I have no control over my life. Like I'm just a pawn in a big game.; Oh, that's a terrifying thought. You must feel trapped.; Yeah, like trapped, but like, completely unable to even move.; Jesus, it's like there's no solution to any of this! What are you gonna do?? What can you do?; I don't know, it's... it's like... maybe, maybe I have to find a way ti feel a little in charge of me again.; That sounds so insurmountable though. How would you even start?; I don't know, but I I've gotta do something about this. There's gotta be a way I can... [stops shaking and comes to a realization. He turns to see Craig and smiles. Craig smiles back] Thank you, Craig. [turns around and thinks] I've got it. People aren't focused on the right thing. I know what I should do.; All right everyone, listen up. Tonight, one of our students has put together a song about a very important issue. It's a song about how there are certain times to not be on your phone. I hope you all listen carefully. [applause as Tweek sits at the piano and begins to play wonderfully. Craig appears on stage and begins to sing]; People are dying. The fault is our own.
 You can do lots of damage when you're on your phone.
 We all have to agree to change it somehow.
 Let's all make a pledge to end it right now.; Put it down. Don't be on your phone while being President.
 Put it down. You might do something dumb and cause an accident.; [scattered around town] Let's all agree, here today, that if we're leader of the U.S.A.; We'll put it down; If at any point today you're being a President, put down your mobile device.; Put it down.; If I'm on the phone, I will not get behind the... desk of an oval office.; Put it down.; I'll take the pledge!; I'll take the pledge.; And I'll take the pledge.; No one cares.; What's that? I was just elected President? Well then, goodbye!; Put it down if you're President today.; If you find yourself being President today.; Ah ah ah, ah a-aaah.; Hey, Brian, look! I was just elected President.; That's great, Nancy. Now put down your phone.; Right.; Ah ah ah, ah a-aaah, aaah. Put it down.; [interrupts with his own rap. He's in a graffiti-ridden alley]
 Give a standing ovation for suicide in our nation
 Or I will rip my own guts out without one hesitation [simulates that act. Next, he's in his living room]
 Dedication, that's what it's taken to awaken people to care [next, he stands next to Heidi outside a house]
 And yet my future's so hazy, my girlfriend's makin' me crazy
 But still I'm workin' so hard. You know, just tryin' to hold on, [next, he's in a casket]
 'Cause I know that you don't miss me so much if I was gone. [next, he's on stage with the other kids]
 And all the voices start solo, but every day I hear them grow.
 Sayiin' ""Eric, don't do it! Don't do it! Noooo (noooo, noooo)""; [A sign language interpreter appears in a small window at upper right of the screen to sign for the deaf. Craig and Tweek are holding hands]
 Put it down. Don't be on your phone while being president.
 Put it down. You might do something dumb and cause an accident.
 We all agree, here today, that if we're leader of the U.S.A.
 We'll put it down [the parents and the interpreter fade out. Craig and Tweek look at each other, smiling]; Put it down. [the choir fades out, leaving only Craig and Tweek]; [emerges from the choir and runs up to Craig and Tweek] I'm not gonna do it, you guys! It worked! I'm not gonna do it!"

This is a violation of our human rights! [stops in front of Stan and Kyle]; What the hell is going on?; You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday!; They what??; [runs up between Stan, Kyle, and Cartman] They can't do this! We made plans! [runs off]; Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated!; [returns] You can't take away a day off! We're just innocent children!; Dude, what asshole would take away a holiday?; My name is Peter Galtman. I am the head of the school calendar committee. [the people he's addressing are the parents and faculty of South Park Elementary] I've decided that school will not celebrate Columbus Day this year. I realize this is a hot-button issue for many families, but one parent in particular has really swayed my opinion with his passion. Mr. Randy Marsh. Mr. Marsh pointed out to me the hypocrisy of glorifying a genocidal murderer, and Mr. Marsh is right now also working on having the Columbus statue taken down in Canyon City.; [runs up to the statue] Come on, everybody! Let's take this fuckin' thing down! [kicks it and punches it] Yeah, yehah! [punches it some more, with no effect] Take it down! Columbus was a mass murderer! [people gather to watch as Randy climbs up to the statue's head] Tear it down! Tear it down! Yeah! [grunts as he tries to take it apart] Hey, it's not working. [tugs at the head and grunts] We almost got it, guys! Come on, throw the rope, Stan! [a rope flies up towards him, with noose ready to go. He catches it and wraps it around the head] Good, that's good! Hit the gas, Nelson! [Peter Nelson pulls away with the rope tied to his car] We got it, everybody! To hell with you, Columbus! You guh-whoa! Whoa! [the statue topples to the right and falls apart. Randy falls with it, but isn't hurt]; Hey dude.; Dude! Did you know it's your dad did who's getting the school to cancel Columbus Day?; Yeah. Dude, I don't know what's going on. He's really serious about this.; Well, you've gotta do something. If you get him to back down, maybe the school will reconsider.; I can't get him to back down.; Stan, I have to deal with my mom doing shit like this all the time, but she's never tried to take away a holiday. I'm your best friend, but I can't have your back when the guys find out about this.; I'll try, okay. [glances up for a moment] Ok-I, I gotta go. [Randy walks up with his laptop and phone and sits next to Stan]; Okay, Stan, you got your phone? I need to call everyone on this list. They all live in the same city.; Dad, listen: you need to ease off a little here.; Stan, it's not right that people celebrate a man who wiped out millions of people for his own glory! [puts his phone up to his right ear] Let's go! [places his first call] Hello? Is this uh [checks his laptop screen] Howard Peterson? You live in Columbus, Ohio, is that correct? Yeah? You racist piece of shit. You heard me. You're an intolerant pig. Oh, you're not? You just choose to live in a city named for ethnic cleansing. No, fuck you! Rename your city, asshole! Hello? [evidently, the recipient hung up] Okay, next one, come on. Get calling, Stan!; Dad, come on. We all get your point, but don't you think you're overdoing it?; You have to overdo it in today's society Stan. You can't be nuanced and subtle anymore or else critics go ""Wow, what was the point of that?"" [places the next calls] Hi, Francis Melman? Hey, how are you, you fuckin' racist?; [the camera zooms out to include him] Christopher Columbus. Explorer, pioneer. Is he someone who should be appreciated, or was he just a douche? For years, Columbus Circle has been a landmark and photogenic intersection in New York City. So it came as a surprise when someone defecated on the statue earlier today. I'm joined now by the man who did the actual defecating, Mr. Randy Marsh of South Park, Colorado. [walks up to Randy, who's wearing an ""I poop on New York"" T-shirt, ""poop on"" replaced by a small picture of him pooping on ""New York""]; Good evening.; Mr. Marsh, you took a dump on a beloved statue that's been an icon here in the city for years. What was your reasoning?; Well, I just have a problem with the racist people of this city. Yeehaw, [gets into a hick, redneck accent] I'm from New York! I drive around a big circle n' celebrates a guy who murdered Native Americans! Shoowee!; So you're doing this because of indigenous peoples and their feelings.; I don't care if people get indigenous, I'll crap all over their statues! I'm the one who's indigenous that this landmark even exists!; Aah, aaah, bah, back to you, Tom.; It ain't right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away your one day off in October like you're a piece of trash!; [shows up at table with his lunch] Hey guys. [takes a seat between Token and Jimmy]; Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan!; Look, I tried talking to him, alright? He's just really against all the things Columbus did.; Does anyone know what Columbus actually did?; Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters.; No! No, wait guys. Maybe that's it. When I'm dealing with my mom, sometimes it works to be on her side for a minute. Maybe we should find out all the things people find offensive about Columbus and-; And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle.; I'll just look up Columbus, offensive, inflammatory-; Yeah, this is sweet. It's like that movie where the dude pretended to be on the monsters' side? You know, with the guy and the chick that had the wife beater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them? [Kyle checks the search results]; I love that movie.; Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?; Nnnothing.; Dang it! There's nothing?; Stan, can I talk to you for a minute? [leaves the table, and Stan follows]; [now out of the loop] What? What? What the hell was that?; Hey Dad?; Not now, Stan. I'm working on a proposal to change British Columbia to just British.; But Dad, Kyle found a picture on Instagram. [shows Randy the pictures] It pretty much looks like you dressed as Columbus at a Halloween party. [Randy notices the picture, now shown close up]; Where did you get that?; If you hate Columbus so much, why did you dress like him?; Look, that was a long time ago, okay? It's just a dumb Halloween costume.; Yeah but, [goes through the pictures he pulled off Instagram] here's you dressed as Columbus at a formal dinner, and here's you dressed as Columbus at a football game, and you as Columbus on St. Patrick's Day...; Look, I was younger! We were all... younger. It was another time. You have to understand, it was 2013. Everyone was stoked on Columbus back then.; Yeah, but Dad, you seem to be really stoked on Columbus.; If you guys found those pictures online, it's only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won't care about what I do now. They'll just see me as a thoughtless, indigenous son of a bitch.; Randy, do you mind cleaning out the garage like I asked?; [moping] What's the point, Sharon? Soon they're gonna be coming after me.; Ach. [turns around and walks away]; [a series of faces appear on tv, and Randy is interested] Hey, you! That's right, you! Wouldn't you like to know the story of you? What makes you you? DNAandMe is a genetic service that can help you find out exactly who your ancestors were. You might be surprised.; [at Santa Monica Beach, stops] I thought I was just a standard white guy, but DNAandMe showed that I'm actually 4.2% Cherokee Indian.; [doing curls] Turns out I'm not totally white. I'm also part Northern Asian and even some Kurdish. I'm a victim of oppression. [smiles]; [seated at his desk] I used to get in trouble for always using the N word. But with DNAandMe I found out that I'm 2.1% black.; [walks by] 'Morning, Steve?; Sup, nigga? [smiles]; The test is easy. [a woman is shown swabbing her mouth for a DNA sample and putting it into a cuvette, then sealing that cuvette] Simply swab the inside of your mouth and send it into our lab.; [behind the wheel] People made fun of me for being French. DNAandMe showed I was 8% Navajo. Nobody's makin' fun of me now, or my people, who are victims.; I'm 13% victim.; I'm 21% victim.; Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you. DNAandMe. Are you in?; Hell fucking yes I'm in.; Alright, everyone's here. Let's do this. [in the room with him is a Native American (Bill), whom he walks up to. He opens a desk drawer and pulls out some money] Here you go, just like I said. A hundred dollars cash. No questions asked. Are we good? [Bill just looks him over] Good. No talking. Perfect. Okay, let's get this over with. [pulls Bill's face towards his own and gives him a long, passionate French kiss. Bill gets more and more surprised the longer the kiss continues. Randy suddenly stops the kiss] Thank you. Do not talk of this to anyone. [Bill just turns to watch him leave]; All right, everybody. Hey, thanks for comin'. If uh-I can have your attention, please? I think we're ready to get started.; [holding a DNAandMe kit] Ahah, Mr. Marsh, you know, none of this was really necessary. For DNAandMe testing you can just swab the inside of your mouth yourself and send it in the mail.; Yeah, I know, but I just, I was really excited, wanted everyone to witness my test.; Well, to each their own I suppose. [opens the kit and pulls out a swab] All right, open wide. [Randy opens up and hums as the DNAandMe doctor moves the swab around the inside of his cheek. A shot of the Tuckers and Nelson eating hors d'oeuvres. The doctor takes the swab and puts it back in the kit] Okay, I'll get this back to the lab and get the results to you as quickly as possible.; Okay, great. I'm very interested to see [begins speaking more slowly] what those results have to say.; [answers the phone] Galtman residence.; Listen to me carefully. The man who convinced you to cancel Columbus Day is a fraud.; Who is this?; You will go online and search Instagram for images of Randy Marsh.; I most certainly will not!; Randy Marsh is a hypocrite and a fake. You will be taken down with him when he is exposed! [a shot of the boys' restroom at school. Kenny is the one who's masking his voice as Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look on]; What's he saying?; (Shhh! Don't interrupt!) [masked voice again] We know where you live and we know how to make you suffer!; Now you listen here, Mr. Man! The Galtmans don't believe in social media or the Internet! It's all fake news!; Fake news.; [masked voice] Then speak with Marsh yourself! The truth is out there! [hangs up] (Well, I don't know if that worked.); Hm. [suspicion aroused] Sounds like maybe the Galtmans need to check out Randy Marsh.; Shelly! We've got an emergency! We're getting rid of all the Columbus stuff in this house! Any Columbus costumes? Columbus pictures? They all gotta go!; I don't give a shit about Columbus.; Sharon! Peter Galtman called! He sounds suspicious! We've gotta get rid of all our Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups! Where are they?!; YOUR Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups are in that cupboard.; Shot, shot glasses, coffee cups, towels, plates. What about the Columbus figurine salt and pepper shakers?; I don't know where YOU put them, Randy.; [walks from the cupboard to the sink] Sharon, do you know what they'll do to us when they find out how we were so stoked on Columbus??; YOU were stoked on Columbus, Randy. Not me.; Oho, really?! Did you forget our wedding?! That's you, right there! [shows her the wedding picture. She's in a traditional wedding dress while Randy is dressed as Columbus] Standing there with a big smile on your face! You didn't say anything about it being insensitive then, did you?!; I actually was a little upset that you dressed up as Columbus for our wedding, but I decided-; [moves from her right side to her left] Oh, NOW! You say that NOW 'cause everyone's freakin' out, but you were right there going along with it! [turns around and walks away, but turns around again] They're gonna be coming after you too, Sharon! So you can just wipe that indigenous look off your face! [the doorbell rings and Sharon's eyebrows rise up. Randy perks up] Oh! That could be my DNA results! Here, take this stuff out back! [drops it all next to Sharon and runs to the front door, only to find Bill at the door with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. Randy looks him over, and Bill gives him the bouquet] Oh... nooo, nonononono.; I've never felt so alive until now.; Thank you. Lo-lovely flowers. Thank, thank you. [shuts the door on the bouquet, which is crushed and falls apart]; [answers the phone] Galtman residence.; [masked voice] Listen carefully if you want to live. You will make this Monday a school holiday.; I spoke with Mr. Marsh and he denied any wrongdoing.; [talking from the boys' bathroom at school] Of course he did! That's what liars do!; I don't think you're being intimidating enough.; Yeah, get meaner, Kenny.; Meaner like now, dude?; I don't know, like, like uh, maybe say-; Just talk about cutting off his dick or something.; [to Galtman] We're gonna cut off your dick!; No dude, that's too far.; Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick.; Just give me the phone! Hello!; What?; Randy Marsh is about to pay for what he's done! [shown on the phone] Protect him and you will pay too! Time is running out! [hangs up] Jesus!; Sharon, have you seen my Columbus staff and orb?; I have not. [Randy goes to the closet and start rifling through it]; Sharon, Galtman called again. Somebody's out there trying to get me in trouble!; Randy, why don't you just admit to people that maybe you were somewhat overly excited about Columbus in the past?; Everyone was excited about Columbus! For some reason people are just pointing fingers at me! Just because he's suddenly not cool now doesn't mean I'm gonna be the effin' scapegoat! [leaves the room and closes the door]; I've gotta burn this stuff! [opens the door and sees Bill waiting for him with a drum and stick] Oh Goddamnit!; I wrote you a song to express my feelings for you.; Will you get out of here?!; [bangs on the drum and chants, then] And then he kissed me.; [hushed] I didn't kiss you 'cause I liked you!; [ignores him, bangs on the drum and chants, then] And then he kissed me.; Okay, okay; [bangs on the drum and chants, then] And the sun began to shine.; That's it! Get off my property! [turns him around and shoves him towards the sidewalk]; Randy, I cannot quit you.; Get off my land, you piece of shit! [kicks him to the curb]; Uuugh! [they both look around. Randy sees a jogger across the street with his phone]; Don't post that. [a few seconds pass] Do not. Post that. [the jogger takes off. Randy drops the staff and orb, and gives chase] Shit!; Guys, what are you going?; It's over, Eric. We have to come to school on Monday. Just face it.; I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way-; Dude, there's nothing we can do, all right?; Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said ""Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!""; Eric, just l-let it go.; And when Columbus sailed to distant places only to find people already there who said ""No! Stay off our land! We want our kids to have to go to skewl!"", he said ""No! It's just one day in October! They need a break!"" 
 
You guys can all give up, but I'm not.
 Because in 1492, Columbus got us all a day off skewl.
 With just three ships he sailed over so we could have some me time in October.
 And yes, millions were slaughtered and throats were cut
 But if we don't get that day off of school, then... for what?; Come on, guys. [stands up on the merry-go-round] There's something else we can try.; [excited] Sharon, good news!; What??; The people from the DNA test called. They're on their way over. You wanna come down?; I'm doing something.; You sure? These results could be really interesting. [Sharon stays quiet, so he heads downstairs]; Oh Goddammit, what the hell do you want?; I want you to stop running from yourself. We could be so happy. [the doorbell rings]; Crap, it's them! [to the front door] Just a second, be right there. Thanks! [turns around and shoves Bill towards the back door] Get over here! I don't have any feelings for you. Do you understand?!; But Randy, what about the-; [shoves him out the back door] NO! No buts! There is nothing here! I'm not in love with you! Got it?!; Yes. Yes, I understand.; Good! Now leave! [goes to the front door, and lets the DNAandMe folks in] Hi, sorry. You guys have my results?; Well, Mr. Marsh, we came because there was an irregularity with your test.; Well what? You found something there you didn't expect to find? What is it?; Well it's just a little too odd. We need to do the test again.; Do it again? That's not fair.; Mr. Marsh, please. If we could have one more sample. We want to be absolutely sure of what we found.; Agh-uh oh, okay, no problem. [begins to back up] Give me, give me one sec. I'll be right back. [turns and runs to the back door, opens it, and runs out] Wait! [looks to his left] Wait! [runs up to the Native American and kisses him in the mouth again, and just as before, stops and leaves, this time to go back inside and to the living room] Okay! Okay, all set. Let's do this. Aaaaa-; Mr. Marsh, we were hoping to do a more precise test. It's better for harder cases like this, but... it is an anal swab this time. [prepares the kit]; An anal swab? Give me tuh, three minutes. [backs up and runs out the back door again, looking for the Native American.] Hey, where'd you go? [the doctor walks up behind him and puts his right hand on Randy's shoulder]; Mr. Marsh, we're in a bit of a hurry, if you don't mind. [pulls him back inside]; Oh, aw shit. [the assistant closes the door]; [wearing a horse head mask] All right, it's clear. Bring him in. [Stan, wearing a pig head mask, and Kyle, wearing a rabbit head mask, pull Mr. Galtman inside]; [wearing a pigeon head mask, using his Mysterion voice] Move your ass, Galtman!; This is a violation of my rights.; Just shut up, and watch what someone posted on their Instagram!; I most certainly will not! If you want me to look at the Internet, I will die first. It's fake news!; [as Stan puts a tape into the VCR] That's why we had it transferred to VHS.; Oh, VHS is fine.; Take off his blindfold. [Kyle does so. Stan presses play, and the scene of Randy kicking the Native American to the curb is shown]; Hmmm...; Oh, Mr. Marsh.; Whoa, ha-hay. [turns around] How are you? [smiles nervously]; Good. Wha-what are you up to?; Chillin', chillin'.; Well, uhhh, we did get your DNA results back this morning. Would you like to go over them?; Oh, you did? Oh, great. Sure, why not? Uh, I'm here. Huh let's uh, let's do that.; N'all right Mr. Marsh, here's your DNAandMe portfolio. [starts the presentation] This shows that we actually found a mix of a few things in you regional ancestry.; [jumps up and stands] Really? Like Native American? Like a, like a little bit?; Nno, we didn't find any trace of any Native American DNA in your test.; Nnnuts! [sits down]; But as you can see here [click], we found that you are about 43% Northern European, 37% Mediterranean, and 18% Southwest Asian. In fact, your genetic profile most closely matches [clicks] your standard Caucasian British person.; [sighing] Awww.; And, you might be interested to know that you're actually 2.8% Neanderthal, which is fairly high.; Neander-thal? What the hell is that about?; Well, the Neanderthals were actually a species that was wiped out by Homo sapiens.; Wiped out? All of my people?; Yes, but you see, because of some cross-breeding, some people like you still possess Neanderthal DNA. Isn't that interesting?; Cross-breeding? You mean rape. You're telling me that my ancestors were raped, and then eradicated by you? You maniacs! [kicks the chair out of the way] The earth wasn't big enough for Neanderthals, so your ancestors just got rid of them, huh?! Well TO HELL WITH ALL OF YOU!! [knocks over a tool cart and leaves]; Well well, Mr. Marsh. I'd like to have a word, please.; [walks up to him and punches him out with one blow] You find this funny, Galtman!; What'd I do?; Nobody had the guts to tell me what happened to my people, huh? Get the hell out of here! [opens the front door and Bill is back]; I brought my parents over so you could meet them.; Waww God!; Don't worry. My parents are very okay and cool with us.; Who the hell is that?; Yeah, sure! Everyone gang up on the Neanderthal! Isn't it funny!; Randy, you must face who you are. Stop pretending, Randy. For once, just allow yourself to feel.; [moves away from the others] You're right. [Galtman stands up and they all look at Randy again] You're right. It's only now, when everyone is being so indigenous to me, that I realized... how indigenous I've been acting all along. I thought being a victim would solve all my problems. But being a victim has a down side too. [walks up to Galtman] Mr. Galtman, I haven't been honest. It's time for us all... to be honest.; What is a holiday? It's a day off work, yes. A day off school. But holidays are also meant to be a time to reflect. Today, I'm happy to announce that the school calendar committee is reinstating the day off. [the kids cheer] But instead of glorifying anyone, Let us make it a holiday about the negative feelings that we all sometimes feel. Say what we're really thinking so we can move on. And so, the second Monday in October will still be a holiday, but instead of Columbus Day, it will be for ripping on each other and tearing each other down. And we will call it Indigenous Peoples Day. For perhaps if we all do it at the same time, we won't be so indigenous the rest of the year. And since this is the second Monday of October, let's all embrace the new meaning of the holiday starting right now.; Do you even know what indigenous means, you freakin' idiot?!; That's the spirit, Dave. Come on, everybody, let's just all be totally indigenous. Come on!; Who the hell let this guy talk to the school council?; Good one Kurt. Your wife's a whore. Come on, everyone! Indigenous People's Day! Let's go for it!; Shut up and get off the podium! [people begin to leave]; Okay, I will in a second, fatso. All right, who else? Come on! Get it out of your system! Happy Indigenous People's Day, everyone. Suck my asshole!"

[He zips around town, startling people here and there. Two boys playing basketball almost lose it when he zips by them] And I am very... [stops] f-f-fast. [General Medical Center, day] When I was born, my parents knew I was different.; [handing baby Jimmy to his parents] I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Valmer, your newborn son will never be able to walk. But he will be extremely good at comedy. [Sarah cries as she uncovers his face]; [already with a mic in his hand] Wow! What a teh-t-teh-terrific audience. [Sarah sobs some more]; [voice over] As I got older, my powers only increased.; [on stage] What do you call cheese that isn't yours?; AAAAHHHH Help! [Jimmy zips away and returns moments later with a pickpocket tied up next to him]; Nacho cheese. [gets a round of applause]; [voice over] And now I look for others like me to fight crime as part of a superhero team. I am... Fas... Fastpass! [shown to be auditioning for a role in a superhero team headed by... The Coon. The current team members - Tupperware (Token), Mosquito (Clyde), The Coon (Cartman), Toolshed (Stan), Human Kite (Kyle), and Mysterion (Kenny) - clap approvingly]; [The Coon] Okay, okay, thank you, Fastpass. What do you guys think?; We definitely don't have anyone with superhuman speed in our franchise.; Fastpass, what makes you feel... qualified to be part of our cinematic universe?; Well, besides being super f-f-fa-fast, I also have a good attitude, and flexibility with my schedule on weekends.; Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money.; Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito.; Bzzz oh boy, I get my own origin movie, bzzz?; That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole.; Whoawhoa wait, how come we gotta start off with a Netflix series? Can't we just go right into movies?; Netflix is starving for new shows right now, Toolshed. They will literally buy anything people pitch them. We need to strike while the iron's hot. Later in Phase 3 we can finally get to Civil War, where we will all- [the Coon alarm goes off and the boys look around]; What is it?; Incoming Face Time call from Super Craig. [the boys leave their seats and gather around the monitor]; Onscreen!; You guys, we have a big problem.; What is it, Super Craig?; Somebody's messing with our Facebook page. They're spreading all these lies, saying we like, burn the American flag and pee in each other's mouths.; Spreading lies how?; Take a look. [holds up a picture of a mysterious boy and the Coon and Friends Facebook page] Someone is systematically targeting our Facebook followers and feeding them misinformation.; Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way?; [opens the bedroom door to check in] Butters, you're not looking at boobies again, are you?; No Dad, I'm not looking at boobies. [Stephen closes the door and Butters waits a few second before cackling again] Waahahahahaha!; Butters?!; Oh, hey fellas.; Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise?; Uuuuuuummm, nope. [turns around and walks off, the others wait a second or two before catching up]; Butters? Butters!; [turns around] Yes, fellas?; Dude, listen. We don't have time for this. Right now, Netflix is buying any show that people pitch them. We have a real shot at starting our franchise, and you are a part of that franchise plan, okay? We have movies planned for the bad guy.; You mean like Suicide Squad?; Yes!; [in Stan's face] Suicide Squad sucked! [turns around and walks off again]; Butters! Butters! You can't just make stuff up about us! [Butters turns around again] People are thinking it's true!; Look fellas, you have a right to be on facebook and I have a right to be on facebook. And sometimes that's going to cause a little... [makes a fist and smirks] CHAOS. [looks mischievous and gets slick] Gotta get to classss.; Dude, what a dick!; If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys.; Thanks for coming, everyone. I know you are all concerned as Sarah and I are about what's happening to our children.; I just... can't believe that children in our town are dressing up in hero costumes and peeing in each other's mouths.; And who are these kids? Does anyone know? They're wearing capes and forcing objects into their own rectal cavities? Why?; We [referring to himself and Linda] were shocked to read that a young African-American boy is wearing Tupperware and defecating on girls while they sleep. What if those kids are hanging out with our kids?; You know what I think the problem is? Facebook.; Facebook? How so?; Well, look, we all know there's a lot of mixing of truth and fiction that's been on Facebook lately, and children lack the cognitive ability to determine what's true and what isn't on Facebook. That's why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes, eating poop, and having sex with antelopes in our town.; Maybe we need to get our kids off of Facebook.; That'll never happen. You know what I say we do? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg to come and talk to us all about our concerns in this community.; Do you really think he'd come?; Why not give it a try? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg here and see what he has to say? I'm sure he's a reasonable person. [takes a sip]; [as Professor Chaos] Who are you?! What do you want?!; I'm here about the job? [points to the flyer]; Oh. Are you Adam? Well, come on in. [Adam walks in with Butters and Butters closes the door. Butters gives him a tour of the place] You're making a smart career choice, Adam. You see, what we do here is utilize Facebook not only to spread chaos, but to actually profit from it. You'll find the hours very reasonable and I'm working on getting full health and dental for all employees. [stops and gets a uniform off the shelves for Adam] Here's your company uniform. You see, what I've done, Adam, is build a completely self-sustaining Chaos machine [Adam exits the boys room as Chaos #28] - You look fantastic - doing nothing more than what Facebook was designed to do. I make money from Facebook for my fake content in order to pay Facebook to promote my fake stories. And thusly we're growing bigger every day. Everyone, can I have your attention please? [the other workers look towards them] We have a new agent in Chaos. Please welcome Adam Borque. [the others clap for him] Here you go. You can take this workstation, Adam. Just start writing horrible things about people and presenting it as reality on Facebook. Alright! Don't forget we have a Chaos quota, gang! Let's really fuck shit up! [the workers resume their work]; Uh, alright, can everyone hear me in the back? Hm'kay, we're gonna get started here. I know you all have a lot of questions, so without further ado, let me introduce Mark Zuckerberg. [Zuckerberg walks up] Thanks for coming, Mr. Zuckerberg.; [in a stilted manner. He speaks like this throughout the episode] Thank you. It is a great honor to be here amongst all of you. [immediately you can see his lips don't match his words]; For those of you who don't know uh, could you tell us who you are?; I am the founder and chairman of Facebook. But I also have a shtoile that is completely unblockable.; Okay, we'll let him speak and then we'll uh open the floor to some questions if there's time, thank you.; Thank you, right? [Mr. Mackey walks off] Alright, everyone here wants to see my shtoile. But first, what I'll need is a volunteer. Yes, you sir.; Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook has become a tool for some to disrupt our country and our community.; You say these things like they are my fault, and yet they are not.; Well, you did create a platform with a monetary incentive for people to spread misinformation?; Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I see you're trying to use your shtoile over mine. Now, you try to block me. [assumes a fighting stance, puts his left palm out as far as it can go, and makes some odd sounds] Now you've learned that you cannot block me, yehhhs? [a woman raises her arm] Yes, what is your question?; [stands up] How are we supposed to keep our kids-? [he interrups her with some more fighting stances and odd sounds, and she sits down]; Wilson Aubrey?; Yeah.; It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram?; Because you victimize innocent people and poop in little girls' mouths.; That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein.; Facebook says it's true.; But it's NOT true.; But Facebook says it's true.; [gets in his face] Okay, but it's NOT true, and you need to have your own fucking brain and decide shit for yourself!; AAAAH! [shuts the door on Cartman, who's taken aback. Cartman turns around and leaves the house, and the other Coon Friends follow]; God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise!; It's so unfair.; Come on, fellas. Wu-we can't let Butters win.; Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now.; Yeah, nobody believes in us.; W-we believe in each other, don't we? [the others look at him] Who cares what everyone else thinks? I joined this franchise because I believe that it can make a lot of money. And being a superhero means you keep believing in that money, no matter how hard things get!; Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself!; Coon, everybody hates us.; Maybe so, but we know who we are! We are Coon Friends because we care about each other. Because we have each other's back! And when things look their darkest, these heroes will stand together! [Heidi walks up behind him] And we'll-!; Hey babe, what's up? [Cartman stands still a moment, then deflates. Several seconds later he sighs heavily a couple of times, closes his eyes, sniffle and groans, and puts his right hand over his right eye. He's at a loss for words as Heidi's smile fades] What are you up to?; [soft voice] Nothing, just fucking wearing sweet costumes and talking about fighting evil, is that okay?; I just- I thought we were meeting at the park. You didn't text or anything.; [soft voice, to himself] Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me right now?; Sorry! I won't interrupt! [turns around and walks off, Cartman watches her walk off with a concerned look on his face, then turns back to the other Coon Friends and continues his speech]; Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything!; I swear, that was the worst public speaker I've ever seen. What was Mark Zuckerberg's point?; I don't even understand what that was about.; Guess nobody realized that Mark Zuckerberg was such a penis.; What the hell?; It's Mark Zuckerberg.; I know who it is! [to Zuckerberg] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!; I was invited here by people.; We invited you to come speak to our community about our problems!; [assumes a fighting stance] Ah, I see what you did there. Trying to block me, riiight? I'm tired of eating chips. What else is there? [makes his way to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator]; Hey! Get out of our fridge!; Ha ha ha, this puny refrigerator could not block me. What makes you think you can?; Now you listen here! I will not-! [Zuckerberg puts up his left arm and holds it out as if creating a force field for blocking]; Ha ha ha ha, you are no match for my shtoile.; So, where are we headed? Perhaps we should get some food.; What, eh. Excuse me, this is our car?!; You call this a car? It wasn't even remotely able to block me. What is this car's shtoile?; Get, get out of here, ya penis.; Ha ha ha ha. You say I am a penis and yet I am not a penis.; Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?; [from home] Uh yes, hello. We have an idea for a show that we think would be great for Netflix.; Okay, great. Would you like a pilot or just go straight to an order of six episodes?; We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three.; Got it. Can you start shooting next month?; Got a show about transsexual dragons here.; Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited.; Okay, sounds great, we'll send you the contracts. Oh, and uh, what's the show about?; It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends.; Coon and Friends? You mean, the kids I just read about in the news who stabbed Jessica Alba?; Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook!; Aw man, here we go.; Yeah, ah, dangit, we've never done this before, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on your show.; Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE!; Well then, you should have those things taken down. It can't be that hard.; It's a lot harder than you think!; L-look, we'd love to approve your show, but you need to get those things cleared up first, okay? Thanks for calling. [hangs up and takes the next call] Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?; What the? Who are you?; I believe that's Mark Zuckerberg.; Hey that's my soup!; [rises into a fighting stance] So, you are trying to block me, huh? That's fine. What's your shtoile?; I don't have a shtoile.; Hey! Get out of my bed!; I was invited here. I am only making use of a bed for sleeping, yehhhs?; We just wanted you to come share your insights on Facebook!; [makes some strange motions and sounds] Oh, my head, my head. [makes more strange motions and sounds] You should have worked with me when you had the chance. Now you lie over there, dead.; Attention employees. Kelly Shmidt has just written her 100th fake blog post that was shared over a thousand times on Facebook. Let's hear it for Kelly! [the staffers clap] Don't forget about those Chaos incentives! You too can benefit from pandemonium. [smiles. Coon and Friends show up and walk through the front doors]; Butters!; Whoa no, it's Coon and Friends! [he and the other staffers hide under their desks]; Oh no!; Calm down, everyone. Stick to your work. I will deal with these trespassers.; We're here to put an end to you, Chaos!; Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Token doesn't poop in girls' mouths!; It's the 21st century, gentlemen! There's nothing illegal about what I'm doing.; Yeah? Nothing illegal about us kicking your ah...ass either.; Actually, that IS illegal. And besides, you can't do anything to me. [whistles. Zuckerberg emerges from the back of the store on the second floor, flips over the balcony, and lands in front of Butters]; Bwaaaaaa! So, this is the Coon and Friends that you have told me about. [to the Coon Friends] I warn you, my fighting shtoile is unsurpassed.; Who the ss-Sam Hell is th-that?; I think that's Mark Zuckerberg.; You want to get to Butters, riiight? You're gonna have to get through me, huuuh?!; Dude, this kid is deliberately lying about us on your platform for no other reason than to cause harm! Why are you protecting him?!; Simple. He paid me $17.23.; It's the Facebook Safeguard program. Just $17 monthly gets you personal protection from Mark Zuckerberg.; Come on! What's your shtoile?; Alright, alright, everyone calm down! I can't hear over all of you. [the crowd quiets down]; You have to do something! This guy's goin' around acting like everyone's stuff is his!; I'm sick of getting out of the shower to find Mark Zuckerberg sitting on my toilet!; Zuckerberg ate everything in our freezer and then helped himself to my wife's lubricant! [the crowd begins to clamor again]; Alright, everyone, I just want to know one thing. Who invited him here? [the crowd falls silent] Come on. Who invited Mark Zuckerberg to town in the first place? [the folks hang their head in shame]; We did. [other townsmen say the same thing]; Huh? What's that?; We invited Mark Zuckerberg to town.; Uh huh, that's what I thought. You all brought Mark Zuckerberg into your lives and now you want the police to shoot him.; Please, you don't understand! He-h he's such a penis!; Yeah, and I'm pretty sure his voice is dubbed and he does all his own sound effects.; Well that doesn't mean he's done anything illegal. Now, the police will help deal with Mark Zuckerberg, but we aren't going to shoot him.; Awwwwww!; I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. You all should've thought harder about this before letting him into your lives.; When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix.; Zuckerberg is the key. He's the only person who can shut down Facebook.; How are we gonna get him to do that?; We're gonna beat him at his own game.; We got the west entrance to town secure. How are you guys doing out east?; Here he comes... [looks left and walks towards the roadblock. Zuckerberg walks towards town slowly]; Okay, Mr. Zuckerberg, that's gonna have to be it. Can't let you into town.; So, you think you can block me.; Look, people don't want you here, okay? This is a quiet little town and-; Ha ha ha! You cannot block me!; But there's plenty of other places you could go, sir. Can you please just- [Zuckerberg strikes some poses and makes some odd sounds] Don't, don't do that, please.; [continues making strange sounds and begins moving through the roadblock] My brain, my brain. [more strange sounds]; He walked though.; [more strange sounds] Oh my car, my car. [more strange sounds and motions] Oh my God it's Mark Zuckerberg. [more strange sounds and motions] Oh my God how'd he do that? [more strange sounds and motions. Jimmy zooms across the street behind him. He turns around, and Jimmy passes by three more times behind him]; What's the matter? Too f-fast for ya?; Ha ha ha, you saw me walk right through the police barricade and yet you think you can block me, riiight? Go ahead and try. [Jimmy walks up to him and between his legs to the other side. Both of them are making their own sound effects]; [jumps into view] Now, Zuckerberg! Let me see you block my shtoile!; Ha ha ha ha ha! [they both make their own sound effects and move around]; [appeaers and approaches Zuckerberg] Bwa! Dadadadadadadada bam! [punches him in the groin]; Oh... [falls over his his hands over his privates. The other Coon Friends rush in and kick him on all sides] Hagh. Ow. I have never witness this shtoile before.; Hey look! The freaky costume kids are getting Zuckerberg! Get him, kids!; Poop in his mouth!; [Zuckerberg stands up and throws them all off. He then takes on Jimmy, Kyle, and Token individually and defeats them] Rwaaaar!; [hitting the ground] Aaaah!; Ha ha ha, you tried to match my shtoile and failed!; [walks into view] Oho, it is over! My friends are all beaten! Why?! They were just children! [walks up to Token] This one, simply protesting for black lives! [walks up to Jimmy] And this child tryin' to speak out for handicapped people!; Wha- Why, Mark Zuckerberg??; And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews!; What what what what are you talking about?; [whispers triumphantly] Ever heard of Facebook Live? [Mark doesn't follow, but Craig is shown in an alley recording this encounter onto his laptop. He waves at Cartman. Cartman turns toward the camera] We are just kids trying to have our voices heard for black, handicapped, and Jewish rights, cut down in our prime by Mark Zuckerberg.; But, but hold on, that, that's not true.; [triumphantly turns around] Facebook says it's true.; Noooooooo! [quickly checks his phone]; Huh? Hey. What? Huh?; What's goin' on? Hey everyone, keep working!; We can't.; Something's wrong with Facebook.; It's gone. Like, somebody shut it down.; What are you talking about? [a door is heard shut]; It's over, Chaos! [shown with the other Coon Friends] We forced your little toady to shut down his own disorder device!; Curse you, Coon and Friends! This isn't over!; Oh yes it is. [Behind Coon and Friends, Butters' parents enter the abandoned store]; Butters! You're the one who started all this?!; Uh oh.; You think you're just so smart, don't you?! Make me look like a fool, will you?! We'll just see about this!; Wah. No sir, I, ah. No sir, I just ah.; Not so funny now, is it?! Go on! Tell Mr. Putin what you told me!; Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia did. And I really didn't break any rules.; Didn't break any rules?! Good job teaching our children that's all that matters! Just because there's a way to cause chaos in a town, or disrupt an entire country, doesn't mean you go and do it, does it?! If Mark Zuckerberg points a loaded cannon at someone's face, [points at Putin] are you innocent for just lighting the fuse?! Answer me!; Nyet, ser. [""No, sir.""]; No! You don't go around making things up about people either! Unless it's about Mark Zuckerberg, because he deserves it! [walks towards the door] I hope you're both very satisfied with the damage you've caused, because you're both GROUNDED! [leaves and slams the door]; Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV show. All we have to do now is agree on the final draft of the franchise plan. [shown once again, with some changes] You can see that the Super Craig movie now precedes the Coon vs. Super Craig movie, followed by Mysterion's video game. And then we-; How come I have to have the video game? I want a movie too!; You have a movie, Mysterion. You're in the third Coon and Friends United movie [Coon and Friends United 3], after your video game.; Yeah, but he's saying he doesn't ever get his own movie.; Do I get my own movie?; Not everyone gets their own movie!; This franchise plan sucks!; Oh Jesus, here we go again.; No, Wonder Tweek is right. It was better when we started the movies off with the Tupperware prequel.; Dude you can't do a prequel first.; Why not?; 'Cause then it's not a prequel, it's just... first. And besides, Tupperware isn't our strongest character.; Fuck you, it's better than the Human Kite!; He just likes this plan because he gets two movies in Phase 1.; Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet!; You go with the plan! Maybe we'll just... go and do our own franchise!; Yeah!; Yeah!; Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?!; Yeah dude, civil war. Fuck you! [leaves the table and the basement]; Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house!; We'll make WAY more money on OUR franchise! [Token and Tweek leave, then Kenny leaves]; Go ahead! I bet you don't even get halfway through Phase 1 on your franchise, DC Comics! [after Kenny leaves, the door closes. A few seconds of silence follows]; I thought Civil War wasn't supposed to happen until Phase 3.; Shut up, Super Craig."

Yehehehehes.; [hits his snout on the mic again, pics up a guitar, and begins to play it as he sings] I ah thanks... for'm celeb... Marcus's birthday.; What's wrong with him?; Can't you tell?

[Strums] Never meant to cause you any so- [barfs on stage, falls forward onto the ground in front of the stage and dies. Marcus screams]; All right, kids, uh, why don't we head back to the party and cut the cake?; I don't want cake! Who's gonna eat cake at a time like this?! [wails. A paramedic closes the back doors of the ambulance as a police officer stands watch]; Another drug overdose?; [the paramedic, hands the officer two medications] Most likely. Percolate and Oxycontin found wrapped in his cheesecloth.; Prescription drugs, but with no prescription.; You guys know where all these illegal meds are coming from?; Most likely from the prisons. Whenever there's a drug epidemic you can usually trace it back to people who've been... thrown away by society and forgotten about.; [receptionist] Can I help you?; Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa?; [puts her hand over her heart] Oh, how nice of you. All right, arms in the air. [two burly men approach Stan. One, Tony, takes the present and hands it to Vicky, the other, Toby, wands Stan. Vicky opens the package] What's the present?; It's just some Hummels.; More Hummels? Why are senior citizens so infatuated with these little German statues? All right, go on, you got ten minutes. [Tony hands the present back to Stan, who goes on in]; Grandpa?; [looking out the window, turns to see him] Billy! [turns around and wheels towards him] Finally you're here to visit.

[Marvin wheels away to his desk, where he opens the present.]; Awww, Merry Wanderer [The Hummel with yellow umbrella and bowler hat] and Happy Traveler? [The Hummel with bindle and feather in its cap] These Hummels suck!; That's what the guy gave me.; It's okay, Billy. I'm just gonna need you to deliver another one of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows.; Aw, come on, Grandpa. Isn't it enough I come to visit?; You don't understand how it works in here. Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch. You do what she says, or you pay the price.; Oh, please, uh I don't want no trouble. [the three women enter his room] I'm sorry. I'll get better Hummels.; Dude, Stan. Come on, dude, we're gonna go set off fireworks at Kenny's house.; I will. I just gotta do this for my grandpa first.; Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him?; I don't know. It's what he wants. I feel bad for him, all right? I think he's miserable.; He's old. He's supposed to be miserable.; Look, I just gotta make this exchange for him and then we can go. Oh, oh, I think this is her now. [a red fox with blue gloves and mask prances over]; Are you Stan Marsh? It's me, Swiper.; Cool. Do you have the Hummel?; [looks around, then reaches into her tote bag and pulls one out] This is it. Ride Into Christmas, Limited Edition. Now give me the pillow. I have to get to a birthday party.; 'Kay, fine. [makes the exchange, and Swiper shakes the pillow until she's satisfied]; All right, peace. [prances away]; Dude, that's really weird.; Old people love Hummels, dude.; Students, faculty, and staff, today we are facing an epidemic of catastrophic proportions. I know I am not alone in mourning the loss of one of our greatest entertainers, [click. A picture comes up on the projector screen] Chuck E. Cheese. Had we known the personal hell he was going through, perhaps we could've helped. But toooo many were more than eager to supply Chuck E. with the opioids that caused his untimely death. Chuck E. was not the first entertainer to die from this epidemic. Let us not forget Dinkie Dook the Clown [shown with an accordion], dead of a Roxanol overdose at Tommy Schneider's bar mitzvah last March. Shimmer and Shine [two genies], who both collapsed from massive amounts of oxycodone at Nelly Anderson's birthday party. Spider-man, cut down in prime by Demerol, and just recently, Swiper the Fox. dead of multiple opioids found in his crochet pillow. How many more entertainers must we lose before we take action?! It is time to declare war on opioids in our society! [the kids cheer and clap as Stan Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are shocked at what they just heard]; Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!; I don't know, all right?!; You didn't know you were slinging drugs for your grandpa?; It didn't occur to me as a possibility.; Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on!; I had no idea what was going on!; [walks in and goes to the urinal] Hey fellas! [smiles and looks at them, then turns around and drops his pants and briefs, then lifts up his shirt and pees in the urinal] Boy, that Marcus kid is on the warpath, huh? Well, he's really motivated. I mean, screw that kid, but I guess it's good somebody's finally doing something about these goddamn drug dealers. [Butters finishes, flushes the urinal, zips up, and turns towards the other boys and looks at them again, smiling] Well, see ya, fellas. [turns left and walks out. The other boys haven't moved an inch the whole time he was there]; Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in!; No, we don't have to do that! Let me talk to him. I can put a stop to this.; [whispering] Grandpa, what the hell have you gotten me into?!; [whispering] Shhh, quiet. They'll hear you!; There were drugs in the crochet pillow, weren't there?! Do you know people are dying?!; What do you want me to do, Billy? You see Ms. McGullicutty over there? [she's shown tripping a man as he walks to a table with his lunch and chuckling to herself] Whoever has the best Hummel collection is top bitch in this place, and she's got the best. She's ruthless, and she has those old lady farts. You know old lady farts, right? Where they're so loose they don't even acknowledge they happened?; Oh, hello Mr. Marsh. [pfffft]; Oh, Ms. McGullicutty. How are you feeling today?; I'm doing very well. [turns her back to him and farts again] Have they given you Percocet for that knee of yours? [pfffft]; Oh, yeah, here, I I just got it, huh. Here you go. [hands her the Percocet]; Oh, you'd almost think you were trying to keep them from me. [pfffft]; Oh, uh, ma'am? My grandpa actually really needs those drugs. He's in a lot of pain.; Ohhh, and who's this little rascal? [walks around to Stan's chair and looks over his shoulder]; That's my grandson, uh he he's worthless.; How sweet. [pfffft] Hmmm, coming to visit your old poppa in the joint, huh? You love your poppa, don't you? [pfffft. Stan winces] You'd hate to see him suffer even more he already is. [slow, soft pfffft. Stan avoids looking at her and winces again. Now she addresses Marvin] You watch your ass, Marsh, or I'll have you sent to the quiet room. [pfffft. She turns right and walks away, hitting a man with her can on the way out]; What, what is she talking about? What's the quiet room?; I told you, she has all the pull in here. You go against what she says, you end up in solitaire.; No! No, please, uh I didn't do anything!; It's all right, Mr. Standish, you just need a little quiet time.; Uh, I don't even know how to play solitaire. Please! [they lock him up and leave]; I understand that today they are performing Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?; Oh, the kids' party performer. Yeah.; As a concerned member of the public, I wish to be present.; Uh, sorry, children aren't really allowed in autopsies.; Then I shall wait here to learn the coroner's findings.; Toxicology reports show subject had massive amounts of opioids in system at time of death. Now proceeding. [he and his assistant pull the sheet off and the coroner begins to saw the performer's mask off. The officer begins to feel sick. The mask is finally removed, and the officer vomits]; Have these put in the garbage.; What did you find, coroner?; Who is this?; There is an epidemic in our community, sir. Some of us actually care to confront the problem! Now, dammit, what did you find?; Nothing out of the ordinary. The subject died of a simple overdose. We found nothing else except for two Hummmels in the subject's rectal cavity.; Hummels? In his rectal cavity, you say? And you do not find this out of the ordinary?; Not at all. We found Hummels in nearly all the birthday entertainers' anal cavities. It's very common in our overdose victims.; Mmmm, a bit too common, don't you think?; Guys, why does Grandpa have to be in a nursing home? Can't he live with us again?; Stan, Grandpas has a lot of needs that we can't provide him here. He needs professional supervision.; Is that really it? Because I, I just feel like we kind of threw Grandpa away and forgot about him.; Oh really? Do you have any idea how much money we pay to have Grandpa in that place? Your grandpa is stylin'! Can you imagine being able to just sit around all day and not have to do anything but eat and watch TV?; Yeah. I'd probably go crazy and wanna kill myself.; Jesus, Stan! It's not like he's in jail!; Yeah, it's kind of like jail. You should go visit him.; I can't! I'm too busy busting my ass to pay the bills for that place, and to pay for your guitar lessons!; I don't have guitar lessons.; I don't want to go there. It's depressing. Aw you tricked me.; [his phone rings and he answers] Hello?; [at the downtown corner with Butters] Dude! Did you give Butters a crochet pillow to drop off?!; [quickly leaves the table] Dude, I don't have a choice. I have to get the Hummels for my grandpa.; Well, you need to get Hummels without making Butters a drug dealer!; Drug dealer??; All right, all right! I think I know another way.; Hey, we have this week's delivery of medications.; Bring them in. [the delivery man goes outside and motions for a truck driver to back up and dump the medications. The truck backs up and dumps the meds onto the asphalt at the community's entrance, then rolls away. Stan has walked up to the community entrance and watches the truck leave]; Ah!; Hello, Mr. Marsh.; Uh hey, hey Marcus.; I understand you've become quite the Hummel collector lately. What's the... fascination with Hummels?; Nothing. I-look, I, I just really like Hummels, okay? I'm just, I'm really into Hummels.; Ah! I see. So then you should be able to tell me what this Hummel is called!; That, that's uh...; Come on! If you're a Hummel expert, then you should know its name!; That, it's, it's ""Whistling In The Rain.""; Wrong! It's called ""Stormy Weather!"" Do you know where it was found?; No.; It was found deep in the anus of one Chuck E. Cheese, the renowned entertainer beloved by millions! If you know something about the epidemic that is killing artists, you'd better cough it up!; Marcus, trust me. You don't wanna get involved.; I became involved when Chuck E. Cheese collapsed like a rag doll before my very eyes! If you had any involvement, I will bring you down!; Well, it's really great seeing you, Dad. Guess we oughtta hit the road soon.; You finally come to visit and leave after 10 minutes?; Aw Jesus, now we know where Stan gets his guilt trips from!; [appears at Marvin's door] Mmmm [Marvin looks over his shoulder], it seems somebody's been a little naughty lately. [pfffft]; [turns a bit to see her] Oh, Ms. McGullicutty, heh heh. How are you?; [walks over to Marvin's meager Hummel collection] Hrrmm. My, what a lovely Hummel collection you're starting to amass. [sniffs] Almost smells [pfffft]... brand new, doesn't it? [pfft. She turns to face Marvin] Like it was purchased right from the factory. [pfffft] Ooooo! And who are these lovely people? [walks up to Randy and Sharon] Family that came to visit, no doubt? [pfft]; [holding his breath] Yes. Yeah, we love coming here.; Ah, family. I remember when I was a little girl. [pfffft] My brother used to play such tricks on me. [pfft-pfft] Tried to fool me. Tried to get out from his responsibilities. [pfffft]; I'm giving you Hummels. What's it matter where they came from? [Mrs. McGullicutty farts again]; [chuckles] Nooo, [Randy covers his nose] it doesn't matter to me. But it matters to them. [pfffft] The big guys. You see, what they want is more people who are addicted to crochet pillows. [pfffft] Got it? [pfffft. She makes her way towards the door] Nice to meet you fine folks. [pfffft]; Wugh. [whispers to Sharon] We're never visiting here again.; Ohooo, you're dead Butters.; Haw Jeez.; [runs in] Guys! Guys, I need your help.; If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out.; I just talked to my grandpa. There's more at work here than just old people pushing pills.; Stan, we told you we don't wanna be involved.; [stands in front of the TV] The head bitch of the nursing home is gonna take my grandpa down. Maybe my whole family.; [trying to see the game] Get out of the way, dude!; But I know what to do! Whoever has the best Hummels controls the nursing home. We've gotta steal this lady's Hummel collection and give it to my grandpa!; [walks up to Stan] Dude, Stan, even if we wanted to help you, which we don't, there's no way we can sneak into an old folks home, distract all the old people, and take an old lady's Hummels! [turns to the left with a thought and walks off] Oh wait, there totally is a way we could do that.; [catches up] Yeah? What ih, what is it, Cartman.; Dude, we're not getting involved!; Cartman, if you have an idea, please tell me. I need you.; I know how to distract old people.; Haww shit!; Yes?; We're at Mimi Thompson's party. Peppa Pig just collapsed on stage. [it's Mimi's 10th birthday]; Oh my God! Don't let anyone near Peppa Pig until I arrive! [leaves the house. Soon he's at the party] Move aside! Let me through! [reaches the stage and kneels next to Peppa] Aw Peppa. Peppa, can you hear me? [Peppa moans] My name is Marcus Preston. Can you understand me? Where did you get the drugs, Peppa? Was it from Stan Marsh?; [a black man in costume] Yo man, whatchoo talkin' about? Get me a fuckin' ambulance!; [tearing up] Shh, Peppa. Focus. Soon you'll be in heaven jumping in all the puddles you can imagine. But first, you must tell me, where do the Hummels go, Peppa?; All right, let us through. Get away, kids.; Peppa, now! Why Hummels?! You've got to squeal!; Old people. Old people... love... Hummels. [groans a couple more times and dies]; It's okay, she's with Chuck E. Cheese now.; Can I help you?; Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people.; Didn't think we had anyone scheduled tonight. Are you with the Protestant youth group?; Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can.; Fine. Round them up, we got another kids choir!; Come on, let's go. Children's choir in the commons.; [amid groans] Aw dammit. Shit.; Darlin' children are gonna sing for you! Move your asses!; Aw, not again.; All right, seniors. How are we feeling tonight? Our youth group has come to lift your spirits with some songs to take you down memory lane. We hope you can enjoy some nice old-people music. [blows into a pitch pipe to determine a scale to sing in]; I'm... insane in the membrane.; Insane in the membrane.; Insane in the brain; Crazy insane, got no brain.; In the membrane.; Myyyy milkshake brings all the boys; to the yard, and they're like [Butters sticks his finger into his mouth and pops it out] it's better than yours.; Damn right!; [Butters sticks his finger into his mouth and pops it out] it's better than yours.; My hot milkshake. 
 
 And now here's our own take on that oldie, but goodie by Nirvana.; In the cool, cool winter.; Rape me.; In the hot hot summertime.
 Rape me, my friend.; You suck!; Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives!; [gives Cartman the bird] Fuck you!; Fuck you! [picks a different note] 
 
If you; Want to call me baby; Just go ahead now-; Hello, Mr. Marsh!; Marcus.; [turns on the light] I told you I'd bring you down. [quickly takes out his phone and takes a picture]; Marcus, it's not what you think. I'm trying to make things better here. [he and Marcus begin to walk around each other slowly]; Oh, I bet you are! You, your grandpa, ALL the people here, are going to jail! I'm calling the police!; You can put an end to this place, but you won't be stopping the problem. These people are victims too, Marcus. Victims of a way bigger game being played by way bigger people!; [turns his back to Stan] Oh, you're a fine one for speeches! When it comes to saving your own ass!; It's not for me, Marcus. Look, I know you loved Chuck E. Cheese. [Marcus stops dialing] I know you'd do anything to bring down the people who took him from you. [Marcus begins to soften and soon gets emotional] That's why you have to go further, Marcus. Take it to the people who profited from Chuck E.'s addiction.; [turns around, sobbing] He was just a mouse... who wanted to make people happy. [walks up to Stan, and they hug each other]; I know. I know.; No time to search the world around
 When I come around. When I come around.; I come around. 
 
 [the residents begin to leave one by one]; Hey, where are ya'll goin'?; Back to our rooms. You kids are absolutely awful. [pfffft]; [notices her door already open] What the? [pfft] Someone is in my room! [pfffft. She goes in with her two friends]; Whaaaat?! [pfffft]; Billy. What are you doin' here?; [moves to his right] Surprise, Grandpa. [a bag appears where Stan stood just moments ago] I got what you needed.; Heh. [rolls forward] Billy, Mrs. McGullicutty's Hummel collection. You got it for me.; Yeah, Grandpa. Now you can put a stop to all this, right?; Yeah. I just might be able to.; What are you doing, Grandpa?; I told you, Billy. These Hummels hold a special power with old people.; [enters with her friends] You! [pfffft]; [to Stan] Go on, get out of here.; You really thought stealing my Hummels would make you the head bitch in this place?! [pfffft]; Yeah. I think it will. [swings the bag around and gives her a bloody nose]; Aaah! [Marvin swings the bag around and takes out Mrs. McGullicutty's friends, he keeps swinging at them as they escape his room. The other residents look out of their rooms and cheer him on. He swings at Mrs. McGullicutty all the way down the hallway until she stops moving. The boys arrive]; [turns and looks at the boys, and smiles] Now you know how we do shit in the nursing home.; ...That's pretty sweet.; You get your paws off of me, young man! [pfffft]; There there, Ms. McGullicutty. Everything's gonna be all right. [they take her to solitaire]; No! [pfffft] Not solitaire! [pfffft] I won't play it! You can't make me! [pffpffft. Tony and Toby put her inside and lock the door. Stan and Marvin watch from the Senior Cafe]; Congratulations on becoming head bitch, Grandpa.; Thank you, Billy. Now if we could only take down the real douchebags who profit from all this.; Ahhh, don't worry. I have a feeling that's about to happen.; Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Marcus Preston. I have... some questions."

Of course I am.; Stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch.; Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys.; Yeah, and you guys get wasted.; We have some drinks. Come on, all the other guys' wives aren't being bitchy about it.; Sup, witches! [gets into the car]; Alright, Randy's got the JD!; Yep. Who's got the other stuff.; Kevin said he's bringing it. [Randy chuckles, then the other men join in]; [Impatient, yet quiet] Come on, come on... [normal voice] Sweetheart, can we get going, please?; [from her closet] Hang on, babe. Just a couple more things. [tosses out random pieces of clothing]; Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?; [dressed in a black spider suit and orange skirt with bats on it] What do you think?; [urgently] Great, perfect. Let's go to the pumpkin patch.; Yup! Almost ready. [gets up on her chair and pulls out two items from her dresser]; Wha-what?; Okay, spider or the bat?; [getting exasperated] The spider's great.; Really? 'Cause I think I like the bat.; [quietly, from the other side of her bed] Why does she do this every time?; What, babe?; [urgently] I said it's time. Boy, look at the time.; 'Kay, all set.; [leaves the bedroom] 'Kay, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch.; [leaves the bedroom] Okay! Oh! I forgot my glitter lip gloss!

No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy!; Oh, okay. [heads back to the bathroom, and Cartman is dejected. Heidi looks back for a second] Hang on, I gotta pee.

 Jack and Crack Witch Week tonight
 Everybod-; Thanks for taking the kids out tonight, Ms. Cartman. Heidi's been looking forward to it.; Oh yes, my little Eric just loves the pumpkin patch. It's one of his favorite events of the year.; Okay, come on, let's go.; All right, you kids all ready?; [directing his comments at Heidi upstairs] Yup. All set to go to the pumpkin patch!

Happy Witch Week! [falls to the ground face first] Ow. [the other men laugh at him.]; [walks in with a book] Hey, HEY! [the partying stops] You guys wanna see some real witchcraft? [no one replies for a few seconds]; Oooooooooooooo. [the men laugh]; I mean it! I got this spell book last month. Got it in Salem, Massachusetts. They say it's real.; Like real, how?; Like from the Devil himself. You guys wanna try it?; Yeah.; Hey, wait up, babe! [Cartman stops, closes his eyes, and stretches out his hand for Heidi to take when she catches up to him]; [walks by with his pumpkin and his mom] Hey, where you been, Eric?; Oh boy! What a great time that was.; Thanks for coming, kids. [sees Cartman and Heidi approaching] Oh, you just getting here?; Yeah, we are just getting here.; Okay uh, go on in, I suppose. Petting zoo's closed, and I think they stopped the churro machine.; The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed?; Yeah. You can still maybe do the bouncy house.; Come on, babe!; Arkna. Peduum.

Oh, it burns!; Okay, Chip. You might need to ease up on that crack there, buddy. [Chip drops the book and screams, and begins to transform into an actual witch. A broom flies to him and he rides off on it, cackling]; I'll kill you all! Kill you all!; [cackling] You'll all be dead by Halloween! [cackles some more]; Get out! Everyone out!; What do you mean?! I just got here!; There's a witch! [Chip flies in and starts bombing the patch]; Come on, Eric!; No! I missed it! I missed it all! [Heidi pulls him away. Chip sees a boy, plucks him off the ground and carries him away]; Oh. Hey, didn't see you there.; Did you hear anything about what happened last night?; Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened?; Your buddy, Chip Duncan? [holds up her phone, on which there's a news report about it] Apparently, he flew around on a broom, blew things up, and kidnapped some children?; Are you serious?!; You heard nothing about this?! He flew away vowing we'd all be dead by Halloween!; [hands her back the phone and walks off] God, I knew that guy was a fuckin' chode!; Randy, what did you guys do at that party?; [turns around] Nothin'. We were just hangin' out and talkin' and stuff, and then Chip got all weird.; People were hurt!; Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch!; Did any of you guys actually see the witch?; Yeah, it was terrifying. She had a broom and a cackle and everything.; What are we gonna do, guys?; Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around! [next to him, Cartman has an angry glare on his face]; They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that?; No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early.; Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. [the camera begins to focus on Cartman's glare]; We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe.; Yeah, but what are we gonna do?; No, we've got to just hope the police will handle it.; Yeah, right. Like they'll handle anything. [from a nearby table, Heidi peeks past Bebe and smiles at Cartman, waving at him]; Stan's right. This might fall on us. [Cartman waves back, his glare fixed on her]; Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric?; [his concentration is broken] What?; We've got to do something to get rid of her!; Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out.; All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night.; [displeased] Where do you think you're going?; What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys.; [stands up] You can't possibly be considering doing this again!; Why not?; Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don't think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!; Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we're supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus! [turns around and walks out the front door]; Hey Randy.; Sup guys?; You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches.; I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy.; It's like a witch pursuit thingy.; A witch uhhh-; It's a witch chase and shoot 'em up.; Yeah, that's what it is!; Hey, what the hell is this?; [reading the sign] ""Park closed until further notice"". That's bullshit!; Oh my God.; They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing!; Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape.; What are bent pits? [Cartman walks in with some plans]; Hey guys, I think I got it figured out.; You do?; I knew Eric would come up with a plan! [Cartman puts up a drawing of his plan, which involves the boys luring Heidi to her death, burying the body, and celebrating her death with a pizza. He then brings out his retractable pointer and starts pointing]; Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-; Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about?; This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi.; Nobody's talking about getting rid of Heidi!; You guys said you would help me get rid of her!; OF THE WITCH!; Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys!; Then break up with her! You clearly can't stand her! LET THE POOR GIRL GO!; I've tried! It's impossible!; Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?!; You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle! [Kyle just stares angrily at him] Fine. Just leave me to suffer. Next time you want me to kill someone for you, just forget about it! [leaves the room]; Students and parents, I know that you are all concerned about the witch who is preying upon our town, and I wanna speak to you all about how to try and protect yourselves. But first, some gentlemen have asked to speak on what they perceive to be a [does air quotes] ""witch pursuit thing"". [walks off the stage as the gentlemen in costume get on stage and arrange themselves around the mic]; Oh wait, I'm supposed to be-; Yeah, sure, no. [to Stuart] You go over there.; Right. Right right right. [music starts and they begin singing]; We're all on the same side, you and I.
 Let's all stick togetha, let's try.
 When things are going bad and there's people you need to confront.
 Just be sure it doesn't turn into a witch pursuit thing.; [as the other men provide ambient harmony] Hey guys, there's good witches and there's bad witches, and we stand with you in saying this particular witch needs to be brought down. But that doesn't men we should all be closing parks and stopping all witch activity because [catches up with the others on vocals]; Let's not turn this into a witch pursuit thing.; [to Gerald] Dad, get out of here! We're trying to deal with an actual witch! Nobody's coming after you!; Yes they are, boys! And next they'll be coming after you! 'Cause you're all little sons a witches!; Right. You don't have to worry about us, going around snatching children. Only the other witch does that. [Cartman's face lights up and he looks at Heidi. He gets a mischievous look in his eyes]; Hey, babe.; Oh. Hey Eric.; Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say?; A costume party? With everything that's going on?; Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out.; Well... I guess.; Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.; Well, maybe make it 4:30 if you're bringing the costumes. [Cartman turns left and walks away] I might need a little extra time getting ready.; [stops, then mischievously] Ohohoh, I'm counting on it. [walks off]; Randy, can I talk to you?; Sure, Stephen.; I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives.; [quickly closes the door and walks up to Stephen] Okay, look. You're freaked out, it's understandable.; I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first.; Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun.; Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming?; Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy.; I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience.; [sighs] All right, Stephen. At least give us till tomorrow morning to talk to our wives and prepare them, all right? Can you just give us till morning?; Yeah, sure. [walks to the front door] I'm sorry.; It's okay. It's okay. [Stephen leaves. A few second later, Randy is on the phone calling up someone] Hey, it's Randy. We’ve got until tomorrow morning to sacrifice Stephen to the Devil. I'll explain later, just get everyone together. And, maybe bring just a little bit of crack.; Don't you think we should stay on the main roads, Eric? This seems like a bad place to be right now.; Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party. [loudly] I'm sure the witch won't even notice us.; Eric, come on, this is a bad idea. Let's turn around.; Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready.; [sensing the sarcasm] Is that what this is about? You're still mad about the pumpkin patch, aren't you?; Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch.; I didn't use the bathroom 40 times! [Chip is heard above them] What was that? [the leaves in the trees rustle and she looks up] Eric! Did you hear that?! [she turns to see him, but he's gone] Eric?! Eric! Oh my God! Eric, are you okay?!; [finally appears] Well, well. What have we here?; [barely above a whisper, hiding behind a fallen tree trunk] Sweet. Come on, come on.; Dude, is your dad home?; No, I, I don't know where he is.; We can't find our dads either.; Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group.; We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens.; How are we gonna do that?; There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while.; Who?; [opens the door and looks in] Mr. President, you have an urgent call from a Butters Stotch?; [lost in thought, he perks up] Butters? What's he want? [picks up the phone at his desk] This is the President.; Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you?; [in Butters' room with Kyle and Kenny] Butter him up, Butters.; How uh, how is runnin' the country going?; Oh, it's fine. You know, just makin' the country great again.; Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said?; I got rid of like, six of 'em so far. You know, it's a little harder than I thought.; Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build?; Don't be a dick, Butters. Are you just callin' to shit on my Halloween?; N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads?; Yeah, it was my favorite time of year. Now I just have to celebrate it alone.; Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all.; Lemme guess: Chip Duncan. Oh, that guy was always such a douche.; Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches.; Comin' after all witches? Oh, Jeez...; So you were there when the witch showed up and took your girlfriend.; Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late.; What was your girlfriend wearing?; She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany.; And you didn't stop at all to think that what you were doing might attract a witch?; Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!; No, I'm just saying that if there's a big fat witch around, maybe you shouldn't walk around in the woods dressed as Hansel and Gretel.; Ohhhhh!; Whoa, whoa, not cool, Rick. Not cool.; I will have your badge, sir!; [looks towards the camera] Sorry folks, sorry.; Detective! Detective! Call just came in. The witch has been spotted at Ross Dress For Less.; Everyone to Ross Dress For Less, now!; Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about?; Hello, Stephen.; Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for?; It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children.; What? What uh, What are you doing?; [accompanied by Stuart] Here he is, everybody! Stephen's a bad witch!; Nooo! [people begin to gather around the witches]; We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do!; Oh my God! I see what this is! This witch pursuit thing has you on a witch pursuit thing now! [several police cars pull into the parking lot and officers pour out of them] I'm innocent. Please!; It's over, Stotch. What have you done with the children?; Noho, don't you see?! They're just doing their own witch pursuit thingy now! This is madness! [Chip is heard cackling from up in the air. Everyone looks up to see him flying over Ross Dress For Less, then hug their kids to keep them safe]; [lands and gets off the broom] Hey, what's up, bros?; ""What's up, bros?"" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused?; Yeah, so? I'm a witch.; Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right?; Of course they do. You're all witches too, dudes!; Not like you!; What'd you do with the children?; They're all in here! See? [opens his bag]; [voices heard while light emanates from the depth of the bag] Daddy, help! Mommy, help! Ahh!; I'm going to use their souls to increase my power!; Look! Another witch is flying down now! [a shot of Air Force One flying towards town]; Butters, come on! We've gotta go!; Okay! Where?; I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere!; Holy moly! [leaves his chair and follows the others out]; Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out.; Oh, give me a break, Randy.; No, seriously.; Like if one of you guys had the power I have, you wouldn't use it.; No we wouldn't!; Excuse me. [makes his way to the front of the group]; Oh, hey man!; You're ruining the party for everyone, Chip! I'm here to take you out!; [cackles] You'll never stop me! [levitates] I grow more powerful every moment!; You wanna see real power? [into his pocket mic disguised as a lapel pin] All right, take the shot. [a solar-powered satellite takes aim at the President's location with three beeps, and two lasers shoot down towards it. The shot obliterates Chip, but his bag and broom fall away unscathed. A few moments of stunned silence, and the witches celebrate as Garrison fist-pumps. Two officers quickly come up and open the bag]; [pops out of the bag] I'm free! [two girls pop out]; Mommy! Daddy! [the boy Chip plucked first pops out of the bag]; Is that all of them?; There's one more little girl. Come on out, little girl.; Okay. Just a second.; Com- come on, little girl. Everyone's waitin' on ya.; Okay. Almost ready. Hang on.; [sighs] It's gonna be a while.; Well, we did it, guys.; Everyone will be stoked on us now.; Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.; Everybody follow me! I've got tons of Jack, tons of crack, and a jet! [the other witches cheer and follow him to the jet]; Party's back on! We did it, guys!; [looks back at Sharon] Don't wait up, Sharon! I'm gonna party with El Presidente. [Sharon and remaining townspeople are mad]; All ready to trick or treat?; [bored] Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now.; Cool. I just wanna put on some lip gloss. Do these stockings go with this outfit? I thought maybe I should use the red ones. [Cartman removes his fake teeth and throws them on the floor] Is it cold out? You think I should put a hoodie on over this? Nah, covers up my costume too much, don't you think? [Cartman throws his plastic jack-o-lantern pail to the floor] Okay, all ready. [Cartman perks up a bit] Oh wait, hang on. [she goes back into her closet, Cartman's perk is gone] I can't decide if I should wear leggings or not. Is it gonna be cold? Should I just-"

Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!-; Eric, this isn't working.; Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please!; You called me a whore and pushed me in front of a car.; Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra-; Eric, you just can't keep being mean to me and blaming it on your blood sugar.; But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom!; Yes, hon?; You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here!; Eric, if blood sugar is really the problem, then you need to change how you ear, right?; Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?; Eric, every time I've talked to you about maybe being a vegan with me, you just tell me vegans are pussies. But then you try and blame food and your mom for being-; It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please!; You really mean it?; Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on.; All right, Eric. We'll see how this goes, okay? See you tomorrow.; Okay. Okay, bye, honey. [hangs up]; That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude!; Pissed off at your girlfriend again, huh Eric?; She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore!; That's enough, Cartman! I am so sick of hearing you call Heidi horrible things!; That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship!; [approaching] Hey babe.; Oh hey babe, what's going on?; What are you up to?; [uninterested] Nothin', just tellin' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan.; [happy] That's great. You wanna come eat with me? I can explain what I packed.; Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome. [he leaves with her]; I don't get it. I just really don't get it. How is she still supporting him?!; She loves him, I guess.; But he clearly sucks! She has to know he sucks. What the hell is going on?!; Well, it's not our problem.; It is our problem. This is affecting us! Our whole school. There's got to be a reason she sticks by him.; [spots her and runs up] Oh Heidi? Heidi, you got a sec?; Oh. Hey Kyle.; Hey. Uh, listen, uh... I-I know you and Cartman have an anniversary coming up and, I was just wondering, you know, um. How do you think he's doing? Aaas a boyfriend.; Well, whattaya mean?; Well, you know, like, some of us are thinking that, uh, maybe he's not super-qualified to be with you?; Oh, God, not you too.; Just, like, what are the things about Cartman that you find remotely redeeming?; Look, don't you think I get it enough from my girlfriends? ""He sucks, Heidi. What's wrong with you? Why can't you admit he's a loser? How could anyone ever go with him?"" I was just following my heart. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?; You don't have to get defensive. I just-; [gets in his face] Who's being defensive?! He's great! We're doing great! I didn't make a bad decision! I don't need you to stand there and say ""I told you so!"" [turns around and walks off]; I didn't say ""I... [she whips around again] told you-""; [points at him] You know, you don't know what Eric's like when we're alone, okay? He's actually really good to me. [turns around and walks away]; Wooow.; Heidi! [walks in with a bag of food] Oh my God, you're not gonna believe this.; What?; You were so right [Heidi closes the door] when you said there were vegan options for everything. [puts the food on the table] Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat?; Yeah, the vegan meat that's made with all vegetables and plants.; Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat.; Really? That's great, babe.; So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC.; Oh wow.; It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it.; [Heidi tries a breaded breast] It tasted just like KFC.; I know, right?! Isn't that crazy?! [Cartman eats another breaded breast] Like, like seriously, how can you even tell that this was vegan? Try the, try the Beyond Mashed Potatoes and Gravy too. [hands her the mashed potatoes and gravy] They say you can even drink the Beyond Gravy by itself as like a protein boost. [eats some more of his breast while she eats the mashed potatoes and gravy] I don't know about you, but I could eat this every day.; Yeah, it's really good.; [evilly narrowing his eyes to slits] Delicious.; Guys, listen: I think I know why Heidi won't admit Cartman's a horrible boyfriend.; Dude, are you still on this?; Yeah! It's important.; Maybe she's telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don't see.; [running up to them] You guys! You guys! Have you seen Heidi? [walks on past them]; No.; Well uh, we've been trying some different foods lately and uh, [turns around] Heidi's put on some pounds, you guys.; Heidi's getting fat?; Yeah, Token. Don't start rippin' on me for havin' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it. [smiles]; [walks up behind him] Hey babe.; Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What's goin' on? [a surprised look flashes on his face]; I-ah, I'm not feeling the best again. [Cartman smiles again] I might see if my mom can come pick me up.; Pick you up? That could be tough. [a shot at the boys, who just look blankly at him and Heidi. Kyle, though, is not amused]; I, I know, but I just feel bloated. I think there might have been something bad in that Beyond Arby's.; Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse's office. [the surprised look flashes on his face again, then disappears]; Can you come with?; Oh sure. [they turn around and walk away, but Cartman looks over his shoulder and points at Heidi's bloated figure]; We have to help that girl. Can't you see what's happening?; Kyle, it's none of our business.; You're wrong. In a way... I think we're all going out with Cartman right now.; Uh huh. Yeah, I understand that, faggot. And you should understand how my balls are gonna taste when your country starts needing money. I don't give two shits about a treaty. You're a Polish midget. [A knock is heard at the doors] Come in. [three advisers come in - Mike Pence, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell - and Garrison gets back on the phone] Uh huh. Hang, uh hang on. I'm gonna call you back. Yeah, go fuck yourself, retard. [hangs up]; Mr. President, we have a problem. People are pretty upset.; Hoh, don't tell me people are still made about that nigger thing.; It's pronounced Niger, Mr. President. And it's a country in Africa.; Oh, aren't we fancy. Okay, I don't want a bunch of [finger quotes] Nigers in Africa aiding terrorists.; Mr. President, you need to be a little more careful. There's an investigation. A worker with ties to Russia was found raped and executed.; Raped and executed? Oh, you mean fucked to death? Oh yeah, that was me.; Mr. President, people are starting to question your oath to the office.; My oath to the office was that I would fuck everyone to death, remember?; Ooo, I 'member. Me too, I 'member. I 'member that.; [to the berries] You guys be quiet, [to his advisers] and you guys just get out there and put a positive spin on this whole thing.; How are we supposed to put a positive spin on it?; It's getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it's time we put our foot down.; Oooo. [whips out a remote control and presses a button on it, making the doors close and lock automatically. The advisers turn to see this] Hope you brought some condoms.; Hello. I know things have been difficult between us lately. I know you think all boys are sort of pigs, but just know that a lot of us boys think girls are amazing and smart and beautiful. [dead air] Not, not like hot-beautiful, I mean like inside-beautiful. I, I'm not saying you're hot. You're not, you're not hot. I'm not saying you're ugly. It doesn't matter- you're all hot on the inside. If we could all just see inside you, it would be hot. [realizes he's out on a limb] Oh, shit.; What do you want, Kyle?; It's Heidi Turner. You guys shouldn't criticize her so much for going with Cartman.; Why not? Eric Cartman's a horrible person.; I know! I, I know that, okay? Trust me, I hate Cartman as much as any of you, but just, give her some space, you know? You can't keep on saying ""We told you so"", because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasn't dumb.; Why do you care? Do you like Heidi?; No!; Oh my God, he so likes Heidi.; Obvi.; No I don't! ... Do I?; [walks up to him] Hey, Kyle. Hey, I was thinkin' about what you said. How we should all help Heidi break up with Eric? You're right, it's our moral obligation.; Yeah, no, we're not getting involved with that.; Oh, we're not?; [stands up]Yeah, no, yeah, I uh dya, I think we need to stay out of it. [walks away]; Dialog; Cartman, can we talk?; Sure, Kyle. What's up? [brings out a harness and puts it on]; I just, I hope that maybe you can realize what you have with Heidi and, and just try to be good to her, okay?; Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There's always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it's all part of trying to make each other better. [picks up a big bass drum and straps it onto the harness, then picks up some drumsticks] Someday, maybe you'll have a girlfriend and you'll understand. Oh, here she comes. [at the far end of the hallway, Heidi rounds the corner and walks towards them, and Cartman starts beating the drum] BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi's comin' through.; [walks up to Cartman] Wha, what are you doing, Eric?; I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite.; Oh, okay. Um, are we still on for lunch?; You betcha, can't wait.; Okay, see ya. [walks away, vaguely upset]; [resumes the drum beat] BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!; Some concern over the President's competency again today. It was during a Middle East peace conference when the President referred to the people of Saudi Arabia as a bunch of ""dirty sand Nigers"". Though the comments seem divisive, Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, says he's sticking by his President 100%. [next shot is of Paul Ryan with a black eye stained with semen]; Speaker Ryan, it's the anniversary of the President being elected. How do you think he's doing?; Well whattaya mean? He's great. We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don't get to see all his good qualities.; Uh huh. And is that semen on your black eye?; Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that's just, that's doorknob cum.; You doin' okay, Heidi?; I keep thinking Eric's going to change.; [sits down next to her and sighs] Heidi, people like Cartman, they always make things someone else's fault. We all wrongly see ourselves as the victims sometimes, but Cartman sees himself as the victim all the time. He'll always find someone to blame for his shortcomings, and because of that, he's never gonna change.; Before we started going out I was in a really bad place. I felt... pushed away by society. Then this guy came along who told me all the things I wanted to hear, and I just went with it. Does that make me a bad person? [Rihanna's ""Unfaithful"" begins to play]; No, Heidi. Good people make bad decisions every day.; I've been defending him for so long. I don't know how I'm gonna face people if I finally give up. [next scene is Heidi looking through her scrapbook at the memories she and Cartman created together. His discomfort begins to show in the fourth picture. She closes the book, and her location is shown - she's in bed. Next scene shows her at her locker putting books away when she notices someone looking at her. It's Kyle, looking at her from his locker. He then puts his books into his locker. Next scene shows Heidi and Cartman at the park bench, where she leaves him and he grabs onto her leg to delay her departure. Next scene has Kyle receiving a letter from Heidi. He reads it and smiles. Next scene has Garrison and Xi Jinping holding a news conference, and three bar patrons back at home turning away and crying. Next scene shows the Turners having dinner at a restaurant, in a booth by the window]; [sobbing outside the window] Please Heidi! [he pounds on the window a few times before finally sliding down to the ground] Please! [her parents are stunned. Next scene shows Kyle and Heidi on the school swings, chatting away]; Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei- [Token slams the door on him. Seconds later the doorbell rings. Token goes back to answer it] Hei-, Hei-, Hei-; [not happy] What do you want?; Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Token.; So?; I have nothing now, Token. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please?; What?! Why?! You still have a house!; I know how you feel now, Token. To be pissed off at the world. To feel completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff. [Again, Token slams the door on him. Again the doorbell rings, and again Token goes to answer it] Token, pleeease! I'm sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys feel! Please, what time is your family gonna go disrespect the flag and stuff? I wanna go with!; Get outta here!; [appears behind Token] What's going on?; [upset with Cartman] Nothing, Mom.; Heidi broke up with meeeeee.; Token, he's freezing. [to Cartman] Come on in out of the snow.; [entering] Thank youuuu.; ...NO!!; Okay, we're safe to talk.; It's not safe! Nowhere is safe, don't you understand?! We're all about to get killed!; Sshh, keep your voices down! Look at this!; What are all these numbers?; The latest approval ratings. I've been researching our own independent poll. The President is tanking. These numbers are so low that we just might have an out. Well, don't you guys see what this means?; I don't know anything, I'm just a turtle.; It means that the swing voters are turning against him. It's those people that matter. Those are the ones who can finally turn this thing around!; And then we don't have to get killed! We can't let the President know about this. just let him- [the door opens]; [walks in] What are you guys talkin' about?; No, nothing, Mr. President.; Nothing!; No, nope!; Just having' a little chat or somethin'?; [looks at the folder Pence is holding, takes it, and walks over to the President] It's an opinion poll, Mr. President. Your numbers are down and I wanted to show you so you could do something.; Oh, you bitch! [to the President] I was the one who researched the poll, Mr. President!; Let me see that. [takes the folder and leafs through it] Huh. Isn't that interesting? But it's not a problem. See, I know something about societal psychology that you three turd balls don't. Everything's gonna be fine.; So... You guys about done with the soup?; Don't you like it, Eric?; Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff?; What?; Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it?; What the hell are you talking about?!; I told you not to let him in.; Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt!; I'm sorry your girlfriend broke up with you, Eric, but... maybe you'll get back together.; No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls.; Heidi? Turner? The Turners' daughter?; Yeah...; I thought she was with that Kyle Broflovski kid.; [sadness switches to anger in a flash] What?; I saw them at the park today holding hands.; [dramatic music begins] Kyle? Kyle?! Kyle!! [a montage begins with five marching happy Kyles appearing] Kyle! Kyle! Kyle Kyle Kyle! [a big red heart appears and breaks, and a line of smiling Kyles marches out of it in shades of pink. Next scene is a Jewish dance performed by hasidim. Next scene is Cartman out on the street striking a match...] Kyle! [...and burning a giant flag on the ground with it.] Kyle! [the flames spread to fill up the screen. The next scene shows a cackling Kyle coming up out of the water like a giant sea monster as Eric and Heidi hold on to each other. Kyle holds a menorah reminiscent of a trident. Next scene is another group of hasidim dancing] Kyle! [next scene is Cartman and Heidi running away, only to be stopped by Kyle popping up before them like an exploding volcano, cackling. Cartman and Heidi turn and run away again, but the ground around them is compromised and Kyle's shadow covers them both as they look up at him. Next scene is back at the dining room at Token's mansion] Kyle...; Yeah, Kyle.; KYLE! [the other kids in the hallway clear the way as Cartman appears at the end of the hallway behind Kyle. Dramatic Western showdown music plays] I should have known. You lying snake!; [turns around] Cartman, I didn't mean for things to happen the way they did.; Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?!; Cartman, you weren't happy.; Shut up, Kyle!; All you did was bitch about her all the time.; You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you and me!; Come on, Cartman. I-; [slams Kyle into the lockers] You took everything from me!; Stop it!; All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!; Fuck him up, Eric!; [goes in for the attack] Aaah! [Kyle delivers a punch] Ugh! [Cartman goes down straight away] Fuck you, Kyle!; I'm sorry, Cartman. You just have to accept that Heidi's moved on.; Guys, I just wanna say, here's to Heidi. Welcome back to the land of the living.; Yay Heidi!; [giggles] Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking me out. This is really fun.; No worries. We're just glad you finally came to your senses.; Yeah, no kidding. We seriously thought you might marry that piece of shit! [the girls laugh]; [a bit sheepish] Well, you know, he- he actually had some good qualities too.; Uhh, yeah, like what? Racism?; Or the sociopath part?; Yeah. I mean, no offense, Heidi, but what the fuck were you thinking?; Guys, she admitted she made a mistake.; You make a mistake on your homework. What Heidi did was more like a momentary loss of all sanity. [the girls laugh]; [feeling pushed away again] It was just what I believed in.; Don't worry, Heidi. We're not gonna keep telling you we told you so.; But we told you so. [the girls laugh]; The only thing I wanna know is... how did you bring yourself to actually KISS him?; Eewwww!; Can you imagine? Eric Cartman's breath on your mouth?; Ew, ugh! [this is depressing Heidi as sad music begins to play]; [imitating Cartman] Heidi, come here. I want to kiss you with my tongue!; Ew, ugh! [they laugh as Heidi wilts]; Hi Eric.; What are you doing here?; I don't know. I think I- I just wanna make sure... you're doing okay. I want you to know I'll always care about you.; [sniffles] That's good to know, 'cause like, nothing helps more when you're down than knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care.; [sits next to him] I'm sorry that I've hurt you. I think maybe I am just stupid and I don't know what I want and it ends up hurting people.; No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault.; But I'm the one who-; No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did.; Hey.; Hey! You all set to go?; [walks in] I wanted to talk to you first.; Okay, sure.; Kyle, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and it was all making me really confused.; Yeah, that's understandable.; [turns and holds his hands] I was being manipulated, and I didn't even see it. I never do. And, I don't think you saw it either, Kyle.; What do you mean?; I've come to realize that it's not my fault. It's your fault, Kyle. You made all this happen. Made me question who I was.; But Heidi, I thought-; [puts her index finger on his lips] Shh. [walks away] But it's okay. You can't help it. It's how you were raised, what you were taught. My heritage is Irish, so I'm prone to being moody. And your heritage... well, you know... you can be a little sneaky sometimes and not even realize it. [turns left to walk out the door] I'm sorry, Kyle, but everybody's trying to live life the best they can. It's hard enough without your people always trying to get ahead. [walks out and closes the door]; Dude... did she just call me a dirty Jew? [he walks to the window to see her walk away, and sees Cartman waiting for her. Cartman sees him at the window. Heidi meets Cartman and they walk away together, with Cartman looking over his shoulder at Kyle with a smug look on his face]; Happy anniversary to you.; Cha cha cha.; Happy anniversary to you.; Cha cha cha.; Happy anniversary, Mr. President.
 Happy anniversary to you. 
 
 
[they put the cake on the desk, and the President blows out the candles]; Congratulations, Mr. President.; Looks like many more years of the same are to come.; Oh, I don't think so. [walks out from behind the desk with a giant dildo strapped to his genitals.] I think the next three years are gonna be even better. [begins to laugh. Pence, Ryan, and McConnell laugh in response, but soon begin to cry, as they know what that dildo means]"

[points] Yes, Francis?; It's time for the Special Ed Science Fair. [the other kids cheer]; That's right, the Science Fair is this weekend, and I know you're all very excited to show the projects you've been working on. [more cheers] This week we'll be hearing all about your projects and first up we have Nathan and Mimallah. [amid some applause and chatter, Nathan and Mimsy walk in with their project, a volcano]; For our science fait project, we will be showing the destructive force of nature by simulating a volcano!; Ooooooh.; With vinegar and baking soda, we will make this paper-mâché volcano EXPLODE.; Aaaaaaa.; With the power and fury of Mount Kilauea. Our science fair project is sure to be... a blast. Get it? A. Blast.; All right, what do you guys think of Nathan and Mimallah's project idea? [the kids clap and cheer]; We've done it, Mimsy. We're gonna win the science fair for sure. And then, every chick in this school is gonna wanna have sex with us.; Uh, gee boss, I don't know about sex with no chicken.; [smack] Not those chicks, numbskull. I'm talkin' 'bout bitches. You know what girls like? They like winners. And when we win the science fair, we're gonna be up to our ears in pussy.; Is it just me, or are things around here getting worse and worse?; It's definitely not just you. I think everyone's in shock that Heidi went back to Cartman.; What keeps driving her back to him? It's so weird.; She's so... mean and angry these days.; People change. They say you become more and more like the person you're with and, I guess it's true with Heidi.; [joins the girls at the table] Hey guys. What's up?; Hey, Heidi.; What are you guys talkin' about?; Nothing.; Bullcrap, you're all talkin' about me again. 'Cause you're judgmental bitches. [burps] Ehhh.; Heidi, are you okay? It's just... you look...; I look what?; Ngh, you know, y-you just look-; What? I look fat? Is that what you wanna say, Wendy? Fuck you, bitch!; She's just concerned, Heidi.; [mimicking] ""Mehmehmehmehmehhh, Heidi"". I'm just trying to enjoy my lunch here! Can I do it without you guys shitting on all over me?!; All right, good, Timmy. Test 42a is successful. Let's move on to the next phase. [Nathan and Mimsy walk in]; Well hello, gentlemen.; Oh hey fellas, we're doing great.; Timmih!; Thought we'd stop by to see how your- science fair project is going.; Dah I thought we was comin' to rub their faces in how good our science fair project was, boss.; [gets mad, then smacks Mimsy] Shut up, Mimsyyy! [to Jimmy and Timmy] So what are you guys workin' on?; Oh, it's fantastic. This year, Tim-Tim and I are doin' our project on [looks into the microscope] water bears.; Oh. Water bears. [backs up to Mimsy] You hear that, Mimsy? Like there's any such things as water bears. That blue science fair ribbon is as good as ours. [to Jimmy and Timmy] Well, we've gotta get back to our lava volcano. Good luck finding your, pft, water bears. [he and Mimsy turn around to walk out]; Oh, would you like to see them?; [he and Mimsy stop and turn] What? Uh what are you talking about?; Timmy and I have gathered thousands of water bears. Take a look in the microscope. [Nathan steps forward to look into the microscope. He sees some water bears swimming around on the specimen slide. Jimmy continues] Water bears are water-dwelling, eight-legged micro-animals.; Timmah.; They're one of nature's most resilient animals. [next slide] Studies have shown they can survive lava, and even the vacuum of space.; What-? How-? [looks up] Where the fuck did you learn about these things?; Where all good scientists learn from. Octonauts.; Octonauts!; Some scientists believe the study of water bears is key to human survival.; Aw jeez, that sounds a lot better than a lava volcano, huh boss?; Well, not really, because the science fair is supposed to be an experiment. I fail to see what the experiment is here.; Oh, that's easy. You see, for the past several weeks, Tim-Tim and me have been training the water bears to respond to different sound waves. We found that they respond best to Taylor Swift. Hit it, Timmy. [Timmy presses a button offscreen, and Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do"" begins to play] Take a look. [the Water Bears soon form a circle of eight of them on the specimen slide. Timmy turns off the player] We still have some training to do, but we're excited about the results. I have to admit, your lava volcano is pretty great too. Maybe we could tie for first place. [Nathan looks at Jimmy, then at Timmy, in shock]; Come in.; [enters the office] You wanted to see me, Mr. Mackey?; Oh yes, Heidi, uh, we just wanted to see if you have transportation to the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend, or if you wanted us to set somethin' up for you.; What?; ...Uh, Saturday is the science fair, and, you're the judge for the competition?; Judge a special needs science fair? Ahem, no thanks.; Well, Heidi, is there a problem with you bein' the judge this weekend?; Uhh, yeah? It's Saturday, and I don't wanna be at skewl?; But you're always the judge of the Special Ed Science Fair because you're our best science student.; So now I'm gonna be punished by being force to judge a bunch of handicapped kids?!; But... Okay, you see, the problem is that you volunteered last month, Heidi. You said you wanted to do it, m'kay?; Well how can you expect students to commit to things a month in advance?! [puts away a stray lock of hair under her cap] I don't even know what I want for dinner tonight.; Look, the kids have worked really hard and have done some amazing projects.; You're gonna force me to come to skewl on a Saturday?!; Heidi, eh... is everything all right?; Oh what? Are you gonna call me fat now too?! It just so happens I'm a vegan, which means it'd difficult for me to get enough protein, so my body doesn't burn fat, it burns muscle, which makes it look like I'm fat, but I'm actually WAY healthier than any of YOU!!; Heidi, you're judging the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend.; Oh, Goddammit!; [looks around] Mimsy! Come on! [reaches the door]; Okay Nathan. [joins him]; Shhh, shut the fuck up! [picks the lock and opens the door. They go in, look around, then go to Jimmy and Timmy's project]; Gee, we could get in a lot of trouble. Ya, you sure we should mess with Jimmy and Timmy's science fair project?; Mimsy, do you know what Jimmy is? He's a cock blocker.; Eh what's a cock blocker?; Every time I come up with a way to score with the ladies, there's Jimmy tryin' to one-up me. This science fair is supposed to finally make us successful enough to get chicks.; D'aw, gee, I don't know if we should use our position of power to exploit women.; ... [smacks Mimsy] I'm not letting those assholes win the science fair! [opens a medical bag] That's why I say, the only good water bears are dead water bears. [pulls out a bottle of lighter fluid and pours it into the tardigrade tank, then follows that up with a bottle of lye. He then gets a curling iron, plugs it in and turns it on, and sticks it into the tank, where it sparks and causes a chemical reaction] Let's go! [they run out of the bungalow as the reaction continues inside]; This is bullcrap! How can they force me to be the science fair judge?! Now I know how it feels to be a slave!; It's... not exactly like being a slave, Heidi.; Yes it is! Am I being paid to judge the science fair? No. Do I have a choice? No. ""Ohhh, yes masah. Lemme judge that science fair for ya, suh!""; God, will you stop?!; Theresa, don't get all aggro on me because you're pissed off your family lives in a trailer.; My family doesn't live in a trailer. We live in a tiny home. My parents downsized to make a smaller footprint on the environment.; That's what I said. Your family lives in a trailer.; There's lots of progressive people living in tiny homes. There's five others on my block.; Right. That's called a ""trailer park.""; A-hi don't live in a trailer park!; [to Theresa, about Heidi] Just don't even respond to her. Just ignore her.; I'll try, but she's such a bitch.; She wasn't talking to you, Heidi.; Oh, looks like Isla has something to say, you guys. Hold on, I'm sure this is going to be really profound. Go ahead, Isla, knock us out with you wit and satire. This should be good, you guys.; [walks up to Heidi] Hey Heidi, what's up?; [uninterested] Oh hey babe, what's going on?; What are you up to?; [her voice trails off] Nothiiing, just talking to my girlfriends about tiny homes.; Well hello there, ladies.; Oh, hi Nathan.; We just wanted to remind you [hand Nichole a flyer] that this weekend is the Special Ed Science Fair.; Oh, cool.; Yeah, that's right. Pretty soon you'll all be impressed with what you see. Hope you can make it. [walks off with Mimsy. Moments later...] Did you see that, Mimsy? The way those girls bit their bottom lips when I said ""science fair""? We're about to be drowning in muff.; Nathan! Mimallah! Yuh, you've gotta get to Special Ed!; Special Ed class isn't for another two hours.; Nono, you've gotta see this! Jimmy and Timmy's water bears! They've changed!; What?; Jimmy and Timmy, this is incredible! You've somehow made them even smarter. [Francis, Nathan and Mimsy enter]; What's goin' on?; Nathan, it's amazing. The water bears we've trained are starting to display social advancements.; But they're supposed to be dead. [Nathan smacks him]; [walks up to Jimmy and Timmy's table] What social advancement?; They've actually evolved to the point of doing the hokey pokey.; The hokey pokey? [looks down into the microscope and sees the tardigrades. ""The Hokey Pokey"" plays as the water bears begin synchronized dancing] You've gotta be fucking kidding me.; Boys, this might be the single greatest Special Ed Science Fair project I've ever seen!; Butters.; Whoa. [turns around] Uh hey.; How would you like to be the judge for the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend?; Uhh, I can't. I'm going to a birthday party.; Butters, don't be a dick!; Yeah, don't make up excuses because judging handicapped students sounds terrible!; Yeah, Butters! God! [rolls his eyes]; [walks up to Heidi and Cartman] He's not making it up. It's my birthday party.; Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair.; [walks into view with Kyle] What's wrong with supporting them? They're our friends.; Because nobody wants to be trapped, in a gym, with Special Ed Science.; Actually, some of their projects are pretty cool.; Shut up, Kyle! [to each other] Samesies! [they kiss each other on the lips]; Look, it's all just a complete waste of time! It's not like the Special Ed Science Fair is actually gonna contribute to society. [a helicopter is heard over the school. In front of the school, the helicopter lands on the lawn as several black cars and vans roll up to the school. A bunch of men in black suits get out of the vehicles and walk into school]; [leading the men] Move. Move aside, kids. Official business!; Move it, children. [the kids make way for the NFL owners]; Excuse me, can I help you?; We understand that you're about to have a science fair with some very interesting experiments.; That's right, the science fair is this Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm.; We're here to help however we can. Your special ed department has all our resources and all our support. This science fair... just might be what saves us all.; What the hell is going on?! Everywhere I turn, people are being given handouts while I'm forced to work my ass off! It's total bullshit!; Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun?; [stops pacing] Relax?! How can I relax?! I get straight A's! I ace every test! And who gets all the support?! The Special Ed Department!; Good. Bring it on in. These kids need to have access to everything they need.; Wow, look at this, Tim-Tim. They've all been researching water bears too.; That's correct. [two workers roll up a whiteboard with a diagram of a tardigrade on it, with parts of the body clearly labeled] Like you, we've come to realize that water bears are the key to our future. [walks up to the project right after Jimmy and Timmy do] Are these the special water bears that we read about on your school message board?; That's right. The water bears we've been working with appear to be evolving somehow.; Then they are the key to our survival, boys.; Gentlemen, perhaps I can interest you in a lava volcano. You won't believe your eyes when I add some simple baking soda.; [turns to face him] There's no time for that! We need everyone working on Jimmy and Timmy's project. I'm gonna let you kids all in on a little secret. We don't wanna create a panic, but... the End is very near. And we have very little time.; Fellow students, I have asked to speak today because of the hypocrisy and bullying that is coming from the administration at this so called... skewl. It is an outrage that our principal and counselor denand our participation in privileged programs that are outrageously overfunded. Why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to special needs students? Are the rest of us not special? If we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs, then soon we will all be poor, and forced to live in a trailer park like Theresa.; It's not a trailer!; Theresa, [that lock of hair comes down again] get over it, you live in a trailer park, it's not a big deal. [she puts the lock back in place]; Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie.; What did you say?!; Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with.; GET THIS OVER WITH?! You're supposed to be supporting me!; I am supporting you, sweetheart!; Being supportive doesn't mean you criticize me, asshole! Just forget it! My point is, if the school administration doesn't cancel the science fair, I will see to it that they are all fired for discrimination!; [standing by the gym doors, to PC Principal] She's... kind of like Cartman, but with the ability to follow through.; Oh, dude. Bro.; Francis, can you hand me the sound wave generator? [Frances hands it to him]; This is bullshit! The Special Ed Science Fair is turning into a lovefest for Jimmy and Timmy's project! They're gonna get all the fame and glory!; D'aw, I guess we kind of shot ourselves in the foot, huh boss? If it weren't for us, those water bears wouldn't have even gotten smarter in the first place.; [stops and thinks] Hey, Mimsy, that's right. They don't deserve the credit, we do. [speaks up] Uh, excuse me. If you're all trying to figure out why these water bears are different, you're talking to the wrong guys. [Everyone turns to face him]; Wha-what do you mean, Nathan?; Mimsy and I did some experimenting with the water bears on our own.; We was tryin' to kill 'em. [smack]; It was us who made them evolve, so we should be the ones working for the government.; The government? Wuh we aren't the government.; Yuh you're not the government? But you said you were here to help stop us from becoming extinct.; Not you, us. We're with... the NFL. Our fans are leaving at an exponential rate. We've been hit with anthem protests, protests of those protests, and worst of all, concussions. The more reports that come out, the more people are getting turned off by football. We've been experimenting with water bears because... we believe they are our last hope.; Oh, I get it. You've been experimenting with water bears to see how to make humans more impervious to concussions.; No. We've been experimenting with water bears to try and make them... FANS.; A beautiful night for football here in Los Angeles as the Chargers take on the Buffalo Bills.; And a record sellout crowd here at the stadium. Football clearly more popular than over with a whopping 17 million in attendance. [shown are a smattering of fans, with the rest of the seats being occupied by small tanks of tardigrades]; The NFL, of course, working really hard to reach new viewers, and it looks like they found their answer in tardigrades.; [a camera crew focuses on one tank] The water bears are thrilled to be here and of course, love seeing themselves on the Jumbotron. [which shows that tank's sea bears onscreen] They're all ready for some football and enjoying the fan favorite Kiss Cam. [two tardigrades are shown kissing]; And we're ready for kickoff as the cheers of 17 million fans rock the stadium! [the Chargers kick off and the Bills catch the football and begin their charge. Nothing but crickets are heard as a Bills player is taken down]; We're running out of time. We have to see if these water bears truly are different. Insert the box. [a fellow owner grabs a microscopic box with tweezers and carries it over to the table. He puts it into the specimen slide] Gently. What do you see now? [the tweezers are removed]; Ahhh, Iii see the box. [a microscopic FedEx box] What, what's in the box?; What are the water bears doing?; Uhhh, they're just walkin' around and ubb, oh wait! They appear to be interested in the box.; These water bears are different. [the classroom door opens and in walk Heidi, Cartman, Mr. Mackey and PC Principal]; All right, everyone, listen up. Give me your attention please. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we are cancelling the Special Ed Science Fair. [the students begin to talk amongst themselves]; What? Cancelling?; You can't cancel the science fair. We're on the verge of a breakthrough here.; It's cancelled. You guys can get all this shit out of here and leave. Thank you!; You don't understand! The Special Ed Science Fair is our only hope!; Oh I'm sorry, but um, our hands are tied... by Heidi. [Jones and the other owners whip out their guns]; I think you all fail to see the seriousness of our situation! Football is dying!; [he and PC Principal put their hands up] Whoa, whoa whoa, okay.; [to another owner] Close the door! [the owner closes the door] Everyone back to work! Nobody... [two special ed kids and Cartman slip out of view] will stop this Special Ed Science Fair!; [with his gun aimed at Nathan] Do what he says!; Oh! Uh okay, Jesus Christ!; [finds Cartman] Are you just gonna stand there?! Do something!; What the hell do you want me to do?!; I want you to have some BALLS and act like you care about me!; Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch!; [gets closer to him] Call me a bitch again! Do it! [gets in his face] Call me a bitch again!; You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend.; That's what I thought!; Hey, uh wait a minute! The water bears have changed again. I think it's working.; Let me see that! [looks through the microscope] Yes. Yes, they're starting to adapt. [the water bears now sport jerseys from various teams. He increases the magnification] Sonofabitch, we just might have ourselves some fans! [stands up] Now quickly, children! We must replicate these water bears to create more! [Nathan gets back on the microscope]; If nobody else is going to do anything, I will! [runs up to the microscope, yanks the fish bowl from it, and runs to the door]; Wha-ah?; The water bears!; Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?!; Move it! Get the fuck out of the way! I said get out of the way, you assholes! [followiong are the NFL owners, the special ed kids, Mr. Mackey and PC Principal, ...and Cartman]; We got the fat girl, front of the school.; Shit! [turns around and goes back inside, only to see all the people chasing her down]; Little girl, stop! [Heidi begins to pant] It doesn't have to end this way.; [makes his way to the front of the group] Move aside! Move aside! [finally sees Heidi] Heidi, seriously, you need to listen to me!; I don't... have to listen... to anybody!; Yes, yes you do! You need to listen!; Fuck you!; No, fuck you!; Little girl, please! What you have in your hand is very special.; Well I'm sick of everyone treating me like shit!; Think about the NFL. How much joy it brings to everyone!; Don't listen to them. Give the water bears to me. I deserve all the fame and bitches.; Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry.; Look, if you- if you don't do it for the NFL, what about humanity? Those creatures are showing the first signs of sentience. Think about what they could mean for science. For medicine. Making people better.; Come on, babe. We all want the old Heidi back. [Heidi looks up at the balcony and notices Wendy, Theresa, and Isla looking down upon her]; [looks down at the water bears, then looks up again] Screw all you guys!; NOOOO! [Heidi chugs the fish bowl down like a college student, wipes her lips, then burps]; Dude, wwow.; [angrily] Is there something you wanna talk about?; No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence.; Whatever. It's Saturday, and I'm not in skewl.; Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl.; [goes back to eating chips] How come we never snuggle anymore?!; [alarmed] Wha, what?; We used to snuggle all the time and it's totally gone away! What happened?!; Well, but honey, we still-; SNUGGLE!; [gets closer to her] Yes yes, let's, let's snuggle, yes. [she shares her blanket and snuggles]; Goddammit, how come there's nothin' to watch on Saturday but kids cartoons?!; Hohall right, kids. Now let's do the hokey pokey. [begins to sing the song]; Oooo. [her belly begins to move to the music] What's goin' on in here?; Oh, what is goin' on in here?; I feel somethin' moving around. I-it- [farts]; Yeesh. [backs away]; [farts again] SNUGGLE!; Okay, okay, honey. [gets close to her again, but she farts again] Eughah, ah.; Well, did you have any luck, Mr. Jones?; I'm afraid, Commissioner, that the Special Ed Science Fair failed to produce more viable water bears.; Then the NFL truly has no hope.; We're done for.; Not quite. [a lab worker wheels something in and leaves] We were able to obtain somethin' else [picks up a beaker] that just might be our future. [pours the beaker into the volcano Nathan offered to him earlier]; Ooohhhh!"

[smiles] Last year we approved 16 original shows and movies; and this year, it is our goal to make that number 1,087. That's why we here at Netflix are thrilled to be working with you two comedy geniuses, Terrance & Phillip. [Terrance & Phillip are shown, now as elderly gentlemen. Terrance raises his left leg slowly and lets out a wet fart. The president laughs and claps] Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Classic stuff. Now go ahead and pitch what you're thinking for your Netflix original series.; Well, we were thinkin' that we'd do a show where Phillip and I are on a farm... with a cow.; [still enthused] Okay, I love it so far.; [slowly] The sun is just starting to come up and then... I fart on Phillip.; [slowly] And I say, ""Terrance, you farted,"" and I fart on Terrance.; And it's like a back and forth kind of thing? It's sort of like a-?; [slowly] It's like a back and forth kind of thing. I fart on him, he farts on...; On you. Got it!; No! On the cow. [they both laugh]; Welcome to Netflix, you sons of bitches. YEAH!; Hooray!; Come on, Tweek. Hurry!; What's going on?; [running by] Cartman and his girlfriend are fighting again. [Stan closes his locker door and joins the others. They get to the actual fight, where Heidi throws punches at Cartman]; Oh. Uh. Oh. Ugh! Goddamn! [he punches her once] Oh. Sweetheart!; Piece of shit! [punches him four times, he grunts as he gets hit]; Honey, I wanna watch Terrance & Phillip with my friends!; You promised we'd have a date night! [punches him twice]; It's just one night, babe. Stan is having a viewing party, honey. [punches her once]; So then why can't I come?; Terrance & Phillip is a guys' night thing, baby.; [arrives to separate them] Uh, hey, hey, hey! What the hell are you all doing?; Watching Heidi get her bitch-ass kicked!; Fuck you, Wendy!; Don't take that crap, Heidi! Let Cartman have it!; Guys! Guys, this has gone on way too long. Can't we all stop being so mean to each other? [a moment of reflection around the crowd]; Shut up, Kyle. You sound like your mom. [everyone laughs]; Th- that was awesome, baby. I love you. [reaches out and takes her hand]; I love you too, babe.; Awww. [disappointed, everyone disperses]; Dammit.; Fight's over. Kyle ruined it. [Kyle is left all alone in the hallway]; Alright everyone, listen up. As you know, there's been a lot of bullying and insensitivity at our school. To counteract this, it is my firm belief that South Park Elementary is in desperate need of s a strong woman. So in looking for a new vice principal, we wanted to find a powerful, intelligent, and independent female to be a role model for us all. And with that said, I'd like to introduce our new vice principal, Strong Woman. [claps, then hands the mic to her as she walks up]; Thank you, PC Principal. Alright everyone, listen up. I'm the new vice principal of this school. My name is Strong Woman. I've already spent a few days here at the school watching and observing and we definitely have things we can all be working on. [at this point, Butters is whispering something in Clyde's ear]; [snatches the mic from Strong Woman's hand] Hey! Stotch! You do not disrespect Strong Woman by talking when she's talking!; You really think I couldn't have handled that? Myself?; Oh. Uh, I was just making sure everything was uh-; You really had to grab the mic out of my hand like that?; Shit. I mean, no, sorry, sorry, I'm not u-, uh, here you go. [hands the mic back to her]; I want the girls here at this school to know that they can talk to me about anything, but I also want the boys to know what I'm looking for is a better place for everybody. [walks forward a bit] Turning this school around is going to take work from everyone.; From everyone!; [glances back at him] Sorry, am I not doing this correctly?; No. NO! Sorry, I thought I'd... add, just add for emphasis.; You felt it wasn't strong enough? Me just saying it?; No-I, I'm... Uh, I'm sorry.; [sighs, turns back to students] I'm looking forward to being your vice principal, and I'm looking forward to turning this school around.; [moves up] Alright, now if we have any q-; I'm not finished!; [backs up] Right, right, uh, I'm sorry. Every- pay attention everybody!; It's the Terrance & Phillip Sho-o-ow.; On Netflix. [the camera pans down to the duo. Terrance holds a pitchfork]; Hey Terrance, what did the black lawyer say to the Muslim priest?; I don't know, Phillip. What? [Phillip climbs up a three-step ladder, turns around, and farts on Terrance. They laugh at each other. The kids watching at Stan's living room laugh at them, but Kyle looks rather disinterested. The doorbell rings]; Come in!; [walks in with Heidi] Did we miss it?; It's just starting.; Oh look, honey. Kyle's mom is here. Shouldn't you be at temple, Ms. Broflovski? [Kyle is shocked as the others laugh]; [walks into view] Hola. Would you like to buy some chimichangas?; Si, mi amigo. [climbs onto the hay bale next to him as Phillip goes up the stepladder] Here, I'll give you two pesos. [he and Phillip take turns farting on the vendor. The kids in Stan's living room laugh]; Dude, that's awesome.; [notices Kyle isn't laughing] What, what's wrong, dude.; For the first time I feel kind of bad for the person being farted on.; Uf, Kyle's mom doesn't like the cartoon, guys. Better shut it off. [everyone laughs]; Baby, I fuckin' love you so much.; Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you all know, we've been looking for a strong woman to take on the role of vice principal at this school. We couldn't be happier with the selection we've made and we're sure she'll be making our school a better place. So with that let me turn over the floor to our new vice principal, Strong Woman. [applause all around]; Thanks everyone. Alright, listen up. [gathers her papers up] I fully appreciate that some of you might be uncomfortable with me being here. Earlier today, I noticed that some faculty weren't sure whether to call me ""Miss Woman"" or just ""Strong."" If I were a man, you'd probably address me as Vice Principal Woman, so why should it be any different, huh? We good?; Uhm'kay.; So I've been getting to know some of the students here and I'm definitely hearing a lot of frustration and confusion over issues that all the schools are facing right now. I also spent some time observing in the cafeteria and was pretty shocked by the abusive and intolerant language. [as she speaks, Hootie & The Blowfish's ""Hold My Hand"" begins to play in PC Principal's head] Not sure if any of you have noticed, but a lot of the girls are eating their lunches out on the playground to avoid being around the toxic environment that's been created. It's my intention to make the cafeteria... P.E. class is another huge problem at this school. The girls' gym outfits seem not to have been updated since the '60s. We have a lot of work to do here. I intend to do it quickly. [in PC Principal's mind, everything around her fades out and all he sees is her against a pink background with hearts everywhere, soon replaced by flowers and leaves, then a blue sky with clouds]; Excuse me uh, I'm sorry, but uh, is anyone else hearing Hootie & The Blowfish like, very very softly?; Yeah, yeah, I hear it.; [rises and walks towards PC Principal] It's, it's coming from over here somewhere.; E-excuse me everyone, I um, I need to get to the restroom. Sorry, I'll be right back. [rushes out the door, and the song disappears with him]; Therefore what God hath joined together let no man [Terrance farts on the preacher] Oh! [the duo laugh. Kyle just gets off the merry-go-round and walks off campus. He walks onto a small stone bridge, where he looks at his reflection on the water below. He then leaves the bridge and goes home to look at his reflection on full-length mirror in his room. He takes off his jacket and hangs it up]; That's it. That's it, Kyle. [Kyle takes off his Terrance & Phillip T-shirt and puts it away is his trash can, then goes to his dresser to pull out a baby blue shirt and puts it on. He then goes to the vanity mirror, takes off his hat, and gives himself a haircut] No more. No more of them doody jokes. [he leaves the bathroom and goes back to the mirror in his room] No more watching cartoons of people, people having go doody. [he checks himself out on the mirror] And poo-pooing on each other's heads. [he puts on his jacket and hat back on] It's not funny anymore, it is, Kyle? [he checks himself out once more]; Hello there, misterr... Principal, is it?; That's right, I'm PC Principal.; Hm what's bringing you in today?; I'm uh... having this problem with my ears. There's like a persistent kind of ahh ringing going on.; [checking the right ear canal with a scope] O-kay, can you describe the ringing?; It's um, Hootie & The Blowfish.; You're hearing a song? [walks to the other side to check out the left eat canal]; Yeah, uh, ahem, there's a new woman that has joined our faculty. Her name is Strong Woman, and uh, she seems to have set off some kind of device in my ears.; So maybe you're having some feelings for her.; No, that couldn't be it. We work in the same place, so it would be impossible for me to like her. I'm thinking there's some sort of device in my ears.; Well, I looked, and Hootie & The Blowfish aren't in your ears. I believe you're hearing them in your mind and your heart.; Oh, dude. Bro.; You may enter. [Kyle walks in and sees her putting her books in order]; Vice Principal Woman?; Yes? [sits at her desk] What can I do for you?; My name's Kyle, and I've been doing a lot of changing lately. I came because I might be able to offer some... insight into our problem here.; Please, by all means.; You see, there's a culture at this school that embraces meanness, and I believe now that it comes from a Canadian TV show. All the boys watch it. I did too. We all laughed while they... farted... on innocent people's heads. The thing is, I never felt for the person being farted on. Until now. I want to work with you to open people's eyes, because I get it now.; [not following] You want to blame farts? That seems kind of ridiculous, doesn't it?; What?; I mean, it's a slippery slope when we start pointing the finger at our own shortcomings.; But, but I thought for sure YOU would be on my side.; Kind of sounds like something my mother would say, actually.; What?? D'oh, forget it! [turns around and walks out]; May I have your attention please? Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Thank you. [begins to laugh. The kids around Kyle begin to laugh as well]; [over the PA system] Come on, we've gotta get out of here.; Rrrrr!; You wanted to see me, PC Principal?; Uh YES. Yes, Mackey, um, I just wanted to see how you thought it was going with Strong Woman.; Well, she seems to be acclimating fine, ukay, the kids really respect her.; Do you know, uh, [begins to fumble on his words] Do you know if Strong Woman has a boyfriend?; What??; No-nothing. Just forget it. [leaves his desk and walks towards the door]; Are you out of your fuckin' mind?! Askin' if a coworker is available in today's times?!; I just wanted to know because she's unavailable, then maybe I can get my head off of her, alright?; Oh boy, this is bad! This is real bad!; [turns around] I don't know how it happened. I know it's inappropriate and yet I can't stop thinking about her. I think I'm... sick.; Look, this is real fucking fire you're dealing with, uhkay?! I'm gonna get someone down here from HR!; HR? Is that like... Hootie Removal?; No! Human resources! The people that come in to make sure everything's kept on the level! We gotta get you back on track!; Is Canada a bad influence on the United States? A group of young people called ""Millennials Against Canada"" thinks so, and we are joined by their leader, Kyle Broflovski.; Thanks for having me, Tom.; Young man, you say Canada is to blame for most of our problems.; All I'm saying is that there's a culture that originates from Canada which is at least partly to blame for the state of our country now.; To respond to this we're now joined by the Canadian Minister of Streaming.; Thanks for having me, buddeh.; Minister, how do you answer to these angry millennials?; Well, they're pissed off because their country sucks, so they wanna point the finger at us.; I'm saying we're all guilty too. I grew up watching Terrance & Phillip, and I thought it was funny.; So you thought it was funny, but now it's not funny?; No, it was never funny. I see it differently now.; Oh, so you want to censor it.; We don't wanna censor it, we just wanna... get rid of it.; Uh huh, you sound like a Jewish mother.; Oh, see? That's what I'm talking about, right there! That kind of mean, degrading, Canadian trash!; Now I resent that! I find that racist-; Canadians should care about the rest of the world!; You are a racist, fwiend, and if you have a problem with Canada, maybe you should speak to your backwards President!; Maybe I will!; 'Kay, go ahead!; Maybe I know the President!; Oh, sure you do! Just like all Jewish moms, 'cause you don't understand how-; Stop calling me that!; Can I finish?!; That's all you know is how to be mean-; That's not a- Can I finish, please?!; Because you were all raised on it yourselves!; Please, can I finish?! [a few seconds of silence] Alright, I'm finished.; Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you know, we want to provide a safe work environment for all our employees. Sometimes feelings do arise and we are tempted by the Devil to act upon them. So we've been reaching out to Human Resources division as I think we can all use someone to tell us about what is and isn't considered misconduct. She has some great advice for us, so please welcome Heather Conduct. Go ahead, Miss Conduct.; Hello, everyone, my name is Miss Conduct. I'm hear to talk about making sure we avoid any trouble at this school. M'alright?; [smiles] Uh m'kay.; M'alright. Now, by a show of hands, who's ever had inappropriate feelings for a coworker? [Strong Woman raises her hand. PC Principal is surprised]; Well hello there, little girl.; Are you selling Girl Scout cookies?; Well yes I am. How about a Snickerdoodle?; Alright, you asked for it. [raises his right leg up high slowly and farts on the girl. The duo laugh] Oh! Oh, I think I shit my pants.; [runs into view blowing a referee whistle] Alright! That's it! Everyone stop! We're shutting it down! [the show's crew is stunned, and adult members of Millennials Against Canada come in and confiscate the equipment] We are Millennials Against Canada. We demand this kind of bullying Canadian entertainment be stopped!; Didn't think I'd live long enough to see this all happen again.; More and more millennials are turning into Jewish mothers today as they demand the censorship of entertainment. The protesters say they're not giving up and are demanding to speak with the President of the United States.; [walks up to Kyle with a ringing cell phone] Here you go. Call is coming in on your phone.; Good. Give it here. [receives it and answers] Yes, hello? This is the leader of Millennials Against Canada.; [calling from his living room] Kyle, what the fuck are you doing? [Everyone present at the viewing party is there again, except Kyle]; Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking a stand and doing something. I realize this doesn't gel with your nihilism!; Okay, dude. I didn't wanna have to say this, but you're really starting to sound like your mom.; I'm not like my mom! I'm gonna make a difference! It's gonna feel real good!; [runs up and takes the phone from Stan] Kyle! Kyle! Don't do this, man! You can't mess with this shit while You Know Who is in office! We're all gonna die!; M'alright, so now everyone, we're gonna do some role-playing, m'alright? Talk about appropriate ways we can talk in the workplace. Can I, can I get a volunteer to role-play with me? M'alright? [looks towards Mackey] How about you, Mr. uh...; Mr. Mackey.; M'alright, come on up here. [he joins her] M'alright now, we're just gonna pretend it's a normal mornin' before work, and we're startin' the day. [shakes hand] Oh, Mr. Mackey. Good mornin'!; [a bit awkward] Good morning, uh, Miss Conduct.; Now, did you have a nice night?; Yeah, yeah it was good.; M'alright. Okay. Uh good luck today, and I hope that our workin' relationship can continue to be honest and straightforward.; Oh, ah I'm very open and honest, I promise you that.; I can see that. You got very honest eyes, m'alright. [turns to the rest of the faculty] M'alright, I probably shouldn't have said ""You have honest eyes"", m'alright. That's a big crossin' the line, commentin' on his physical attributes, m'alright? That's bad. I'm gonna stick to just talkin' about work only, m'alright? [back to Mr. Mackey] So, uh, Mr. Mackey, what methods do you use for counseling the students?; Oh, I mostly use a semi-cognitive approach adapted by Kiezrick Solomon.; Wow, you studied Solomon? He was actually my thesis in college.; Are you serious? Nobody I talked to has ever even heard of him!; No! Same here! What made you attracted to his work?; Well it's just such a na-natural approach, m'kay?; M'alright, m'alright.; When I read it, you know, first I was like ""whoa, okay!""; M'alright.; ""This just really makes sense"", you know?; [giggles] Well, m'alright.; Mmmm'kay; M'alright. [they smile at each other]; Mr. President! You need to do something about your millennials!; [plucking with his eyebrows] What do you want me to do?; Terrance & Phillip are Canada's largest export! They account for 80% of our gross national product! If your citizens mess with them, they mess with all of us!; Look, I'm President of the United States. I can't get involved in every petty little protest against a third-world country.; Third-world country?! [steps forward] How dare you! Canada is second-world at least! [reaches the desk] Now you listen here, Mr. Buddeh! Either you stop the embargo on The Terrance & Phillip Show, or we'll bring in our own troops to stop it ourselves!; Are you threatening us, you beady-eyed Canuck?; I'm simply telling you that Canada will do what it must to protect itself!; Then I guess both our countries better be prepared.; And then, you know, I was-I was looking to get away from the city. [uncrosses his legs] I've never really been a city person.; M'alright, m'alright, I definitely get that, m'alright.; [crosses his legs again] I like hikin' around, bein' around in nature, m'kay.; No, I agree, I agree, the city's bad. I love hikin' too. What are some of your favorite places?; Well, you know, Mt. Evens is always nice.; [chuckles] M'alright, m'alright. [they uncross their legs as a siren sounds]; What the hell is that?; [checks his phone] There's some kind of... military alert going out.; [stands up and looks out the window] All right, military alert, everyone! Let's get to the hallways and get the students to the gymnasium! Come on, let's move!; [looks out a window] It's the National Guard.; The National Guard?; It's the President. He wants to talk to you. [hands him the phone]; Yes. This is Millennials Against Canada.; Yeah, listen, this thing's kind of escalating. You people need to call it quits.; We can't do that, Mr. President. Someone has to do what's right.; What exactly do you want?; What do I want? I want a world... where laughter doesn't come at someone else's expense. Where people can live freely without fear of being farted on. I want a world where you aren't ridiculed for trying to help. A world where a nice girl that I liked isn't turned into another Eric Cartman! These Canadians are in the way of that world, and everything they do and everything they have done needs to be erased from the Earth!; Jeez, I got a little chub.; Let's go! Everyone to the gymnasium now!; You heard her! Move it, people! [more students run towards the gym. As the last of them runs by, he turns around] I have to make sure all the classes are empty. You go take cover with the kids.; I'm coming too. I'm your vice principal.; Alright, come on! [they reach the faculty room] Oh no.; What's wrong?; Vice Principal Woman, I need to ask you something.; Okay?; This is very difficult, but, uh...; What? What?; [clears his throat] Well, as you can see, there's a door in front of us.; Yes, there is.; I would like to open this door for you. However, I understand the gender-based biases this can imply.; Why do you need to open the door?; I don't need to open the door. I'd just be opening it and holding it the same way I would for Counselor Mackey, a student, anyone else.; Somebody's gonna have to open the door, or we could die out here."

Momm-mmy! [her bedroom door opens and her parents walk in. Her dad flicks on the lights] He's gonna get me!; Honey, honey, who's gonna get you?; The President! I saw him! He's gonna get me!; Crystal, the President isn't going to get you.; But I saw him!; [to his wife] See what I told you? It's that liberal school she's going to, filling her head with all kinds of garbage! Sweetie, the President is doing the best job he can. Your liberal school is just trying to convince you he's dangerous.; But Daddy, he's getting-; Uh uh, no buts! The President is in the White House, not here trying to get you. Okay?; Oh-kaaay?; All right. [he and Mom walk out the door, and he tells Mom] We're having a talk with that school in the morning! [turns to Crystal] Good night, honey. [turns off the lights, and the couple goes to their room. Thunder and lightning get Crystal out of bed and she goes to her window. She sees a shadow on the walkway outside. When lightning flashes, she sees it's indeed the President.]; Hey! How are my approval ratings?! [Crystal runs back to bed]; And the latest reports are now saying that over a million Canadians were killed in the nuclear blast. The bomb dropped by the U.S. President took out the entire city of Toronto, and fallout is expected to kill thousands more in the coming days. [a moment of silence follows, and Ike appears at Kyle's door.]; Ike... Ike, I'm sorry that I caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on Canada. I was just- you know, I was just trying to get shows that were toxic taken down. You know, those shows can be really harmful.; Ohhh, stop being a victim! Jesus Christ! [turns left and walks away. Kyle is left with his jaw dropped, then goes back to moping]; What I wanna know is, what gives you the right to preach your political views to my children?! Our daughter woke up with nightmares that the President was going to get her! Just because two liberals happen to be principal and vice principal doesn't mean you can brainwash my kids!; Uh, we sort of have some bigger problems right now, Mr. Uh...; It's White. Bob White. You probably never even heard of our family, huh? Well, the Whites have been here since the beginning! Not that it matters, 'cause no one cares about the Whites. Sure, everyone else has problems, but does anyone ask the Whites how they're doing?!; Mr. White, we assure you that we run this school in a very [glances at PC Principal] professional manner and don't let [glances again] personal emotions get in the way. [glances again. He looks back, and their eyes are locked]; Oh, sure you don't! You know how hard I had to fight to even get this meeting with you?! ""Oh, who wants to talk to the administration? Oh, it's just the Whites? Oh, who cares about the Whites? They're fine!"" Well, we've just about had with you, you understand? [a song plays that drowns out Mr. White's rant: Barbara Mandrell - ""(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right""] And damn it, we won't be ignored!; [hearing the song somehow] I'm sorry, is anyone else hearing ""(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right"" very very quietly?; Uh, no. Mr. and Mrs. White, we promise that we will not let anything happen that might bring the integrity of this school into question.; Guess that's all the Whites can hope for these days.; Hey!; Aaaagh!; How are my approval ratings?; It's the President! Gaaahhh! [rides away quickly]; Wait, come back! What's wrong?; Still no word from the President as his Splatty Tomato approval rating drops to an unprecedented 3%. This puts the President four points below Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature. Meanwhile, the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau called upon Canadians to stand strong.; [stands behind a tattered podium with a Canadian flag on it.] Make no mistake, America! If you do not hand over your President, there will be war the likes of which you have never seen! Canadians will rise together! I call on all Canadians here and abroad to stand with their country! The U.S. President must answer for his crime, and only Canada can bring him to justice! [Trudeau himself was bombed, as he is charred and tattered as well. Ike, having seen the broadcast, gets angry and walks off]; [pats him on the shoulder] There there, Tweek. Everything is going to be okay.; I saw what I saw, Craig! You have to believe me!; [Him and Stan walk up with their bikes] What's going on?; Tweek's having a panic attack.; It was real! He tried to get me!; Who did?; The President! [Stan looks away, as if Tweek's statement hit close to home]; It's just your imagination, Tweek.; It's not his imagination. I saw him too.; You saw the President?; Out by the quarry. But I didn't believe it. I said, ""How could this be...""; ...""The President?"" [Her and Cartman walk up with their bikes] I saw him too. He had a blue suit and an orange face. He kept asking me ""How are my ap...""; ""...How are my approval ratings?"" [walks up with his bike] I saw him too.; Dude, isn't this all really familiar? I saw something just like this on that show called Stranger...; [rides up on his bike] ...Stranger Things. Stranger Things is the show. I saw it too.; But wait, isn't Stranger Things just like that movie-?; Just like that movie It.; You saw It too?; Yeah, I saw It in the theater.; I saw Stranger Things AND It.; Jesus. I don't think anyone's imagining anything. I think the President IS here. You kids get inside somewhere. I have to warn the town! [gets on his bike and rides off, only to fall on his face a few seconds later.] Aw!; All right, people. People, please! We need everyone to try and stay calm.; How can we stay calm while the President's out there scaring our children?!; Look, we all want the President out of here. It's just a matter of how we do it. I know you all want to get rid of him.; That's not true! The Whites still support the President; Oh, for fuck's sake, White, he's running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids!; You think Hillary would have been any better?!; Aw! Come on! Sit down, Bob!; [Sits down] I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'; Listen, everyone. I have a team right now that's trying to locate the President, and I'd like you to hear from Officer Bright, who's leading the search. [the officer adjusts his pants and walks up to the podium]; Hey folks, we know you're all uh concerned, but I wanna assure you that we're doing everything we can to track the President down and have him safely removed. Since the President was given a Splatty Tomato he's become very desperate and very dangerous. If you see the President, do not approach him. Do not try to reason with him. Most importantly, remember that this is the President, so you cannot shoot him. All right? You can't even talk about shooting him. Don't even... do any coy, satirical takes on shooting him. [the room stays silent] Okay, good. What we're trying to do here is just get the President to go away. We're gonna be handing out padlocks like this one [lifts one up for display] so everyone can lock up their garbage. If we don't feed the President, hopefully he'll just move on. Are there any questions?; Can we talk about a friend shooting him if it's in sort of a sarcastic way?; No, no, no. It's just best to avoid that kind of talk altogether. Remember, they can do to you what they did to Kathy Griffin.; Make her not funny for thirty years?; That's right, so best thing is just lock up your garbage and see if we can get the President to... go away.; Jesus. Now kids are going missing.; We're all going to be missing soon! Nyaaarg!; [notices Kyle across the street walking by] Kyle! [the kids walk up to him]; It's my fault. Ike went to go take matters into his own hands. I have to find him.; We'll help you.; We'll all help you.; Guys this could be very dangerous.; You're not going. You promised that tonight, we would have a date night.; Darling this is a little more pressing than date night.; Oh great.So Kyle's stupid brother goes missing, and I get fucked. How come I'm always the one getting shit on around here?; I don't need anyone to go with me.; Oh what's the matter, Kyle? Dont' want me around because you had the hots for me and I shut you down?; I would never have the hots for the person you are now.; Come on you guys. Look, we all know what we're supposed to do now We all saw ""It"" and ""Stranger Things"". We need to get our backpacks and go out to the woods and save the town from evil to some kick-ass '80s' music!; Hello, joing us for lunch today?; Uh, yes. We are here with our student of the day to reward him lunch with the principal and vice principal.; Okay, last name?; Woman.; First name?; [Takes a deep breath] Strong.; Oh, yes, Strong Woman, here we are. We have a nice booth set up for you.; We can't keep doing this. People are gonna see through it.; Is it my fault that I found the most amazing, perfect, beautiful woman...at work?; Nobody will understand.; Maybe they will. We're co-worker who are in love. You really think that's going to bother people?; Well, should we order now?; What are you doing, Bob?; Aah!; [Randy is joined by Steven, Linda, Sharon and Roger] Have you been putting food out for the president?; No, I was just, uh, taking these sandwiches to the trash.; We all agreed not to feed him so he'd go away.; We didn't all agree! You all agreed! Nobody asked the Whites how they felt! Nobody cares what the Whites have to say!; Bob come on. You have to know it's not safe to have him here.; In 2003, Hillary Clinton admitted to taking funds for her foundation from foreign diplomats!; What's that got to do with anything, Bob? Come on.; It's fucking true!; Bob, if Canada finds out the president is hiding here, they are going to nuke us. He needs to go.; Hillary wouldn't have been any better.; Give me the finger sandwiches.; Fine! Go ahead and take the White's sandwiches! They've taken everything else!; Due, this is '80's' music?; Yeah. It's Pandora. '80s' channel.; Well, just skip to the next song, man. We're trying to get psyched to destroy evil. We need better '80s' music than that.; Heidi? Honey, what are you doing?; This is the place... This is the place where I ended it all, remember? This is where I threw my phone of the bridge and quit Twitter for good. [The camera pans to the left to show Heidi's ghost] I was so different then... so naive and hopeful. [The ghost throws the phone in the river after tweeting her final goodbye]; Yes honey, now can we get going, please?; I'm sorry! I'm trying to have a moment here! This is where our whole relationship started asshole!; Yes, it's very touching, sweetheart. I love you so much. [Quietly] I'm sorry about this, you guys.; [The ghost turns to face herself] I remember feeling like I had nobody. Skinny bitch.; We need to keep going guys.; Don't tell me you haven't gotten the President out of here.; We haven't gotten the president out of here. And there's some worse news. A bunch of kids have gone missing.; What?; I think we have to assume that the President has... eaten them. [Mrs Tweak starts crying]; Why are you here talking to me instead of trying to find the President?; Don't worry, we're close. He's out in the woods somewhere. And we've set up a fox trap.; Oh, Fox News... They'll listen to me. They'll get my side of the story right!; [He does bird whistles to get Garrison's attention] It's a trap!; What?; It's a Fox trap, Mr. President!; Oh, thank God for the Whites.; Ike! Ike?; Dude, come on! This is not kick-ass '80s' music!; ""Hold On to the Nights"" Richard Marx, 1988.; Do we really need music?; Yeah! Craig just has the wrong stuff. Forget your pandora. I'm doing Spotify. '80s' music. 'Kay. There. [""Pac-Man Fever"" plays]; Oh, yeah. That's better.; Can we go please?!; Here it is. [Opens the door] Ike?; Wait a minute... Isn't this the place you brought me before? The place you said your friends smashed your phone and computer...? I remember I felt so bad for you. We used to sit in the part and talk for hours. How come we never do that anymore?; Oh, fuck. Here we go.; Here we go what?! You used to be so nice to me.; You used to be nice to me!; I tired! But then you started rolling your eyes every time I tried to talk to you!; Ughhhh...; He's not here either.; Dude, maybe your brother didn't even go looking for the President.; You don't understand Canadians. They're fiercely loyal to their country. When Canada is attacked, they all join in the fight.; Randy! Randy!; What?; They got him! They found the President!; We found his hideout. There. Someone's gotta go flush him out. I'll be ready to trap him.; I'll do it.; Hey, hey! Just remember he's been eating animals and living like a monster. Just... prepare yourself for what you're about to see.; Oh, my God!; What the... Principal and Vice Principal...?; I told you we couldn't hide.; But... But you two work togeth... You two work togeth... [Vomits]; Hey, what the hell's going on?!; Who's together?; The Principal and the Vice Principal!; They can't be together! They're co-workers!; Wait, wait. You mean he's actually her superior and they were in there... [Gags, then vomits]; Who would want to put their penis in a co-worker?! [Gags then vomits. Everyone else starts doing the same]; Oh, my God! Look! These are Ike's toy binoculars! He was here! Ike!; I remember this place too... This is where you brought me on Halloween. Remember?; [Sarcastically] Yes, darling, wasn't it romantic; No! It wasn't romantic. There was a witch and you had me dress up like Gretel and... [gasps] you were trying to get me killed!; Sweetheart, you made me late to the pumpkin patch, remember? I was hurt.; You were hurt! You Were the victim.; I'm glad you understand.; [Heidi's ghost appears] Who turned you into this, Heidi? Shut up! Skinny-ass bitch! You don't know anything!; Heidi, I think spooky walk in the woods is making you lost it a little bit.; Guys!; I'm seriously dehydrated and starving. I'm pretty sick of this shit, so you better... Aah!; Have we already done a search of this area? Maybe she went there with her boyfriend!; She would have called by now.; I just talked to the McKormicks. They haven't seen Tweek or Craig since yesterday.; Randy! Did you find anything?; [He takes off his hood] Sharon... I... I...; What is it? What did you find?; The... There's... Ugh...; Tell me! You have to tell me! [Officer Bright takes off his hat] Oh, God! What did you see?!; You don't want to know.; You have to tell me! I can take it! Did you find our son's arm? Did you find him torn apart? What?!; The Principal and Vice Principal are, like... together. [Sharon vomits right onto Randy's face.] Aw!; It's the President! [People begin to cheer]; Ike! Kyle!; Stan, you're okay!; Yeah, we're okay!; We got him. We got the son of a bitch. [Bob white walks over and grabs Officer Bright's gun]; Get back! Everyone back! Do it now! Get over here, family!; Bob, for the love of Pete, our country is about to go to war!; You wanna know where there's a war?! There's a war on Christmas! Nobody cares about that! 'Cos guess who loves Christmas? The Whites! At least this man's trying to save Christmas!; [Muffled] That's true!; He's not saving Christmas, Bob. He's running around scaring your kids and shitting in the woods.; [Sighs, sobs]; Come on, Bob. What's best for your daughter? I mean, really?; [Heidi grabs White's gun] You piece of shit! This was all your fault! [She points the gun at Cartman] You controlled me and manipulated me and turned me into this!; Baby, put down the guy, sweetheart, okay?; I used to be kind. I used to be caring. But then you... you... No. Not you. Me. I did this. I let being a victim become a way of life. If you always make yourself the victim, you can justify being awful. Eric... I'm sorry. I'm breaking up with you.; Honey, don't be ridiculous.; I've been ridiculous. I have to learn to stop feeling sorry for myself.; Heidi, you are not breaking up with me.; Yes, I am. It's over.; I'm afraid I can't let you do that, sweetheart! [He grabs the gun and points it at himself] Step back! I'll do it I swear to God!; It's not gonna work this time, Eric.; You break up with me, I will kill myself! The choice is your, Heidi! Come on everybody! ""Eric, we don't want you to die.""; I'm sorry. You can be the victim. I can't.; Heidi! Heidi, I'm gonna do it! Here we go! Heidi? Are you seriously...; He broke free!; The President is on the loose again.; He'll be even more desperate now. It's going to get worse.; We can't destroy him, can we?; I don't know. I guess... It's up to the Whites."
