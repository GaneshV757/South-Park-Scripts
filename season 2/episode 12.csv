0,2,12,Stan Marsh,Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.
1,2,12,Stan Marsh,Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.
2,2,12,Stan Marsh,American base is only a few feet away.
3,2,12,Eric Cartman,What is this? Halt!
4,2,12,Eric Cartman,It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
5,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!"
6,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! You're dead!
7,2,12,Eric Cartman,"I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--"
8,2,12,Stan Marsh,"No, you don't!"
9,2,12,Eric Cartman,"--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets."
10,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!"
11,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!"
12,2,12,Eric Cartman,That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
13,2,12,Eric Cartman,What?
14,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Well? Now what are we going to do?
15,2,12,Stan Marsh,Huh-I dunno.
16,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, Stan."
17,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Hi, Wendy."
18,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today?"
19,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,I dunno.
20,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,She does. She looks very pretty.
21,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
22,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, can I talk to you for a second?"
23,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?"
24,2,12,Stan Marsh,...No.
25,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace."
26,2,12,Stan Marsh,We could?
27,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, Stan."
28,2,12,Stan Marsh,"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse."
29,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
30,2,12,Stan Marsh,Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
31,2,12,Eric Cartman,Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk!
32,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Heellp!!)
33,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!"
34,2,12,Stan Marsh,[Intrigued.] Truth or Dare? Wow.
35,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do."
36,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,We do?
37,2,12,Stan Marsh,We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
38,2,12,Bebe Stevens,[To Wendy.] Did it work?
39,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend."
40,2,12,Bebe Stevens,I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
41,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Hey, Phillip, pull my finger."
42,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"All right, Terrance."
43,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder."
44,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Well, all right."
45,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Hurgh, urgh."
46,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!"
47,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,Okay.
48,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!"

51,2,12,Randy Marsh,Uh oh!
52,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!"
53,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Yes, I sure did!"
54,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip."
55,2,12,Randy Marsh,"No, I was just uh flipping through the channels."
56,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse."
57,2,12,Randy Marsh,Okay.
58,2,12,Stan Marsh,How do we do it?
59,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?"
60,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude! How'd you know?"
61,2,12,Randy Marsh,How do you think I met your mother?
62,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"[Walks in.] Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!"
63,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, brother."
64,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!"
65,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Stanley, you should know better."
66,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dude!
67,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot."
68,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?"
69,2,12,Randy Marsh,"[Resisting.] Okay, okay."
70,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy?"
71,2,12,Rudy,"Man, Fat Abbot, you need to lose weight!"
72,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho!"
73,2,12,Rudy,"Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!"
74,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
75,2,12,Stan Marsh,Sweet!
76,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo nigga ass, shithole!"
77,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!"
78,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Did you find it?
79,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Give me a second, would you?"
80,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Don't snap at me!
81,2,12,Randy Marsh,I didn't snap at you.
82,2,12,Sharon Marsh,You snapped at me!
83,2,12,Randy Marsh,Whatever.
84,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, ""whatever,"" to me!"
85,2,12,Randy Marsh,"I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry."
86,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"I'm sorry, too."
87,2,12,Randy Marsh,Uh I think I found it.
88,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"That's not it, you idiot!"
89,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, back off, bitch!"
90,2,12,Sharon Marsh,[Gasps.] You just said the C-word!
91,2,12,Randy Marsh,Did I?
92,2,12,Stan Marsh,This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
93,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?"
94,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play."
95,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass."
96,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?"
97,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,What? Why?
98,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs."
99,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
100,2,12,Eric Cartman,What are you guys doing?
101,2,12,Stan Marsh,We're building a clubhouse.
102,2,12,Eric Cartman,"[Laughs heartily.] A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!"
103,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!"
104,2,12,Eric Cartman,[Thinks it over.] Wwwhy??
105,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?"
106,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!"
107,2,12,Eric Cartman,That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
108,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Fine!
109,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!"
110,2,12,Stan Marsh,Fine!
111,2,12,Eric Cartman,Fine!
112,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Fine!
113,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Fine!)
114,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Fine!
115,2,12,Eric Cartman,Fine! That's fine.
116,2,12,Stan Marsh,Fine!
117,2,12,Eric Cartman,Fine!
118,2,12,Eric Cartman,"No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!"
119,2,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--)"
120,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker."
121,2,12,Kenny McCormick,[Still trying.] (Uh--)
122,2,12,Eric Cartman,"No, Kenny."
123,2,12,Liane Cartman,"[Stopping by.] How's the treehouse coming along, hon?"
124,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!"
125,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Sorry, hon."
126,2,12,Eric Cartman,Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
127,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare."
128,2,12,Eric Cartman,"[Sliding into a whine.] But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!"
129,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Well, all right."
130,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now."
131,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(You suck ass and you suck dick!)
132,2,12,Eric Cartman,And stop your bitchin'!
133,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"What are you doing, sweetheart?"
134,2,12,Stan Marsh,Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
135,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!"
136,2,12,Stan Marsh,'Kay.
137,2,12,Mr Garrison,"And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?"
138,2,12,Mr Twig,"Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--"
139,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,When is Mr. Hat coming back?
140,2,12,Mr Garrison,What did you say?!
141,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,When is Mr. Hat coming back?
142,2,12,Mr Garrison,"I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!"
143,2,12,Stan Marsh,But Mr. Twig sucks.
144,2,12,Class,Yeah.
145,2,12,Mr Garrison,"That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104..."
146,2,12,Eric Cartman,"So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?"
147,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Better than yours, fat boy."
148,2,12,Eric Cartman,"We'll see about that. [To Kenny.] Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny."
149,2,12,Kenny McCormick,"[Gruffly.] (Yes, sir..!)"
150,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,Is the clubhouse ready?
151,2,12,Stan Marsh,Almost.
152,2,12,Mr Garrison,Stan? Are you paying attention?
153,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yes, Mr. Garrison."
154,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?"
155,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings."
156,2,12,Mr Garrison,"...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention."
157,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh..."
158,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Good guess, dude!"
159,2,12,Stan Marsh,Phew.
160,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Pssst! Pass this up.
161,2,12,Butters Stotch,Pass this up.
162,2,12,Kevin Stoley,Pass this up.
163,2,12,Fosse McDonald,P-huh pass this h-up.
164,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!"
165,2,12,Stan Marsh,"No, I just--"
166,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile."
167,2,12,Stan Marsh,I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
168,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!"
169,2,12,Stan Marsh,But I didn't write the note!
170,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education."
171,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman!"
172,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!"
173,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, man."
174,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass.
I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you.
 I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity."
175,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude!"
176,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m'kay? Not for immature skylarkings."
177,2,12,Stan Marsh,What's 'skylarkings'?
178,2,12,Mr Mackey,"You know, like tomfooleries."
179,2,12,Stan Marsh,Who?
180,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Oh, your parents are here."
181,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no."
182,2,12,Mr Mackey,Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
183,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, I... Skylarkings?"
184,2,12,Mr Mackey,Yeahm'kay?
185,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
186,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
187,2,12,Stan Marsh,"It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's."
188,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder."
189,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"You really should know better, Stanley."
190,2,12,Randy Marsh,"You need to shape up, mister."
191,2,12,Sharon Marsh,[To Randy.] Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
192,2,12,Randy Marsh,[A bit testily.] I don't interrupt you.
193,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"There, you did it again! [To Mr. Mackey.] He interrupted me again."
194,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--"
195,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!"
196,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad."
197,2,12,Sharon Marsh,[To Randy.] Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
198,2,12,Mr Mackey,[Slowly.] Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
199,2,12,Randy Marsh,When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
200,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling."
201,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say."
202,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--"
203,2,12,Stan Marsh,Excuse me.
204,2,12,Mr Mackey,-how do you feel?
205,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
206,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, please!"
207,2,12,Stan Marsh,Hello?
208,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, please yourself!"
209,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?"
210,2,12,Sharon Marsh,He is.
211,2,12,Randy Marsh,"No, she is."
212,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again!"
213,2,12,Mr Mackey,Mmkay.
214,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built."
215,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man!"
216,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh)
217,2,12,Eric Cartman,"And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny."
218,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
219,2,12,Eric Cartman,"All right. You go find chicks, Kenny."
220,2,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)"
221,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!"
222,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?"
223,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
224,2,12,Stan Marsh,I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
225,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,To me??
226,2,12,Stan Marsh,"I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!"
227,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We should use nails, dude."
228,2,12,Stan Marsh,My mom won't let us.
229,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?"
230,2,12,Stan Marsh,Pretty good. We're almost done.
231,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!"
232,2,12,Stan Marsh,We're going as fast as we can!
233,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Kyle, could you turn around for a second?"
234,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Thank you.
235,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster."
236,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?"
237,2,12,Stan Marsh,No.
238,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?"
239,2,12,Stan Marsh,I didn't even think about that.
240,2,12,Chef,"And then, they'll ask, ""Truth or Dare?'"
241,2,12,Stan Marsh,"And I say, ""Dare!"""
242,2,12,Chef,"No no! You say, ""Truth."""
243,2,12,Stan Marsh,"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her."
244,2,12,Chef,"You have to say ""Truth"" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager."
245,2,12,Stan Marsh,Oooh.
246,2,12,Chef,"You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens."
247,2,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
248,2,12,Chef,"Then, after a few ""Truth""s, you finally answer, ""Dare."""
249,2,12,Stan Marsh,"""Dare!"""
250,2,12,Chef,"But not like that, son. Like this: ""Daaare""."
251,2,12,Stan Marsh,Oooh.
252,2,12,Chef,And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
253,2,12,Stan Marsh,You really think so?
254,2,12,Chef,Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
255,2,12,Stan Marsh,Wow!
256,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?"
257,2,12,Rudy,"Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?"
258,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"You know somethin', Rudy? You're like school in summertime."
259,2,12,Rudy,School in summertime?
260,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Yeah, bitch, school in summertime!"
261,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Open yo' fuckin' ears and shit, ho, or I'll pop your bitch ass."
262,2,12,Donald,"I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha."
263,2,12,Eric Cartman,What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
264,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?"
265,2,12,Kenny McCormick,"[Proudly, with thumbs up.] (Uh-huh)"
266,2,12,Blonde,Hi. We ran away from home.
267,2,12,Brunette,"Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days."
268,2,12,Eric Cartman,[Amazed.] Holy crap!
269,2,12,Eric Cartman,Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
270,2,12,Blonde,"Oh well, I guess it beats living at home."
271,2,12,Eric Cartman,[Enunciating properly.] Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? [Rubs his stomach.]
272,2,12,Stan Marsh,Hello?
273,2,12,Eric Cartman,"How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?"
274,2,12,Stan Marsh,We're working on it.
275,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over."
276,2,12,Stan Marsh,"No, you don't!"
277,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dude!
278,2,12,Eric Cartman,"It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole."
279,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Aw, that hunk of fat-- [Sharon walks in.] Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?"
280,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out."
281,2,12,Stan Marsh,What?! Why?
282,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Because, we're divorced, Stanley."
283,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?"
284,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, kind of."
285,2,12,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!"
286,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy."
287,2,12,Roy,"Hello, son."
288,2,12,Stan Marsh,What?!
289,2,12,Sharon Marsh,I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.
290,2,12,Roy,"Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me."
291,2,12,Stan Marsh,This is happening way too fast.
292,2,12,Roy,"Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!"
293,2,12,Blonde,"So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, ""Make sure you're home before midnight!"""
294,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Ahaw, that's weak."
295,2,12,Blonde,"And I go, ""Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"""
296,2,12,Eric Cartman,That's killer.
297,2,12,Blonde,"And she goes, ""Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"""
298,2,12,Eric Cartman,That's totally weak!
299,2,12,Blonde,"So I go, ""Fine! I won't come home!"""
300,2,12,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
301,2,12,Blonde,"And then she goes, ""Fine! Don't come home!"", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap."
302,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Killer weak, sweet!"
303,2,12,Blonde,I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.
304,2,12,Blonde,I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
305,2,12,Eric Cartman,"I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"""
306,2,12,Stan Marsh,Okay. We're done.
307,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[Wiggling the railing.] Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy."
308,2,12,Stan Marsh,"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls."
309,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
310,2,12,Stan Marsh,G'oh?
311,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, it's time to go!"
312,2,12,Stan Marsh,Go where?
313,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you."
314,2,12,Stan Marsh,But no! I have to get the girls to come-
315,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Come on, Stanley!"
316,2,12,Stan Marsh,Weak!
317,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dad?
318,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in."
319,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up."
320,2,12,Stan Marsh,But I don't understand why we have to--
321,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, hello, ladies."
322,2,12,Blonde Female Passenger,"Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight."
323,2,12,Randy Marsh,[Suavely.] I'm already there.
324,2,12,Randy Marsh,"What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more."
325,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?"
326,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what."
327,2,12,Stan Marsh,But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?
328,2,12,Stan Marsh,"You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister."
329,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it."
330,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, anyway, have a nice day."
331,2,12,Stan Marsh,What? That's it?
332,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out."
333,2,12,Randy Marsh,"You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?"
334,2,12,Stan Marsh,"I guess, but--"
335,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute."
336,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls."
337,2,12,Stan Marsh,"No way, dude! Don't be silly."
338,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"[Off screen.] Come on, Wendy."
339,2,12,Stan Marsh,"We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?"
340,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Right. Why?
341,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager."
342,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Too eager to what?
343,2,12,Stan Marsh,"To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez."
344,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"[Entering the clubhouse.] Hi, guys."
345,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?"
346,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Don't you guys still wanna play ""Truth or Dare""?"
347,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever."
348,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Then come on!
349,2,12,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle, softly.] Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times."
350,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
351,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Who wants to go first?
352,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,I will. Kyle?
353,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah?
354,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,Truth or Dare?
355,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Umm. Dare?
356,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dude!
357,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,What?
358,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,[Whispers.] How about we give him Bebe?
359,2,12,Bebe Stevens,[Whispers.] Okay.
360,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,[Whispers.] Okay.
361,2,12,Bebe Stevens,[Whispers.] Okay.
362,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,Kiss Bebe on the lips!
363,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!"
364,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"What's the matter, Kyle?"
365,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"It's just wrong, that's all."
366,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes."
367,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell have you gotten me into?!
368,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?"
369,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hoh boy.
370,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Sick!
371,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!
372,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"[Staring at him as he leaves.] Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!"
373,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Your turn, Bebe."
374,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"[Seated back by Wendy.] Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?"
375,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Stan, Truth or Dare?"
376,2,12,Stan Marsh,[Sensually.] Dare.
377,2,12,Roy,"Son, could you please help me with the firewood?"
378,2,12,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!"
379,2,12,Roy,"When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me."
380,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow."
381,2,12,Stan Marsh,Crap!
382,2,12,Blonde,I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
383,2,12,Brunette,[Pulls out a cigarette.] Our moms won't even let us smoke.
384,2,12,Blonde,"Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it."
385,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!"
386,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night."
387,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?"
388,2,12,Eric Cartman,"[Voice shaking.] Coming, Mom. [To the girls.] Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!"
389,2,12,Guy in Leather Jacket,"Hey, girls."
390,2,12,Guy with Long Hair,What's up.
391,2,12,Blonde,"Oh hey, Scott."
392,2,12,Eric Cartman,Who the hell are you?!
393,2,12,Brunette,Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
394,2,12,Eric Cartman,How many people?
395,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Kyle, can I talk to you?"
396,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
397,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart."
398,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
399,2,12,Bebe Stevens,I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
400,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, that's fine."
401,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way."
402,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,[Muffled.] But I don't care.
403,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.
404,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Okay, Clyde, we can go now."
405,2,12,Clyde Donovan,Bitchin'.
406,2,12,Host,"These are café curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that!"
407,2,12,Stan Marsh,Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
408,2,12,Roy,Nnuuhunuuhh.
409,2,12,Stan Marsh,What?
410,2,12,Roy,Chores. Do chores.
411,2,12,Stan Marsh,My dad lets me watch cartoons.
412,2,12,Roy,Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm not your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions.
413,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"[Arms on her hips.] Stanley, what did you do to Roy?"
414,2,12,Stan Marsh,Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
415,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"[Sighs.] Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?"
416,2,12,Stan Marsh,"If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!"
417,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, ""you're the most important thing to me,"" what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances."
418,2,12,Stan Marsh,Oh.
419,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Bye now. Roy!
420,2,12,Stan Marsh,Divorce is stupid.
421,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?
422,2,12,Yolanda,"Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye."
423,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!
424,2,12,Yolanda,Really?
425,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I'm sayin'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin' shit! Damn!"
426,2,12,Yolanda,"You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!"
427,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!"
428,2,12,Bill,"Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding."
429,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy."
430,2,12,Older kid,"Hey, kid, give me some of those!"
431,2,12,Eric Cartman,Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
432,2,12,Blonde,What? That game's for kids.
433,2,12,Eric Cartman,This is bullcrap!
434,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party."
435,2,12,Eric Cartman,"This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!"
436,2,12,Punk,Mosh pit!
437,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Huh?)
438,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
439,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
440,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?
441,2,12,Roy,"Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of Harper's?"
442,2,12,Roy,Meet me at the clubhouse.
443,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Randy. What are you doing here?"
444,2,12,Randy Marsh,"I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse."
445,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Oh I thought that note was for me.
446,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, maybe it was."
447,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here."
448,2,12,Randy Marsh,I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
449,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Goodnight.
450,2,12,Randy Marsh,Sharon?
451,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Yes?
452,2,12,Randy Marsh,Truth or Dare?
453,2,12,Sharon Marsh,It's too late for games.
454,2,12,Randy Marsh,"No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?"
455,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Truth.
456,2,12,Randy Marsh,Do you still love me?
457,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him."
458,2,12,Roy,Sharon--
459,2,12,Roy,Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
460,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, you never know. Maybe--"
461,2,12,Roy,He-
462,2,12,Randy Marsh,--thing will work out.
463,2,12,Roy,Hello?
464,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
465,2,12,Roy,Sharon?
466,2,12,Randy Marsh,[Sensually.] Dare.
467,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Do me. Right here in the clubhouse.
468,2,12,Roy,Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
469,2,12,Stan Marsh,Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
470,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
471,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dare.
472,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
473,2,12,Stan Marsh,...What?!
474,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Wow, that sucks!"
475,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Do you think it'll hurt?
476,2,12,Roy,"Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?"
