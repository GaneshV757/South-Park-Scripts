0,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus."
1,2,3,Eric Cartman,[To Kyle.] Reading sucks ass.
2,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Eric, shut up! [Eric looks up.]"
3,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
4,2,3,Stan Marsh,[At the next stack.] Hey you guys. Check out these books. [They come over.] Sabrina Unchained.
5,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, these books look cool!"
6,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books."
7,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
8,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Stops by.] Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading."
9,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Who are you?
10,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading."
11,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[Irritated.] God, shut up, dude."
12,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic. [He floats away.]
13,2,3,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?"
14,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical."
15,2,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these."
16,2,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, what's that?)"
17,2,3,Stan Marsh,I don't know. Let's go see.
18,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong."
19,2,3,Dispatcher 1,[Through intercom.] All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation.
20,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town!"
21,2,3,Dispatcher,"And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home."
22,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Goddammit!
23,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here. [To the rancher.] What's the trouble? Where's the body?"
24,2,3,Rancher,"Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens."
25,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Uhhhh... oh.
26,2,3,Woman,"My God, that's disgusting!"
27,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?"
28,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see. [To the rancher.] Did you get a good look at the suspect?"
29,2,3,Rancher,"Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast."
30,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?"
31,2,3,Cameraman,"Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond."
32,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Haw, camel poo."
33,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what's this?"
34,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,It looks like a note.
35,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Give me that! [Takes the note.] That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!"
36,2,3,Rancher,[Coming over.] What does it say?
37,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uhh... It says, uuh, ""Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye."" Well, there you have it. Case closed."
38,2,3,Rancher,"Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say ""Nothin' to see here"", and ""Case closed."" But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!"
39,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people."
40,2,3,Rancher,For what? Orderly conduct?
41,2,3,Officer Barbrady,How about fishing without a license?
42,2,3,Rancher,I'm not fishin'.
43,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Whataya call this then?
44,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you... [Pulls out his gun.] by gunshot to the head."
45,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"That's right, return to your simple lives. [Puts his gun away] Just forget this ever happened. Forget."
46,2,3,Officer Barbrady,For-get.
47,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
48,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wonder what's wrong."
49,2,3,Teller,Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?
50,2,3,Teller,"Sir, can I help you?"
51,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalape√±o poppers."
52,2,3,Teller,"Sure, there's just one problem."
53,2,3,Officer Barbrady,What's that?
54,2,3,Teller,We're a bank.
55,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?"
56,2,3,Teller,Yes.
57,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Hmmm. [Drives away.] I can't go on living this lie!
58,2,3,Anchor,"With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions."
59,2,3,Reporter 1,"Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?"
60,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established."
61,2,3,Reporter 2,Do the police have any leads?
62,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet."
63,2,3,Reporter 3,But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?
64,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"All right, all right! I can't read!"
65,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!"
66,2,3,Press Coordinator,"Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front."
67,2,3,Anchor,"And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--"
68,2,3,Anchor,This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!
69,2,3,Anchor,"Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town!"
70,2,3,Looter 1,"Whoopee, this is killer!"
71,2,3,Looter 2,"With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!"
72,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude, what's going on?"
73,2,3,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
74,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed--"
75,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, never mind."
76,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful."
77,2,3,Aide 1,Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
78,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,He is.
79,2,3,Reporter 3,What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?
80,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
81,2,3,Reporter 3,But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?
82,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--"
83,2,3,Aide 2,"Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately."
84,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!"
85,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady."
86,2,3,Stan Marsh,"I can't see, dude!"
87,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics."
88,2,3,Mr Garrison,"E-yes, what is it?"
89,2,3,Officer Barbrady,I need to go poopies.
90,2,3,Mr Garrison,"[Pause.] Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class."
91,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?"
92,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?"
93,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,How about a brain transplant?
94,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it."
95,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady."
96,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Ahhh... O... O--
97,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha [Slaps his thigh.] hahahaha! [Wipes his forehead.] Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones."
98,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared."
99,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Ahhh... O...
100,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?"
101,2,3,Mr Hat,"I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard!"
102,2,3,Officer Barbrady,[To the children] Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
103,2,3,Stan Marsh,"No, we just fake it to shut him up."
104,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again."
105,2,3,Intruder,"So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this?"
106,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports."
107,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see..."
108,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[In falsetto.] Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?"
109,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Eric, why don't you go first?"
110,2,3,Eric Cartman,Oooaaagh.
111,2,3,Mr Garrison,"What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?"
112,2,3,Eric Cartman,I'm prepared!
113,2,3,Eric Cartman,"For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?"
114,2,3,Mr Garrison,"No, I can't say that I have."
115,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus."
116,2,3,Mr Garrison,"And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!"
117,2,3,Eric Cartman,God-dammit!
118,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
119,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?"
120,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: ""Big... dog..., little... dog. [Turns the page.] A red dog... on a..."" Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life."
121,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A."
122,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Hooray!
123,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Miffed.] Goody two-shoes.
124,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
""Whoosh!"" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes"
125,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much."
126,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?"
127,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go..."
128,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!"
129,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(Daaarrrggghh--)
130,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(-ooggghhh...)
131,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, my God! They've killed--"
132,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hey.)
133,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, never mind. [Smiles.]"
134,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, how's the reading coming along?"
135,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"[Wringing his hands.] Oooh, pretty good."
136,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night."
137,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no!.
138,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover."
139,2,3,Aide 2,This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.
140,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
141,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene.
142,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's."
143,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"[Throttling him.] You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!"
144,2,3,Officer Barbrady,I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
145,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!"
146,2,3,Aide 2,"Hey, what'd you do that for?"
147,2,3,Aide 1,"Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry. [They leave.]"
148,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh boy, I'm in big trouble."
149,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos."
150,2,3,Stan Marsh,"It's cool, dude. We'll help you."
151,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis."
152,2,3,Eric Cartman,Really? I wanna be a cop.
153,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset."
154,2,3,Eric Cartman,Do I get a nightstick?
155,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Sure, nightsticks for everybody!"
156,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case."
157,2,3,Eric Cartman,"10-4, sergeant! [Walks off.]"
158,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Now, what did that clue say again?"
159,2,3,Stan Marsh,"""If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft""."
160,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!"
161,2,3,Stan Marsh,Hooray!
162,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Hooray!
163,2,3,Kenny McCormick,Hooray!
164,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading."
165,2,3,Officer Barbrady,We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
166,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous--"
167,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake!"
168,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,What's it say?
169,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"It says, ""Mmmuh mmmuuh..."" Uh, what's this word? [Points out to Stan.]"
170,2,3,Stan Marsh,I.
171,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, yeah. ""I... mmuh mmuh--"""
172,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Here, give me that. [Takes the book.] ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."""
173,2,3,Stan Marsh,"A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond."
174,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!"
175,2,3,Eric Cartman,Ey!
176,2,3,Randy Marsh,"Uhh, yes, Officer?"
177,2,3,Eric Cartman,I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
178,2,3,Randy Marsh,"Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour."
179,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Step out of the car, please, sir."
180,2,3,Randy Marsh,Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
181,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[Slower.] Sir, step out of the car, please."
182,2,3,Randy Marsh,[Steps out.] Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
183,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!"
184,2,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy."
185,2,3,Randy Marsh,Ow!
186,2,3,Eric Cartman,Get your ass to jail!
187,2,3,Randy Marsh,"Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!"
188,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Getting carried away.] Sweet.
189,2,3,Randy Marsh,Ooww!
190,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!"
191,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind."
192,2,3,Father Maxi,"Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?"
193,2,3,Halfy,[Mischievously.] I would. [Everyone looks at him.]
194,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!"
195,2,3,Halfy,Oh... yeah. [He moves away on his fists.]
196,2,3,Father Maxi,"Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?!"
197,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue."
198,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Here! Here, I found one!"
199,2,3,Stan Marsh,What's it say? What's it say?
200,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?"
201,2,3,Stan Marsh,I dunno.
202,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"[Taking the note.] ""Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist."" [Everybody cheers.] I read it! I read it all by myself! [Grins.]"
203,2,3,Halfy,"[Doing flips.] Hooray, yeah! Whoo!"
204,2,3,Dispatcher 2,Five George is en route to 496 Broad Wasteland...
205,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you. [The camera checks out traffic.] Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them."
206,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Winking.] Hi there, little lady."
207,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, hi there."
208,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?"
209,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?"
210,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car, please."
211,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Stammers.] What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?"
212,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[Displays his badge.] Sir, step out of the car."
213,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Stepping out.] Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!"
214,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Pulls out his baton.] Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.
215,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!"
216,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Exhales.] Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
217,2,3,Looter 3,I got a TV.
218,2,3,Looter 4,Shh. Come on!
219,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"[Reading from the book.] ""Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..."" Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!"
220,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"How's it goin', dude?"
221,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo."
222,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude, it's not that hard!"
223,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"It is, too!"
224,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Just read the sentence.
225,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"""Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"""
226,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dumbass, you can do it!"
227,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"""Pet--"" Wait a minute. [Recalls Garrison.]"
228,2,3,Mr Garrison,Conjugate the verb. Conjugate the verb.
229,2,3,Mr Hat,"Yes, conjugate the verb."
230,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!"
231,2,3,Dispatcher 3,"All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance."
232,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Sir, could you step out of the car, please?"
233,2,3,Stuart McCormick,"We're fine, officer. [Sips his beer.]"
234,2,3,Eric Cartman,"And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?"
235,2,3,Stuart McCormick,Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids--
236,2,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hi, Cartman.)"
237,2,3,Stuart McCormick,"--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year."
238,2,3,Eric Cartman,[To the camera.] Poor people tend to live in clusters.
239,2,3,Stuart McCormick,[Takes a swig of beer.] What‚ÄîWhat did you say?
240,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a..."
241,2,3,Mrs McCormick,I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
242,2,3,Stuart McCormick,"Shut up, bitch!"
243,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh."
244,2,3,Mrs McCormick,You lazy-ass motherfucker!
245,2,3,Stuart McCormick,Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
246,2,3,Mrs McCormick,I'll do it again!
247,2,3,Kevin McCormick,Mom hit Dad again!
248,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!"
249,2,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Goddammit, Cartman!)"
250,2,3,Stuart McCormick,Aagh!
251,2,3,Dispatcher 1,All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
252,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[Stops, gasps.] Chickenlover!"
253,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute."
254,2,3,Stan Marsh,Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
255,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, maybe you read it wrong."
256,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, no!"
257,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Shhh!
258,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Keep your eyes peeled.
259,2,3,Stan Marsh,Look!
260,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,He's here!
261,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Grab him!
262,2,3,Eric Cartman,Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
263,2,3,Stan Marsh,"[Gasps.] Oh my God, they've killed--"
264,2,3,Kenny McCormick,"[Gets up.] (Oh, it was only my jacket.)"
265,2,3,Stan Marsh,Goddammit!
266,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!"
267,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Aw, I think that's a mask, dude."
268,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Oh.
269,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!"
270,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Caught you red-handed!
271,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?"
272,2,3,Officer Barbrady,By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.
273,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly! [Pleased.]
274,2,3,Stan Marsh,"What are you talking about, dude?!"
275,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!"
276,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
277,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate."
278,2,3,Stan Marsh,"That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude."
279,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!"
280,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.
281,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I guess I should say ""Thanks?"""
282,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand."
283,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Rushing up.] Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
284,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
285,2,3,Eric Cartman,I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
286,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens."
287,2,3,Eric Cartman,A-ha!
288,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Ow, that hurts!"
289,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
290,2,3,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
291,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"No, no, that's not how you uphold the law! [He puts him down.]"
292,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!"
293,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this: [Paf.]"
294,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Going down, squealing.] Heee--!"
295,2,3,Officer Barbrady,You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
296,2,3,Eric Cartman,Ooohhhh.
297,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?"
298,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job!"
299,2,3,Stan Kyle,Hooray!
300,2,3,Stan Marsh,Hey! So what are you going to do now?
301,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Now? [Turns around.] Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book."
302,2,3,Anchor,And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.
303,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
304,2,3,Man 1,Speech! Speech!
305,2,3,Officer Barbrady,[Lowers his arms.] What?
306,2,3,Stan Marsh,"They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days."
307,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious."
308,2,3,Man 2,"Oh, yeah!"
309,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered! [More cheering.] And finally, I'd like to say that [Enunciating.] reading totally sucks ass!"
310,2,3,Stan Kyle,Hooray!
311,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!"
312,2,3,Stan Marsh,Hooray for Barbrady!
313,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Hooray for Barbrady!
314,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
315,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys."
316,2,3,Stan Marsh,"I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back."
317,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,It's poetic justice.
318,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"[Leaning forward.] Thanks, boys."
319,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(Ow!)
