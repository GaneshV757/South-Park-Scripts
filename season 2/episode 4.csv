0,2,4,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey."
1,2,4,Stan Marsh,[Imitating the counselor] Booooo!
2,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Nuh-now, who was that?"
3,2,4,Mr Mackey,"That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?"
4,2,4,Stan Marsh,"[Mimicking] I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
5,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again."
6,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Following Stan's lead.] We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
7,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh, okay, okay, that's fine."
8,2,4,Eric Cartman,M'kay?
9,2,4,Mr Mackey,"M'kay. [More laughs.] Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad."
10,2,4,Mr Mackey,"You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad."
11,2,4,Mr Mackey,"You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?"
12,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Yes, Stan?"
13,2,4,Stan Marsh,Why do dogs have cold noses?
14,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uhhh, well, I'm not sure."
15,2,4,Stan Marsh,Oh.
16,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana."
17,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,"
18,2,4,Mr Mackey,"...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,"
19,2,4,Mr Mackey,"...and when it gets back up to me,"
20,2,4,Mr Mackey,"...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you..."
21,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?"
22,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?"
23,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's his bris."
24,2,4,Eric Cartman,"What the hell is a ""bris""?"
25,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band."
26,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!"
27,2,4,Mr Mackey,"...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?"
28,2,4,Mr Mackey,No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.
29,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney..."
30,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?"
31,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Uhhh... I'm not sure.
32,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, dude, you better find out!"
33,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Boys, are you paying attention?"
34,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
35,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?"
36,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?"
37,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?"
38,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uh-oh.
39,2,4,Principal Victoria,"I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? [Thumps the desk.]"
40,2,4,Mr Mackey,"I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria."
41,2,4,Principal Victoria,"We-hell, ""sorry"" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school."
42,2,4,Mr Mackey,You mean I'm fired?
43,2,4,Principal Victoria,"Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes."
44,2,4,Mr Mackey,"But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--"
45,2,4,Principal Victoria,"It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty."
46,2,4,Mr Mackey,But--
47,2,4,Principal Victoria,"We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!"
48,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-[Sniff.]m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??"
49,2,4,Principal Victoria,"There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff."
50,2,4,Mr Mackey,[Sobbing.] No-uho-uho-uho! [Sniff.] Not o-uho-uhokay!
51,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Man! That sucked, getting searched."
52,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, my ass is killing me."
53,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
54,2,4,Eric Cartman,I wonder who took it.
55,2,4,Announcer,And now it's almost time for BoBo's.
56,2,4,Chef,"Hello there, children."
57,2,4,Boys,"Hey, Chef."
58,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,How's it going?
59,2,4,Chef,Bad.
60,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Why bad?
61,2,4,Chef,"Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?"
62,2,4,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, we never even saw it!"
63,2,4,Chef,Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
64,2,4,Stan Marsh,"We know, we know, that's what everybody says."
65,2,4,Chef,Right. But do you know why they're bad?
66,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits."
67,2,4,Chef,And do you have any idea what that means?
68,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,No.
69,2,4,Eric Cartman,"I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck."
70,2,4,Chef,"Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?"
71,2,4,Boys,Dude!
72,2,4,Chef,Okay. [Starts to move.]
73,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?"
74,2,4,Chef,"[Stops.] Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!"
75,2,4,Stan Marsh,What do ya mean?
76,2,4,Chef,Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
77,2,4,Eric Cartman,Wo-what's that?
78,2,4,Chef,Oh boy. Here we go again.
79,2,4,Chef,Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
80,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Ahhh, bicycles?"
81,2,4,Eric Cartman,Ham?
82,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No, not ham, you fat fuck!"
83,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?"
84,2,4,Chef,"No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body."
85,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Your heart?
86,2,4,Stan Marsh,Your eyes?
87,2,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Ooh, the penis!)"
88,2,4,Chef,That's right.
89,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman."
90,2,4,Chef,"A ""fireman""?"
91,2,4,Eric Cartman,"That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking."
92,2,4,Chef,"Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?"
93,2,4,Chef,Ask your parents for once!
94,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, wait!"
95,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good."
96,2,4,Female passenger,"Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha!"
97,2,4,Mr Allen,"Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common, d'oh-pe! [Peels away.] Ha ha ha ha!"
98,2,4,Driver 2,"Heeey, Mackey!"
99,2,4,Driver 3,"Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road?"
100,2,4,Driver 3 s Passenger,"Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike!"
101,2,4,Driver 4,Won't you leave the guy alone?
102,2,4,Driver 5,"Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs?"
103,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uuuuuugh!
104,2,4,Bartender,"Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before."
105,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job."
106,2,4,Bartender,"Oh that's weak, man. You know what you need? You need a good, stiff drink."
107,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?"
108,2,4,Bartender,"Trust me, man! It'll make you feel better."
109,2,4,Mr Mackey,Ughuh... [To himself.] Drinkin's bad.

 Angel Mackey","[Poof.] Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a beer. Don't be such a pussy, m'kay?"
112,2,4,Bartender,So how do you feel?
113,2,4,Mr Mackey,"[Burp] Woah, about the same."
114,2,4,Bartender,"Oh, you just need something a little stronger."
115,2,4,Stan Marsh,[Rushing up.] Kyle! You have to stop them!
116,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Stop who?
117,2,4,Stan Marsh,Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
118,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?
119,2,4,Stan Marsh,They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
120,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
121,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!"
122,2,4,Eric Cartman,Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
123,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
124,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris."
125,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!"
126,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad!

Heartache to heartache we stand, m'kay?
No promises, no demands, m-m'kay..?"
128,2,4,Mr Mackey,Whoa... Is this my house?
129,2,4,Landlord,"[Smoking a cigar.] Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey! I changed the locks!"
130,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Why, Mr. Freely?"
131,2,4,Mr Freely,I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children!
132,2,4,Mr Mackey,"No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that."
133,2,4,Mr Freely,"Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer!"
134,2,4,Mr Mackey,But I've never taken drugs either.
135,2,4,Mr Freely,"I've never taken drugs, and look at me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my property before I lose control and kill you!"
136,2,4,Mr Mackey,Huuhh?
137,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Ow, m'kay?!"
138,2,4,Mr Freely,Drug user! Druuug user!
139,2,4,Mr Mackey,"[Struggles to get up.] Uh, uh--"

145,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
146,2,4,Eric Cartman,What the hell is gahekgafuga?
147,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?"
148,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,To celebrate your little brother's [Ike claps.] passage into life.

150,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,Meaning we're going to circumcise him. [Kyle gasps.]
151,2,4,Eric Cartman,They are gonna cut off his fireman!
152,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"It's Jewish tradition, bubbe."
153,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--"
154,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!

164,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!
165,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Ike!"
166,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
167,2,4,Eric Cartman,"No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!"
168,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!"
169,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?"
170,2,4,Hobo,"Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?"
171,2,4,Mr Mackey,"[Startled.] Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken."
172,2,4,Hobo,"[Holds out a joint.] Here, try this; it'll warm you up."
173,2,4,Mr Mackey,Marijuwana's bad.
174,2,4,Hobo,What?
175,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?"

182,2,4,Hobo,"Ohh, boy."
183,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Ike, hurry up! [Ike babbles.] Where is the next train going?"
184,2,4,Train Station Clerk,"Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes."
185,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?"
186,2,4,Ike Broflovski,No!
187,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I need one ticket for my little brother.
188,2,4,Train Station Clerk,That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
189,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
190,2,4,Train Station Clerk,"I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train."
191,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
192,2,4,Train Station Clerk,What?! Why the hell would they do that?
193,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses."
194,2,4,Train Station Clerk,"No can do, sonny."
195,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dammit!
196,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train."

201,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Oh, man, where am I?"
202,2,4,Teen 1,"Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey."
203,2,4,Teen 2,"Wow, dude."
204,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?"
205,2,4,Teen 1,"Pretty good, man. How are you?"
206,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs."
207,2,4,Teen 1,"Hey! Us, too!"
208,2,4,Teen 2,"Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended."
209,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?"
210,2,4,Teen 1,"Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight."
211,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm..."
212,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?"
213,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, baby... The world is so small."
214,2,4,Mr Mackey,I'm free... I'm free...

216,2,4,Teen 1,That guy's totally trippin'.
217,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"There, what do you think?"
218,2,4,Eric Cartman,What the hell is that supposed to be?
219,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner."
220,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike."
221,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.
222,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No, go away! Bad dog!"
223,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what did you make that doll out of?"
224,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
225,2,4,Eric Cartman,Is that why it stinks so bad?
226,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Hi, boys."
227,2,4,Boys,"Hi, Mr. Mackey."
228,2,4,Mr Mackey,Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?
229,2,4,Boys,Yes.
230,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while."
231,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone."
232,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Knock it off, asshole!"
233,2,4,Eric Cartman,No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
234,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you."
235,2,4,Eric Cartman,Eech.

244,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Doing Ike.] Bye-bye seeme mama. [As himself.] Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up."

261,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?"
262,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted."
263,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,What??
264,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. [He starts to sob]"
265,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!"
266,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,What are you talking about?
267,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!"
268,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,What-what-whaaat?!
269,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!"
270,2,4,Eric Cartman,Fireman!
271,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility."
272,2,4,Kenny McCormick,(Hey!)

274,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
275,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,[Flatly] You bastards!
276,2,4,Father Maxi,"[Removes kippah and scarf.] ""Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."""
277,2,4,Jimbo Kern,"Get outta the way, you damn hippie!"
278,2,4,Mr Mackey,[Annoyed] I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit!
279,2,4,Jimbo Kern,What?
280,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?"

286,2,4,Mr Mackey,"[Getting mellow.] Sure, man. Finger-paintin's cool, m'kay?"
287,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Now, where did you leave him, young man?"
288,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, how the hell should I know?"
289,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son!
290,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass."
291,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!"
292,2,4,Shiela,"Ike, love?"
293,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Grousing.] All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother."
294,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother."
295,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, right."
296,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy."
297,2,4,Train Station Clerk,"Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar."
298,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,[Gasps.] Come on!
299,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,Ike!
300,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Mamatoedoe.
301,2,4,Barkeep,"Hey, lady, that's my table post! You can't have that!"
302,2,4,"Mr. Mackey
 Devil Mackey
 Angel Mackey","Wow, man. You know, it's like… You go through life thinking that you're an individual, m'kay? And then you realize that you're more than that, m'kay. We're all just one big individual, m'kay?"
303,2,4,Blonde,Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India.
304,2,4,"Mr. Mackey
 Devil Mackey
 Angel Mackey",[Gives it some thought.] M'kay.
305,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!"
306,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"But first, apologize to your brother!"
307,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,[Pointing at Ike.] He's not my brother!
308,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,Apologize to him!
309,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Angrily.] I'm sorry, Ike."
310,2,4,Ike Broflovski,"Uh oh, stufid."

 Angel Mackey",[A dove alights on his right arm.] I am one with the animals. And the trees.
313,2,4,Blonde,And I am one with you. [They reach for each other.]

A true reason to be
Now I feel I can start anew--"

318,2,4,"Mr. Mackey
 Devil Mackey
 Angel Mackey","[As Mr. T tosses him into the A-Team van.] Yeah I got, m'kay?"
319,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
320,2,4,Jimbo Kern,"Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab."
321,2,4,Mr Mackey,I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
322,2,4,Principal Victoria,"We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help."
323,2,4,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need."
324,2,4,Mr Mackey,I don't want help!
325,2,4,Principal Victoria,You'll thank us later.
326,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris."
327,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Uh oh.
328,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!"
329,2,4,Uncle Murray,"Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?"
330,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted."
331,2,4,Guest,Hi there!
332,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,Hello. Do I know you?
333,2,4,Guest,"Uh-no, but I never miss a bris. Here, I brought some dip. [Gives it to her.]"
334,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Ohhh, thanks."
335,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence."
336,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Oh deh family nrr.
337,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,What do you want?!
338,2,4,Ike Broflovski,I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr.
339,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!"
340,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude."
341,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
342,2,4,Ike Broflovski,"Cookie Monster, [flips some pages] two, three, four, five."
343,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!"
344,2,4,Ike Broflovski,[Now sporting one of Kyle's caps.] Baraterndr nfard fy. [Kyle looks. Pause.]
345,2,4,Social Worker,You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you.
346,2,4,Mr Mackey,But I don't think I really have a problem.
347,2,4,Social Worker,Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
348,2,4,Mr Mackey,I don't really have a family.
349,2,4,Social Worker,And you lost your job.
350,2,4,Mr Mackey,"No, I lost my job before that."
351,2,4,Social Worker,"Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult."
352,2,4,Social Worker,"The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad."
353,2,4,Mr Mackey,Drugs are baad.
354,2,4,Social Worker,Drugs are bad.
355,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
356,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris."
357,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one."
358,2,4,Where is the little rug rat,Dialog
359,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,Right over here.
360,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"Come 'ere, you."
361,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Oowwww!
362,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Oh deh faminrr.
363,2,4,Dr Schwartz,Ike? Ike?
364,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr.
365,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"There you are. Come on Ike, it's time."
366,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,You stay away from my little brother!
367,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"[Stammers.] Bu-bu-but, son, I just--"
368,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!"
369,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"[Now in the room.] Kyle, what are you talking about?"
370,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
371,2,4,Eric Cartman,"[A bit solemnly.] Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. [Stan draws a blank.]"
372,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and..."
373,2,4,Dr Schwartsz,...his brother had it.
374,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No! No, it isn't true!"
375,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"We're not going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger."
376,2,4,Stan and Cartman wonder,Dialog
377,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!"
378,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. [Kyle looks up.]"
379,2,4,Social Worker,"Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered."
380,2,4,Mr Mackey,"I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again."
381,2,4,Social Worker,Just one more thing.
382,2,4,Social Worker,Remember that you can stay sober.
383,2,4,Mr Mackey,"I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will. [They embrace one last time.] M'kay?"
384,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"It's okay, Ike. I'm here."
385,2,4,Dr Schwartz,And-a one and-a two and-a... bris. [Snip.]
386,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Ouch. Amuhbuhbuhbuh.
387,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Cookie Monster.
388,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Gets up.] Ike, you're okay. [Cartman and Stan get up.]"
389,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad."
390,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about."
391,2,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
392,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family. [Tugs on Ike and moves away.] Except for Cartman.
393,2,4,Stan Marsh,[Follows.] Naturally.
394,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!"
395,2,4,Mr Garrison,"And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol."
396,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life..."
397,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?"
398,2,4,Stan Marsh,"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine."
399,2,4,Eric Cartman,"No way, I set up mine first, hippie!"
400,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?"
401,2,4,Stan Marsh,"[Mimicking.] Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?"
402,2,4,Mr Mackey,M'kay.
403,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,M'kay?
404,2,4,Mr Mackey,M'kay.
405,2,4,Eric Cartman,Okay?
406,2,4,Mr Mackey,Okay.
407,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?"
