12,2,13,Fred the Announcer,"That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival."
13,2,13,Fred the Announcer,"Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!"

20,2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!"
21,2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow."
22,2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!"
23,2,13,Jimbo Kern,This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!
24,2,13,Jimbo Kern,Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!
25,2,13,Tom and Mary,This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
26,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it."
27,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive."
28,2,13,Mayor McDaniels,Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
29,2,13,Toss a Ball Operator,"Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes."
30,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls."
31,2,13,Stan Marsh,Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
32,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs."
33,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
34,2,13,Stan Marsh,Really?
35,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves."
36,2,13,Eric Cartman,Wwow!
37,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that kicks ass!"
38,2,13,Eric Cartman,"[Breathlessly.] Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?"
39,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Five dollars for three balls.
40,2,13,Eric Cartman,Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
41,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth."
42,2,13,Eric Cartman,That's easy!
43,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Okay, we've got a player!"
44,2,13,Eric Cartman,Ay! Check it out!
45,2,13,Eric Cartman,Damn it!
46,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper."
47,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!"
48,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You suck, Cartman!"
49,2,13,Eric Cartman,I'd like to see you do better!
50,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Give me that!
51,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
52,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,It's gotta go through her mouth.
53,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,But ih-
54,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars."
55,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Here, give me some money, Cartman!"
56,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Lend me money, fat boy!"
57,2,13,Eric Cartman,"I only have three dollars left, asshole!"
58,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
59,2,13,Jimbo Kern,"[Still onstage.] Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!"
60,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, give me some money!"
61,2,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!"
62,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
63,2,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!"
64,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,I will if you give me money!
65,2,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Okay, here!"
66,2,13,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
67,2,13,Jimbo Kern,"Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows."
68,2,13,Jimbo Kern,"With that said, let's rock and roll!"
69,2,13,Jimbo Kern,Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!
70,2,13,Jimbo Kern,They're loose!
71,2,13,Cows,Mooooo?!
72,2,13,Ned Gerblansky,Ow.
73,2,13,Jimbo Kern,[Running by.] Yeehaw!
74,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
75,2,13,Eric Cartman,"I only need one, dude. I only need one."
76,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts."
77,2,13,Stan Marsh,What's that?
78,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
79,2,13,Eric Cartman,How much is it?
80,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Just three tickets, boys."
81,2,13,Chamber of Farts Ride,Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
82,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Is it like a- haunted house or something?
83,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Sure. It's veery scary.
84,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five."
85,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
86,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over."
87,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You'd better be right, dude."
88,2,13,Eric Cartman,I'm right!
89,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Keep your hands inside at all times.
90,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
91,2,13,Chamber of Farts Ride,"So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!"
92,2,13,Eric Cartman,Eh! God-damnit!
93,2,13,Stan Marsh,What the hell was that?
94,2,13,Chamber of Farts Ride,Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!
95,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"All right, boys. Ride's over."
96,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
97,2,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
98,2,13,Eric Cartman,[As they step down.] I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
99,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"That was a waste of money, Cartman!"
100,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets."
101,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
102,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money."
103,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!"
104,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,This ride better be good!
105,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, this line is way too long!"
106,2,13,Eric Cartman,I think we're almost to the end.
107,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
108,2,13,Stan Marsh,Here we go.
109,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Finally!
110,2,13,Line Ride Operator,Did ya enjoy the ride?
111,2,13,Stan Marsh,What ride?
112,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
113,2,13,Line Ride Operator,"This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line."
114,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
115,2,13,Line Ride Operator,"That's five tickets, thank you very much."
116,2,13,Line Ride Operator,Come see us again soon.
117,2,13,Stan Marsh,My ass we will!
118,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!"
119,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again."
120,2,13,Photo Seller,Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?
121,2,13,Eric Cartman,How much?
122,2,13,Photo Seller,Just three dollars.
123,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet."
124,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You dumbass, Cartman!"
125,2,13,Eric Cartman,What? This is cool.
126,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's not cool!"
127,2,13,Eric Cartman,"It is, too!"
128,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Can I help you boys.
129,2,13,Stan Marsh,We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
130,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"O-kay, five dollars for three balls."
131,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"How much do we have left, Cartman?"
132,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"How much do we have left, Cartman?!"
133,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Aah, three dollars."
134,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!"
135,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math."
136,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
137,2,13,Eric Cartman,Ey! Seriously!
138,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
139,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry!"
140,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?"
141,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Thinks a moment.] Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
142,2,13,Kenny McCormick,[Pulls some out.] (What? These?)
143,2,13,Stan Marsh,Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
144,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Sure, as long as they're good."
145,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Give him your food stamps, Kenny!"
146,2,13,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh uh.)
147,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!"
148,2,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)"
149,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!"
150,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Okay. Here we go.
151,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! That was right on target.
152,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Sorry, kid. Try again."
153,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,That does it! Shenanigans!
154,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,SHENANIGANS!
155,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Uhwhat are you doing?
156,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
157,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Shenanigans?
158,2,13,Officer Barbrady,What's all the hoo-ha?
159,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator."
160,2,13,Officer Barbrady,Why?
161,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
162,2,13,Officer Barbrady,"If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just."
163,2,13,Officer Barbrady,"What do you have to say, carnival operator?"
164,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son."
165,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Here you go.
166,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"There, you see? We have a winner!"
167,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,It worked!
168,2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!"
169,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby."
170,2,13,Officer Barbrady,Barbrady!
171,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?"
172,2,13,Officer Barbrady,You said Buttbaby.
173,2,13,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
174,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick."
175,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
176,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those."
177,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
178,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
179,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-"
180,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"[Ignoring them, speaking to the crowd] Step on up, just five dollars to play!"
181,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Damnit, I have to have those dolls!"
182,2,13,Stan Marsh,This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
183,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[Something stops him.] Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000."
184,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!"
185,2,13,Eric Cartman,What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
186,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[Grabbing Cartman by the collar.] Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open!"
187,2,13,Eric Cartman,"O-kay, I'll get on the bull."
188,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!"
189,2,13,Stan Marsh,[To Cartman.] He really wants those dolls.
190,2,13,Eric Cartman,"I guess, damn!"
191,2,13,Tom and Mary,That ride wasn't very good.
192,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time."
193,2,13,Tom and Mary,"You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time."
194,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman."
195,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Hey, this is sweet."
196,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?"
197,2,13,Eric Cartman,I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
198,2,13,Stan Marsh,We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
199,2,13,Eric Cartman,Ye-gah!
200,2,13,Eric Cartman,Ow!
201,2,13,Eric Cartman,Son of a bitch!
202,2,13,Stan Marsh,How long was that?
203,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,That wasn't quite ten seconds.
204,2,13,Stan Marsh,Damn it!
205,2,13,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that."
206,2,13,Eric Cartman,"[Whispering.] You guys, eh seriously, my back!"
207,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!"
208,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Whispering.] Seriously. Help.
209,2,13,Eric Cartman,Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
210,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What'd you say, Cartman??"
211,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Whispering.] I hate you guys!
212,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
213,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Whispering.] Hate you guys.
214,2,13,Rancher,"Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got."
215,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull."
216,2,13,Rancher,"Well, have fun, boys."
217,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Cartman. You ready?"
218,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Hesitantly.] Nnoo.
219,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Open the gate!
220,2,13,Eric Cartman,"All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride."
221,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,[Whispers to Stan.] That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
222,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet!"
223,2,13,Stan Marsh,What are you going to do?
224,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball.
225,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea."
226,2,13,Eric Cartman,Eeyy!
227,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,That's better.
228,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Hold on, Cartman!"
229,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!"
230,2,13,Eric Cartman,Mother f-
231,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!"
232,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Cartman."
233,2,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)"
234,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!"
235,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Get up!
236,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Get UP!
237,2,13,Stan Marsh,"You okay, dude?"
238,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?"
239,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I think we broke him."
240,2,13,Dr Doctor,"Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma."
241,2,13,Stan Marsh,What's the matter with him.
242,2,13,Dr Doctor,"Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li."
243,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,..Oh.
244,2,13,Stan Marsh,But can he still ride a bull?
245,2,13,Dr Doctor,What?
246,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
247,2,13,Dr Doctor,"No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep."
248,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it!
249,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?"
