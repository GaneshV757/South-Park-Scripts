0,2,11,Police Commissioner,"Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again."
1,2,11,Det. Barnaby Jones,"[Now quite old.] All in a day's work, I guess. I just hope that next time, I won't have to run so much."
2,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, ""This is not a victimless crime""? Anybody?"
3,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Children, were you paying attention?!"
4,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention."
5,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?"
6,2,11,Stan Marsh,Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
7,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, and what do you consider normal?!"
8,2,11,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff."
9,2,11,The Class,Yeah!
10,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!"
11,2,11,The Class,Hooray!
12,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,To where?
13,2,11,Mr Garrison,To the planetarium.
14,2,11,The Class,AAWWWW!
15,2,11,Eric Cartman,Planetariums suck!
16,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?"
17,2,11,Stan Marsh,It's boring.
18,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, all the constellations look alike."
19,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege."
20,2,11,The Class,[Softly.] Aawwww.
21,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials."
22,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"Hey kids, do you love Cheesy Poofs?"
23,2,11,The Class,Yes.
24,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country."
25,2,11,Eric Cartman,I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
26,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"If you win, you could be picked to be in our next Cheesy Poofs commercial. So remember,

I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame."
27,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road."
28,2,11,Ms Crabtree,THAT AIN'T HOW YOU DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!!
29,2,11,Mr Garrison,"[Rubbing the back of his head.] Ow! Jesus, lady!"
30,2,11,Ms Crabtree,"THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!"
31,2,11,Kid,[Voice quivering.] Ow.
32,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves."
33,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,[Over a loudspeaker nearby.] Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer?
34,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, there it is!"
35,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
36,2,11,Eric Cartman,I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
37,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!"
38,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium."
39,2,11,Eric Cartman,But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
40,2,11,Mr Garrison,"No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on!"
41,2,11,Eric Cartman,[Whining.] But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
42,2,11,A Boy,"Wow, don't you...?"
43,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,What is that?
44,2,11,Dr Adams,"Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium."
45,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"I thought it was ""plane-*tarium*."""
46,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the ""t"" in ""plane'arium""."
47,2,11,Mr Garrison,That's a pretty weird bone disease.
48,2,11,Dr Adams,Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.
49,2,11,Dr Adams,"Yes, little boy?"
50,2,11,Eric Cartman,How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
51,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works."
52,2,11,Eric Cartman,As if we care.
53,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, who are you?"
54,2,11,Dr Adams,"Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us."
55,2,11,Missy,I love my work.
56,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?"
57,2,11,Missy,I love my work.
58,2,11,Dr Adams,"Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?"
59,2,11,Dr Adams,"Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable."
60,2,11,Stan Marsh,This is stupid.
61,2,11,Dr Adams,And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... eh-come out.
62,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,[Not amused.] Whoopie.
63,2,11,Dr Adams,"Here we see the constellation called, ""The Big Dipper"". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it...[Very softly.] a-hah [The drawing appears, connecting the stars.] ...we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull..."
64,2,11,Dr Adams,"...while these stars form the constellation, ""Roger Ebert""."
65,2,11,Dr Adams,And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades.
66,2,11,Dr Adams,"Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of..."
67,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, screw this."
68,2,11,Dr Adams,And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.
69,2,11,Dr Adams,"I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that."
70,2,11,Boy,"...you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame."
71,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner."
72,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!"
73,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"Oh, and what's your name, little boy?"
74,2,11,Eric Cartman,Eric Cartman.
75,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot."
76,2,11,Tommy,Aaah!
77,2,11,Eric Cartman,"[Clears his throat and affects a tenor]

I love Cheesy Poofs
you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs
we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!"
78,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,[Slapping his palm to his head] Wow!
79,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Thaat's right, suck on that."
80,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?"
81,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, man, I don't feel so good."
82,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium."
83,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Me too. It was sweet.
84,2,11,Mr Garrison,Really? What did you like best about it?
85,2,11,Stan Marsh,I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
86,2,11,Mr Garrison,[Tallying.] Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
87,2,11,Eric Cartman,[Happily popping by.] I did it! I did it!
88,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Did what?
89,2,11,Eric Cartman,I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
90,2,11,Mr Garrison,You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
91,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!"
92,2,11,Dr Adams,"[Now at the door.] Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor."
93,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,My head still feels funny.
94,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, mine too."
95,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want."
96,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Like you really need it, hippo-ass!"
97,2,11,Eric Cartman,"[With some pity.] It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is."
98,2,11,Boy,Waaaah!
99,2,11,Stan Marsh,AAAAAH!
100,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAH!
101,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!"
102,2,11,Boy,[Haltingly.] My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.
103,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!"
104,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!"
105,2,11,Van Gelder,[In a state of panic.] Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!
106,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, be careful, asshole!"
107,2,11,Van Gelder,Eegh! Don't take me back there!
108,2,11,Van Gelder,I can't... can't...
109,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!"
110,2,11,Van Gelder,Aaaagghh.
111,2,11,Mr Garrison,"[Quickly at his side.] We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!"
112,2,11,Van Gelder,[Very agitated.] Aagh! The planetarium! Haah!
113,2,11,Nurse Gollum,I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
114,2,11,Van Gelder,Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!
115,2,11,Mr Mackey,Okay uh van Gelder-
116,2,11,Van Gelder,Nnnaaaah!
117,2,11,Mr Mackey,"-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?"
118,2,11,Van Gelder,Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh-
119,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?"
120,2,11,Principal Victoria,"Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium."
121,2,11,Van Gelder,Haah! Planetarium!
122,2,11,Principal Victoria,I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
123,2,11,Van Gelder,Nnaaah!
124,2,11,Principal Victoria,"Oh, man, this is boring!"
125,2,11,Man,"Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting?"
126,2,11,Teen 1,"Dude, this is totally killer."
127,2,11,Teen 2,"I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man."
128,2,11,Dr Adams,You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.
129,2,11,Dr Adams,Incredible pain!
130,2,11,Dr Adams,Incredible icky paaiin!
131,2,11,Teen 1,"Dude, I'm totally tripping."
132,2,11,Teen 2,This is totally killer.
133,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?"
134,2,11,Stan Marsh,That's a haiku?
135,2,11,Mr Garrison,"No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school."
136,2,11,Stan Marsh,Oh.
137,2,11,Mr Garrison,Was he on the school bus this morning?
138,2,11,Stan Marsh,No.
139,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[counting off the syllables]

Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd."
140,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?"
141,2,11,Kenny McCormick,"(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)"
142,2,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah. What's a discharge?
143,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?"
144,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too."
145,2,11,Mr Garrison,But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
146,2,11,Stan Marsh,"[Stumped, then to Kyle.] Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?"
147,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
148,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street."
149,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams."
150,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Eric, where have you been?"
151,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?"
152,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Where have you been, Cartman?"
153,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!"
154,2,11,The Class,Whoa!
155,2,11,Eric Cartman,"This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it? [Now taunting.] Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?"
156,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?"
157,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Apparently, only I do."
158,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too."
159,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion."
160,2,11,Stan Marsh,Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
161,2,11,Eric Cartman,It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
162,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV."
163,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Very good, Kyle."
164,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it!"
165,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Um. How's he doing, nurse?"
166,2,11,Nurse Gollum,"He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now."
167,2,11,Van Gelder,Nno! No drugs.
168,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Drugs are good, mkay?"
169,2,11,Van Gelder,Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!
170,2,11,Nurse Gollum,"But why, van Gelder?"
171,2,11,Van Gelder,The machine. The machine is aaaah.
172,2,11,Mr Mackey,The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
173,2,11,Nurse Gollum,"He's been talking about ""the machine"" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes."
174,2,11,Van Gelder,Wha- why in America's Funniest Home Videos? Why?
175,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?"
176,2,11,Nurse Gollum,A what?
177,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope."
178,2,11,Nurse Gollum,"Well, what will you need?"
179,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time. [Oh, the tension!] Mkay?"
180,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more."
181,2,11,Mr Garrison,They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
182,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?"
183,2,11,The Class,Yes.
184,2,11,Teen 1,"This way, please."
185,2,11,Teen 2,Enjoy your visit.
186,2,11,Dr Adams,"Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star."
187,2,11,Mr Garrison,I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
188,2,11,Dr Adams,"Certainly, Mr. Garrison."
189,2,11,Dr Adams,You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-
190,2,11,Dr Adams,...and right over here we see the constellation Orion.
191,2,11,Dr Adams,"Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar..."
192,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what just happened?"
193,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean?
194,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens."
195,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Don't pick your nose, hon."
196,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!"
197,2,11,Liane Cartman,Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
198,2,11,Eric Cartman,I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
199,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,"Do you think I might win, Mommy?"
200,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,"I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while."
201,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!"
202,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,"[Gasps.] Did you hear that, Mommy?"
203,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs!
204,2,11,Eric Cartman,Sike!
205,2,11,Mr Garrison,[Noticing them.] What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
206,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-"
207,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Sshh!
208,2,11,Dr Adams,"Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming."
209,2,11,Clyde Donovan,[Insistently.] I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
210,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!"
211,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here."
212,2,11,Clyde Donovan,"Yes. Yes, please!"
213,2,11,Butters Stotch,Me too!
214,2,11,Annie Knitts,Me too! I wanna do it! I'd love to work here.
215,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,I'd like to tape the show!
216,2,11,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, me too! Me too!"
217,2,11,Fosse McDonald,"Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay!"
218,2,11,Dr Adams,Mr. Garrison?
219,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it."
220,2,11,Dr Adams,Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.
221,2,11,The Class,Hooray!
222,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this isn't right."
223,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
224,2,11,Stan Marsh,"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything."
225,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, yeah."
226,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there."
227,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
228,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see."
229,2,11,Kenny McCormick,(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.)
230,2,11,Stan Marsh,He hits this switch-
231,2,11,Kenny McCormick,(I don't see anything.)
232,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars."
233,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I guess so."
234,2,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Whoa, dude.)"
235,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,What does that do?
236,2,11,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
237,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! What's it doing?
238,2,11,Stan Marsh,"This says ""maximum."""
239,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!"
240,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,We're bastards!
241,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I told you something was up with this place!"
242,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!"
243,2,11,Boy,"(clap clap clap)

244,2,11,Center Judge,"[Applauds.] Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon."
245,2,11,Center Judge,"Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman."
246,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Hello, everybody. [To Cartman.] Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon."
247,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I know, I know!"
248,2,11,Eric Cartman,"She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right."
249,2,11,Eric Cartman,"She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right."
250,2,11,Center Judge,"[Long pause.] Well, Eric Cartman, that certainly was... insane."
251,2,11,Eric Cartman,Thank you.
252,2,11,Center Judge,We'll let you know.
253,2,11,Liane Cartman,Thank you.
254,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Don't pick your nose, hon."
255,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!"
256,2,11,Center Judge,"Jesus, where do we find these people?!"
257,2,11,Mr Mackey,Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
258,2,11,Nurse Gollum,This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
259,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded."
260,2,11,Mr Mackey,Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
261,2,11,Van Gelder,[Responding to the mind-meld.] Dr. Adams.
262,2,11,Mr Mackey,Yes.
263,2,11,Nurse Gollum,He owns the planetarium. What about him?
264,2,11,Van Gelder Mr Mackey simultaneously,He uses the machine. The star machine.
265,2,11,Mr Mackey,Mkay?
266,2,11,Van Gelder Mr Mackey simultaneously,He uses it to erase minds.
267,2,11,Nurse Gollum,But why?
268,2,11,Van Gelder Mr Mackey simultaneously,"Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive."
269,2,11,Nurse Gollum,My God! This is amazing!
270,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?"
271,2,11,Center Judge,"Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman."
272,2,11,Eric Cartman,[Triumphantly.] Yes! I'm the best!
273,2,11,Center Judge,You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.
274,2,11,Blonde Judge,That's odd.
275,2,11,Eric Cartman,[Joyfully.] Sweeet!
276,2,11,Tom,It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.
277,2,11,Asian Reporter,"Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams."
278,2,11,Dr Adams,"Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium."
279,2,11,Asian Reporter,"So, bring the whole family to the plane-*tarium* for a night of excitement and wonder."
280,2,11,Stan Marsh,"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis."
281,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys."
282,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"But it's true, dude!"
283,2,11,Officer Barbrady,Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
284,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, pretty sure."
285,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong."
286,2,11,Stan Marsh,What other crime in South Park?
287,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, yeah. Let's go."
288,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
289,2,11,Eric Cartman,I'm over here.
290,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy."
291,2,11,Eric Cartman,Aay!
292,2,11,Eric Cartman,Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
293,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,"Okay, roll camera, aaand action."
294,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you-"
295,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Oh wait, wait."
296,2,11,Liane Cartman,"You've got a little eye booger, hon."
297,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!"
298,2,11,Liane Cartman,Got it.
299,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,Aaand action.
300,2,11,Eric Cartman,I love Cheesy Poofs-
301,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
302,2,11,Stagehand,Sure thing.
303,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man, c'mon!"
304,2,11,Stagehand,Got it.
305,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,"Okay. Here we go, aaand action."
306,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-"
307,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,Cut!
308,2,11,Eric Cartman,What?!
309,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
310,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God damnit!"
311,2,11,Dr Adams,"Oh. Hello, officer of the law."
312,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator."
313,2,11,Dr Adams,What brings you out here?
314,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town."
315,2,11,Dr Adams,"Oh, really?"
316,2,11,Officer Barbrady,Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.
317,2,11,Dr Adams,"Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time."
318,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, I'll be quick, then."
319,2,11,Dr Adams,"Of course, officer. Come on in."
320,2,11,Chef,"[In a low monotone.] Hello, children."
321,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no! They got Chef, too!"
322,2,11,Chef,Welcome to the planetarium.
323,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef."
324,2,11,Chef,"[Slowly, mechanically.] I love my work."
325,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too."
326,2,11,Dr Adams,"Would you like to see the stars, officer?"
327,2,11,Stan Marsh,No!
328,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,No!
329,2,11,Officer Barbrady,That would be super-duper!
330,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!"
331,2,11,Elderly Woman,[On the phone.] Hello?
332,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric."
333,2,11,Grandma Cartman,"Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you."
334,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch."
335,2,11,Grandma Cartman,"Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-"
336,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Okay, bye."
337,2,11,The Marshes Answering Machine,Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.

339,2,11,The Broflovskis Answering Machine,"Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message."
340,2,11,Eric Cartman,Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
341,2,11,Dr Adams,And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
342,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, neato!"
343,2,11,Dr Adams,"[Turning intensity up to 8.5] And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley."
344,2,11,Officer Barbrady,Who?
345,2,11,Dr Adams,To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
346,2,11,Officer Barbrady,Pain.
347,2,11,Dr Adams,"You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me."
348,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,He's not highly intelligent.
349,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Why are you doing this, dude?"
350,2,11,Dr Adams,"Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!"
351,2,11,Voice over,Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
352,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, dude, here it comes!"
353,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Commercial Hopefuls,"Packed full of ingredients, Cheesy Poofs can really give you that quick pick-me-up. So remember, [A dancing Cheesy Poofs box appears.] 
I love Cheesy Poofs,

[The box opens and Cheesy Poof pour out.]
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs,

[The Cheesy Poofs rain down on a pile of Cheesy Poof in which children swim.]"
354,2,11,Cheesy Poof Cartman,Lame.
355,2,11,Voice over,And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
356,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!"
357,2,11,Mr Mackey,Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
358,2,11,Stan Marsh,Mr. Mackey!
359,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control."
360,2,11,Officer Barbrad,[Doing a twisted Elvis Presley.] Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?
361,2,11,Nurse Gollum,What's wrong with him?
362,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babe
uhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah."
363,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston."
364,2,11,Dr Adams,"No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis. [To Barbrady.] Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium."
365,2,11,Officer Barbrady,[Snapping into a sharp Elvis.] Holdjit
366,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?"
367,2,11,Mr Mackey,Uh oh.
368,2,11,Officer Barbrady,[Voice skipping up the scales.] Odle-oh who whoo?
369,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, let's begin, shall we?"
370,2,11,Dr Adams,"And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known!"
371,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!"
372,2,11,Eric Cartman,Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
373,2,11,Eric Cartman,You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
374,2,11,Eric Cartman,Planetariums suck ass!
375,2,11,Dr Adams,Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
376,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,[Coming out of the trance.] Cartman! You saved us!
377,2,11,Eric Cartman,What the hell are you talking about?
378,2,11,Stan Marsh,Get over here and untie us!
379,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?"
380,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"[Rushing in.] Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business."
381,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?"
382,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"[Snapping out of it.] Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor."
383,2,11,Stan Marsh,Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
384,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,He got a full dose of the stars.
385,2,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
386,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing."
387,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero."
388,2,11,Liane Cartman,"[Looking in.] Don't pick your nose, hon."
389,2,11,Eric Cartman,"God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!"
