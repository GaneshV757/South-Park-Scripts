13,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman!"
14,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"Okay, that does it! Y'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies!"
15,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would."
16,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, she would, dude. She would."

28,2,7,All,Aaaah!
29,2,7,Guide,...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area.

33,2,7,All,Aaaah-
34,2,7,Eric Cartman,All done!
35,2,7,Ms Crabtree,SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!
36,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"I SAID 'QUIET,' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY!"
37,2,7,Stan Marsh,Where are we?
38,2,7,Ms Crabtree,I have no idea.
39,2,7,Stan Marsh,I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
40,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what are we supposed to do?"
41,2,7,Ms Crabtree,Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual.
42,2,7,Eric Cartman,Ms. Crabtree?
43,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!"
44,2,7,Trainer,"[The video starts.] Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'"
45,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!"
46,2,7,Trainer,"That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'"
47,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!"
48,2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?"
49,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!"
50,2,7,Ms Crabtree,WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
51,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'"
52,2,7,Ms Crabtree,Oh.
53,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on."
54,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"Had to happen to me, didn't it?"
55,2,7,Truck Driver,"Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too-"
56,2,7,Truck Driver,"Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa."
57,2,7,Truck Driver,"Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?"
58,2,7,Ms Crabtree,SHUT UP AND HELP ME INTO THIS THIING!
59,2,7,Truck Driver,Whoa. Hehum huh.

68,2,7,Ms Crabtree,HOW FAR TO THE NEAREST TOOWWN?!
69,2,7,Truck Driver,Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
70,2,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever."
71,2,7,Kids,"[Gasp, then individually.] What? Huh?"
72,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days."
73,2,7,Stan Marsh,Dude!
74,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,What?
75,2,7,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes! [Panics.] You guys suck!
76,2,7,Stan Marsh,Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
