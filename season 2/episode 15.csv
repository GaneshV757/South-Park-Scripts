0,2,15,Announcer,The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.
1,2,15,Stan Marsh,I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
2,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
3,2,15,Eric Cartman,Hey guys. How's it going?
4,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?"
5,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?"
6,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
7,2,15,Eric Cartman,"You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up."
8,2,15,Stan Marsh,What?
9,2,15,Eric Cartman,"I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed"
10,2,15,Eric Cartman,I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
11,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!"
12,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve."
13,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[Excited.] Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?"
14,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is creepy."
15,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo.
16,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Hello, Stanley. Remember me?"
17,2,15,Stanley,"[Flatly.] Hi, Aunt Flo."
18,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice."
19,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents."
20,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!"
21,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Okay, Shelly. This one's for you."
22,2,15,Aunt Flo,It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.
23,2,15,Stan Marsh,Wow!
24,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"What do you say, Shelly?"
25,2,15,Shelly,"Thank you, Aunt Flo."
26,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, Stanley. Your turn."
27,2,15,Aunt Flo,Your very own fish.
28,2,15,Shelly,"What do you say, Stanley?"
29,2,15,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
30,2,15,Aunt Flo,[Softly.] I think he likes you. [Normal.] Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.
31,2,15,Shelly,Okay.
32,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"How do you like your fish, Stanley?"
33,2,15,Stan Marsh,I don't like it. It's spooky.
34,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room."
35,2,15,Stan Marsh,Do I have to?
36,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, you do!"
37,2,15,Stan Marsh,Damn it!
38,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Language!
39,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Where have you been, dude?"
40,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor."
41,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Aunt Flo?
42,2,15,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
43,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
44,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice."
45,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Here he comes.
46,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?"
47,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[clean-shaven] Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!"
48,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You said you could get us money, Cartman!"
49,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!"
50,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, at least he's back to normal."
51,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!"
52,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
53,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!"
54,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Why do you keep saying ""hella"", fatass?!"
55,2,15,Eric Cartman,"'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why."
56,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,That's not cool!
57,2,15,Eric Cartman,You guys are just hella jealous.
58,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning."
59,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Can you leave the light on, Dad?"
60,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity."
61,2,15,Stan Marsh,I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
62,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. [turns the light off and closes the door]."
63,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Where did it go? [he lifts the covers and looks under the bed, then sits back. The fish swims back into view.] Huhhh. [he gets out, picks up his shirt, and throws it over the tank. He goes back to bed and looks at the tank again.]"
64,2,15,Kenny McCormick,(Give me that-!) [pulls the blanket off Kevin]
65,2,15,Mrs McCormick,Kenny [paf]
66,2,15,Kenny McCormick,"(Ow, mom!)"
67,2,15,Mrs McCormick,You share that blanket with your brother! [knock knock knock]
68,2,15,Stuart McCormick,Who the hell could that be? [the front door opens and the family looks to see who it is].
69,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[with mustache and beard, and dressed in raingear] Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. [a box of SUPPLIES is next to him. The parents look at each other] There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. [walks off]."
70,2,15,Stuart McCormick,"[suspicious] Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?"
71,2,15,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh.)
72,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey. Where did the shirt go? [hops off and approaches the fish] I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! [the fish blinks, then looks down and to the right. Stan's eyes follow, and he sees the shirt.] AAAaAaAaAa [runs back to his bed and pulls the covers up, then drops them a bit. He looks at the fish] I'm not gonna look. [shuts his eyes, then opens them again. The fish tank, and the dresser it's on, are closer to the bed] It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. [shuts his eyes again, then opens them. The tank and dresser are at the foot of his bed] GAAAH! [shuts his eyes tight, and opens them one more time. The fish tank is now on the bed, between his feet] AAAAAAAH!! [he jumps off, runs to his door, and rushes into the hallway] MOM! Mom! [comes back to the room with her in tow]"
73,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, settle down!"
74,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!"
75,2,15,Aunt Flo,[at the door] Is there a problem? [walks to Sharon]
76,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo."
77,2,15,Aunt Flo,Do you not like your goldfish?
78,2,15,Stan Marsh,No!
79,2,15,Aunt Flo,I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt. [buries her face in her hand and begins to sob.]
80,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. [he merely looks up at them]"
81,2,15,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAAAH! [runs back to bed]
82,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[enters his room and turns on the lights] Stanley, what are you doing?!"
83,2,15,Stan Marsh,[pointing] The fish! [nothing is left of the writing on the tank wall] But-
84,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up. [Shelly stands in front of Sharon, then approaches Stan and slaps him, then leaves the room] Go to sleep, Stanley! [turns off the light and closes the door behind her.]"
85,2,15,Stan Marsh,[gasps. A man lies dead between the tank and the bed] WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
86,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"All right, Stanley. I have had enough o- [freezes when she sees the body, then, quivering] Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? [rushes to comfort him]"
87,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-"
88,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[covers his mouth with her arm, then quietly] Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel. [kisses him and gets up] Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body. [starts to drag it away] Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. [she drags the body out of the room and out into the storm. Stan just looks at her]"
89,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[turns to the fish] You're not gonna get away with this! [the fish writes again, blows, and the message is: ""Yes I Will.""]"
90,2,15,Aunt Flo,[her silhouette appears] Sharon!
91,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!"
92,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve."
93,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[sees Sharon pass by] Mom, what are you doing?"
94,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley."
95,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!"
96,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[enters the room] Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything."
97,2,15,Stan Marsh,But MOM!
98,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[Cradles Stan] Sshh.

Hush little baby, don't say a word.
Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' bird.
If that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard"
99,2,15,Stan Marsh,MMOOMM!
100,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[frantic] What is it, honey? [gasp!] My baby's killed again!"
101,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[points at the body, then holds up his hands] No, mom!"
102,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[holds him tight] What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do?? [the fish looks on. Sharon drags the body out] I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy."
103,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?"
104,2,15,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh!)
105,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Well, where is it? [Kenny brings out a squash and sets it on the table] What the hell is that?!"
106,2,15,Kenny McCormick,(It's the only thing I could afford.)
107,2,15,Eric Cartman,"It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!"
108,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman! [to Kenny] How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? [as Kyle says this Stan enters the room] Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good."
109,2,15,Stan Marsh,[squeezes into Kyle's chair so both fit. Cartman walks to Kenny's chair] I haven't been sleeping so well.
110,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[cuts the top off the squash and taps at the bottom to clear it out. Sigh] God, I hate you, Kenny. [works on the squash some more] I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! [goes into the kitchen for another one]"
111,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"God, will you shut up?!"
112,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?"
113,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
114,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Do you think animals can be murderers, too?"
115,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. [the bearded Cartman comes in with a huge knife] Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again."
116,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[gives Kenny a hand] No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?


You guys are my best friends
Through thick and thin, we've always been together
We're four of a kind, havin' fun all day
Pallin' around and laughin' away
Just best friends, best friends are we.

 I love you guys. [throughout the song, Kyle and Stan look on with awe]"
117,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You seem tired, Stan."
118,2,15,Stan Marsh,I haven't been sleeping well.
119,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
120,2,15,Stan Marsh,My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
121,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh, that sucks, dude."
122,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here."
123,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman?
124,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!"
125,2,15,Stan Marsh,What are you doing?!
126,2,15,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys."
127,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't be standing there, Cartman."
128,2,15,Eric Cartman,Why the hell not?!
129,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Because you're standing over there!
130,2,15,Eric Cartman,[seeing his parallel for the first time] Aaah! Son of a bitch!
131,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"[Cartman walks to him] Wow, you don't see this every day."
132,2,15,Eric Cartman,I can't believe what I'm seeing.
133,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
134,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this is hella weird."
135,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[answering] Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you?"
136,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Well, there's been a report of a few missing people."
137,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Is that so?
138,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. [show her some pictures of the missing men]"
139,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady."
140,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?"
141,2,15,Sharon Marsh,[somewhat alarmed] Why would you wanna do that?
142,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I? [Sharon moves aside and Barbrady enters. They head for the back yard, where five fresh graves await around the clubhouse, and Sparky is pulling a leg out of one of them. Sparky pulls it free and walks away with it] Well, this all looks in- [clunk] oh? Tennis anyone? [falls to the floor unconscious. Sharon had hit him with a pan]"
143,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
144,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"[missing his pants and shoes, his wrists are tied to posts] Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions."
145,2,15,Chef,"[excited] Hello there, children! [he is dressed as an African chieftain, complete with reebock skull]"
146,2,15,The Boys,"Hey, Chef."
147,2,15,Chef,"All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries."
148,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Chef?"
149,2,15,Chef,Or haaauuunted hash browns.
150,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Chef.
151,2,15,Chef,"And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!"
152,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Chef.
153,2,15,Chef,And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
154,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Chef!
155,2,15,Chef,What?!
156,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,We have problems!
157,2,15,Chef,"Well, what's the first problem?"
158,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people."
159,2,15,Chef,"Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem? [Kyle points to Cartman, but now there are two of him. They blink together.] Oh, nohoho. [rubs his eyes] Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!"
160,2,15,Eric Cartman,"...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!"
161,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too."
162,2,15,Chef,Exactly what do you remember?
163,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car."
164,2,15,Chef,Of course! That's it!
165,2,15,Stan Marsh,What?
166,2,15,Chef,"Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!"
167,2,15,Eric Cartman,He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
168,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Will you stop saying that word?!
169,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!"
170,2,15,Chef,"Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!"
171,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef."
172,2,15,Chef,How do you mean?
173,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman."
174,2,15,Aunt Flo,"[shaking] Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo."
175,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
176,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[taps Kyle, then softly] Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease."
177,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Ey, sweet! [hops on her lap] Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her."
178,2,15,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
179,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this is hella cool."
180,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?"
181,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Nn-oh. [Cartman hops off and rejoins the boys] I got it from the pet store, Stanley."
182,2,15,Stan Marsh,Do you remember what pet store?
183,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Let's see. I believe it was called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store,"" just outside of town."
184,2,15,Stan Marsh,Where?
185,2,15,Aunt Flo,I know I have the address written down somewhere. [Stan turns and takes Kyle aside] Let me look.
186,2,15,Stan Marsh,"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store."
187,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Who's ""we""? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!"
188,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"I'll help you, Stan."
189,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!"
190,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
191,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Just help me take it back. Come on! [walks to Aunt Flo, who's now dead on the floor] Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!"
192,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[rushing in] Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! [holds her hands to her face]"
193,2,15,Stan Marsh,It was the fish! [points to it]
194,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[dragging Aunt Flo, mutters] Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. [the fish swims around]"
195,2,15,Stan Marsh,Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
196,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. [the fish jumps out and somehow pulls Kenny into the tank head first.]"
197,2,15,Stan Marsh,Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. [Kenny starts to gargle as the fish gives him the blender treatment. The water turns blood red as Kenny spins in the tank]
198,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book."
199,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,Can do!
200,2,15,Eric Cartman,Screw you! [the fish spits Kenny's corpse out of the tank and jumps back in. Kenny's left eye is gone and the water is clear]
201,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[returning] It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! [sees Kenny's corpse and reacts frantically. Rats rush in to munch on it] I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! [drags Kenny away. The fish looks on]"
202,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Come on, we're running out of time. [both walk by Randy trying to open a door]"
203,2,15,Randy Marsh,"[turns around] Hey, why is the basement door locked? [turns back and keeps trying]"
204,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"-crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care"
205,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"I don't see any pet stores called ""Indian Burial Ground."""
206,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!"
207,2,15,Announcer,"And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special."
208,2,15,Terrance,[both are dressed as ghosts] (Fart)
209,2,15,Phillip,"[long pause] That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. [both pull out little daggers and stab each other as they laugh. Small spurts of blood ensue.]"
210,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! [slaps his thigh]"
211,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,[looks up] What's so funny about that?
212,2,15,Mr. Kitty,Meow.
213,2,15,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!"
214,2,15,Mr Kitty,Meow.
215,2,15,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!"
216,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"[picks up Kitty] Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. [Kitty is purring loudly, happily now. Cartman is not amused.]"
217,2,15,Eric Cartman,"NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!! [Evil Cartman is startled as Kitty jumps away.] Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude."
218,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
219,2,15,Mrs McCormick,"[approaches him] You saw him, didn't you? [Sharon mouths and waves ""no"" to Stan] You saw my boy. [sits down on the sofa between the boys]"
220,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, my goldfish-."
221,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over."
222,2,15,Mrs McCormick,"[cradling Stan, distraught] My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was."
223,2,15,Stan Marsh,I know.
224,2,15,Mrs McCormick,You've gotta tell me what happened to him! [holds Stan up and throttles him] You have to know something!
225,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[intervening] Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!"
226,2,15,Mrs McCormick,"That's right, I'm a little drunk. [Sharon escorts her to the door] You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy. [Evil Cartman enters as the women reach the door] My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh."
227,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"[at the sofa] You guys, I found the pet store!"
228,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go! [takes the fish with him and stops before Sharon] Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!"
229,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"I believe you, sweetheart. [Stan goes outside, and she addresses Kyle and Evil Cartman] Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!"
230,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,Can I help you boys?
231,2,15,Stan Marsh,I wanna return a fish.
232,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,[pounds the counter with both fists] Damn it!
233,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,What?
234,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it? [holds his palms out] Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?"
235,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude."
236,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Damn it! [pounds with the right fist] Just like all the other returns! [the camera pulls back to show them. They all groan and have red, evil eyes. One bird blinks, and its eyes glow]"
237,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"""
238,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it."
239,2,15,Stan Marsh,So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
240,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down."
241,2,15,Stan Marsh,Why?
242,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
243,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe."
244,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Well, that certainly would explain a lot."
245,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Like what?
246,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Well, like this. [opens a door marked, ""Employees Only."" A bright, flashing portal appears] I've been wondering what the hell this was."
247,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you. [Randy turns to see Officer Barbrady, then rushes up the stairs] Okay, bye, then."
248,2,15,Randy Marsh,Sharon?
249,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, hon?"
250,2,15,Randy Marsh,There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
251,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[rolling the dough] Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. [begins cutting out cookies in star shapes.]"
252,2,15,Randy Marsh,"[ponders] Why'd you take his pants off? [long pause. Sharon makes more cookies] Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?"
253,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[sobs. Randy comes over] Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore."
254,2,15,Randy Marsh,What is it?
255,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again."
256,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?"
257,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish."
258,2,15,Cler,I can't give you your money back.
259,2,15,Stan Marsh,"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!"
260,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,No! I won't take it back!
261,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, ""Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe."" Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly [pounds his right hand with his left fist], you're gonna take this fish back."
262,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"All right, you win."
263,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! [the clerk takes the fish from Stan]"
264,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"[turns to face the clerk again] And sir, can I make a suggestion? [the clerk looks at him] Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace."
265,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You kick ass, evil Cartman!"
266,2,15,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
267,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! [the boys exit the store, and the skies are clear]"
268,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer. [the clerk puts the fish up on a shelf and the employee door opens, the doorway glowing brightly]"
269,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,[recoils] What the-? [two figures appear: Evil Stan and Evil Kyle]
270,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,He was here! Cartman was just here!
271,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,Who are you?
272,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
273,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,I don't know who you mean?
274,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,[pulls out a big bat] Maybe this will jog your memory! [starts releasing the evil returns by bashing in the cages]
275,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
276,2,15,Stan Marsh,I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
277,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest."
278,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot."
279,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
280,2,15,Stan Marsh,"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman."
281,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella."""
282,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. [the boys turn to see a man attacked by two dogs, a cat, two ducks, and a vulture]"
283,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?"
284,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,Let's use Kenny's squash.
285,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care."
286,2,15,Terrance,"[as a ghost, walks up to Phillip] Boo!"
287,2,15,Phillip,[jumps up] Aaaaagh!
288,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. [click. The front door flies open and Evil Stan and Evil Kyle burst in]"
289,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"Aha! There you are, Cartman!"
290,2,15,Eric Cartman,"P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?"
291,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!"
292,2,15,Eric Cartman,Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
293,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"[he and Evil Kyle look at each other, then] Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?"
294,2,15,Eric Cartman,What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum. [checks them off] I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
295,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"[he and Evil Stan go over to grab him] Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!"
296,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Don't touch me! [punches Evil Stan, who releases him]"
297,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
298,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!"
299,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!"
300,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,Yes!
301,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. [leads them out the door]"
302,2,15,Mayor McDaniels,"And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! ""The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"""
303,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[the crowd cheers] We won, dude!"
304,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,Hooray!
305,2,15,Mayor McDaniels,You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
306,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Oh, no! [spots Cartman, Evil Stan and Evil Kyle] Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!"
307,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! [the two groups face each other]"
308,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[to Evil Kyle] Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!"
309,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!"
310,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"[to Evil Cartman] Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?!"
311,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,[pleading] Please!
312,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Leave him alone, butthole!"
313,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"Shut your trap, kid!"
314,2,15,Stan Marsh,Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
315,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!"
316,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification! [sets the gun]"
317,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun. [Stan and Kyle look down. The evil pets return to South Park and start attacking the townsfolk. They scream as they are being attacked.]"
318,2,15,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, what now?!"
319,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"It's the evil pets [the attack continues, and a vulture knocks the gingerification gun out of Evil Stan's hands.]"
320,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,The gingerification gun!
321,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[picks it up] Get to the stage! [Stan, Kyle, and Evil Cartman rush up. Stan's spooky fish attacks a man and kills him]"
322,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[seeing what just happened] Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!"
323,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"[all six boys are on stage] Give me that gun, kid!"
324,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Up yours, evil twin! [zaps him back to the evil, parallel universe.]"
325,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,[shrinks as Evil Kyle watches] Noooooo! [vanishes]
326,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"[zapped, he shrinks too] Noooooo! [vanishes]"
327,2,15,Eric Cartman,"All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!"
328,2,15,Stan Marsh,Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. [takes aim]
329,2,15,Eric Cartman,What?!
330,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! [Cartman takes on Evil Cartman, and both wrestle. Cartman rips off Evil Cartman's mustache and beard, and kicks him. Both of them then stand up, indistinguishable. Stan pulls the gingerification gun back]"
331,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Which one is the good Cartman?
332,2,15,Both Cartmans,I am!
333,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!"
334,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!"
335,2,15,Both Cartmans,[pointing to the other one] He is!
336,2,15,Cartman on Left,Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
337,2,15,Cartman on Right,What?!
338,2,15,Cartman on Left,"It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world."
339,2,15,Cartman on Right,[Stan zaps him] Noooo! Screw you guys! [disappears]
340,2,15,Cartman on Left,How did you guys know?
341,2,15,Stan Marsh,Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
342,2,15,Eric Cartman,Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
343,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no, dude!"
344,2,15,Stan Marsh,"You tricked us, Cartman!"
345,2,15,Eric Cartman,"That's right, I did!

You guys are hella stupid
You guys are hella lame
You guys are hella dumb
Hella hella hella!"
346,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it!
347,2,15,Randy Marsh,"I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore."
348,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor."
349,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Uuuh, do you want your pants back?"
350,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"No. Just leave me with my dignity. [turns around and walks into the crowd] Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here."
