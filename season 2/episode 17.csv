0,2,17,Mr Garrison,"[entering] Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad. [the class is now seated] The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again. [Stan raises his hand] Yes, Stanley?"
1,2,17,Stan Marsh,That's okay with us.
2,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
3,2,17,Clyde,"Yeah, we don't care."
4,2,17,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that's fine."
5,2,17,Mr Garrison,"No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board."
6,2,17,Class,Aawwww! [heads drop]
7,2,17,Mr Garrison,"[writes on the board] ""Current Events in South Park"". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on."
8,2,17,Class,Aawwww! [heads drop. Cartman is certainly vocal about it.]
9,2,17,Mr Garrison,"Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token, you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek."
10,2,17,Tweek Tweak,[disheveled and really tweaked] AAAghah heheh.
11,2,17,Stan Marsh,"[laments] Oh, not Tweek."
12,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
13,2,17,Mr Garrison,There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
14,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!"
15,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we can't work with this kid."
16,2,17,Tweek Tweak,Yuh-ugh!
17,2,17,Mr Garrison,"That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought, ""Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?"" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? [silence]"
18,2,17,Stan Marsh,No.
19,2,17,Mr Garrison,"Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!"
20,2,17,Tweek Tweak,Wagh!
21,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Hello there, customer."
22,2,17,Customer,Hello. How are you today?
23,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee? [motions to the menu]"
24,2,17,Customer,I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...
25,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling."
26,2,17,John Postum,That's right. How come you don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.
27,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale."
28,2,17,John Postum,"My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer. [lifts the briefcase and opens it. It's empty, but he elaborates] This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?"
29,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me."
30,2,17,John Postum,"Well, all right. [closes the briefcase and lifts up two money bag] How about $500,000?"
31,2,17,Richard Tweak,"The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. [moves to his left, towards a backdrop containing lovely rolling hills and a rainbow. A soothing acoustic tune comes up] Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more. [a cart of beans rolls up to him] And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America."
32,2,17,John Postum,"Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you."
33,2,17,Richard Tweak,[protesting] But that could put me out of business.
34,2,17,John Postum,"Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!"
35,2,17,Officer Barbrady,"[sees Postum leaving] Hello, Mr. Tweek."
36,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Hi, Officer Barbrady."
37,2,17,Officer Barbrady,Who was that?
38,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you."
39,2,17,Officer Barbrady,The usual.
40,2,17,Richard Tweak,Bye-bye.
41,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--"
42,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"[twitching and closing his right eye] AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn."
43,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about."
44,2,17,Eric Cartman,"How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond."
45,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[angry] No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?"
46,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!"
47,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Great. A lot of help you are, kid."
48,2,17,Tweek Tweak,The gnomes!
49,2,17,Stan Marsh,What?
50,2,17,Tweek Tweak,[gritting his teeth] We can do our report on the gnomes.
51,2,17,Stan Marsh,What gnomes?
52,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants."
53,2,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, so that's where all my underpants go."
54,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
55,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes."
56,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever."
57,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up."
58,2,17,Tweek Tweak,No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
59,2,17,Richard Tweak,"They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money."
60,2,17,Mrs Tweak,Some things are more important than money. [turns around] The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.
61,2,17,Richard Tweak,"I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip."
62,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Oh, hello, son. How was your day?"
63,2,17,Tweek Tweak,UUuuUunh!
64,2,17,Mrs Tweek,That's good. Who are your little friends?
65,2,17,Tweek Tweak,What do you mean?!
66,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,We're his oral report buddies.
67,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it."
68,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later."
69,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
70,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh."
71,2,17,Richard Tweak,"[waxing prosaic] Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm."
72,2,17,Stan Marsh,'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
73,2,17,Richard Tweak,Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses?
74,2,17,Mrs Tweak,Richard!
75,2,17,Richard Tweak,"No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery."
76,2,17,Tweek Tweak,Mwaaah! Slavery?
77,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Yes, slavery."
78,2,17,Stan Marsh,"[to Tweek] Wow, that sucks, dude."
79,2,17,Richard Tweak,They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
80,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
81,2,17,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
82,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes."
83,2,17,Tweek Tweak,Uunnnnhh!
84,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, you guys! We better get to work!"
85,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject."
86,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds."
87,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea."
88,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Man, this stuff is strong."
89,2,17,Stan Marsh,Kind of bitter.
90,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"[in a corner of the room, scared] What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?"
91,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,[going to him] Don't worry about it.
92,2,17,Tweek Tweak,But we'll starve and die like dogs.
93,2,17,Eric Cartman,"Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?"
94,2,17,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck you!)
95,2,17,Eric Cartman,"Heheh, you suck, Kenny."
96,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up."
97,2,17,Stan Marsh,Aooooo!
98,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,Woohoo!
99,2,17,Kenny McCormick,(Let me try! Let me try!)
100,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeess, this stuff rocks!"
101,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!"
102,2,17,Stan Marsh,[running] Whoopee!
103,2,17,Eric Cartman,"[running around the rim of a throw rug like an Olympian] You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that."
104,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?"
105,2,17,Tweek Tweak,I just have grounds.
106,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,Killer!! [goes for it and eats it raw]
107,2,17,Eric Cartman,"[rushing up] Ey, let me have some grounds. [take some, swallows, and throws up]"
108,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!"
109,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Hogh, my stomach hurts."
110,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why."
111,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[peeved] Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek."
112,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!"
113,2,17,Stan Marsh,"[cross] Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!"
114,2,17,Richard Tweak,"[checking] How's the report going, boys?"
115,2,17,Stan Marsh,Bad!
116,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, do you need some more coffee?"
117,2,17,Boys,Eugh.
118,2,17,Eric Cartman,No...more...coffee. Blech. [the vomit falls back on him and on the ground]
119,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you."
120,2,17,All,[suddenly bright] You did?!
121,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it."
122,2,17,Stan Marsh,"[goes with Kyle to get it] No, we'll use it."
123,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Alright. [Kyle takes it] And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?"
124,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Sure. [""work all night""]"
125,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Now, when you give the report, [Tweek gasps and points] just make sure that you read this part first, okay? [the gnomes open the door and enter:""Search for underpants, heyWe won't stop until we have underpantsYum tum yummy tum day""]"
126,2,17,Tweek Tweak,There they are!
