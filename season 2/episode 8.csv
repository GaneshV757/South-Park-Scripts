0,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?"
1,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!"
2,2,8,Mr Garrison,The prank is over!
3,2,8,Mr Garrison,"You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch."
4,2,8,Mr Garrison,God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!
5,2,8,Kids,Yea--
6,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!"
7,2,8,Kids,Awww..!
8,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!"
9,2,8,Mr Garrison,Okay. I'm going to turn around now.
10,2,8,Mr Garrison,Shit!
11,2,8,Pip,Where did everybody go?
12,2,8,Kids,Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!
13,2,8,Mother,"Oh golly, Kevin, honey."
14,2,8,Father,"Good to see you again, son."
15,2,8,Man,Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready.
16,2,8,Pip,"Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!"
17,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Pip."
18,2,8,Pip,"Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?"
19,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean?
20,2,8,Pip,"Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead."
21,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!"
22,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks."
23,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
24,2,8,Stan Marsh,"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt."
25,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
26,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!"
27,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, Cartman!"
28,2,8,Eric Cartman,"[Mumbles.] Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na."
29,2,8,Stu,"Hi, fellas."
30,2,8,Boys,"Hi, Stu."
31,2,8,Stu,What can I do for you?
32,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,We wanna buy M-80s.
33,2,8,Stan Marsh,The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
34,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that's it!"
35,2,8,Eric Cartman,Screw you guys! I'm going home.
36,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,What a baby.
37,2,8,Stan Marsh,"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please."
38,2,8,Stu,"I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?"
39,2,8,Stan Marsh,Heard what?
40,2,8,Stu,All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
41,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,What do ya mean?
42,2,8,Stu,It was in the paper this morning.
43,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?"
44,2,8,Stu,Right.
45,2,8,Stan Marsh,How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
46,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
47,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!"
48,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Oo bastards!
49,2,8,Stan Marsh,"A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass."
50,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?"
51,2,8,Stu,I can still sell snakes.
52,2,8,Stan Kyle Kenny,Awww..!
53,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake. [Listens.] I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call. [Switch.] Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems! [Switch.] Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smart-ass, I was being ironic..! [Hangs up.]"
54,2,8,Officer Barbrady,"[Emerging from under her desk.] I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat."
55,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, keep looking. [Pushes him down.]"
56,2,8,Officer Barbrady,Oh?
57,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
58,2,8,Officer Barbrady,"[From under the desk.] Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow."
59,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa-- [Swoons.] Oooooogh..."
60,2,8,Officer Barbrady,I found him.
61,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Man, it's hot out here."
62,2,8,Eric Cartman,What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
63,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks."
64,2,8,Stan Marsh,I know! Let's go sledding!
65,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
66,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Cartman, get on."
67,2,8,Eric Cartman,Stan?
68,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's go, dude. We're ready."
69,2,8,Stan Marsh,"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?"
70,2,8,Eric Cartman,Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
71,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
72,2,8,Eric Cartman,Ugh... Whatever.
73,2,8,Stan Marsh,What the hell is going on?
74,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Hey there, boys!"
75,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
76,2,8,Jimbo Kern,How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
77,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
78,2,8,Jimbo Kern,What?!
79,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year."
80,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Oh my God! [Revs up.] Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case. [Drives off.] Buckle your seat belt, Ned."
81,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmm-where are we going?
82,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"México, my amigo."
83,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmm-why are we going to México?
84,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?"
85,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Are fireworks legal in Mexico?
86,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way."
87,2,8,Charlie,"At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--"
88,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
89,2,8,Charlie,"Oh, o-kay. [To himself.] Let's see..."
90,2,8,Charlie,"Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake."
91,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Ooooh!
92,2,8,Charlie,We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.
93,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,[Writes notes.] Comanche helicopters...
94,2,8,Charlie,"[Flips page.] Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time."
95,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time..."
96,2,8,Charlie,"Once lit, the snake will grow."
97,2,8,Charlie,And good times will be had by all.
98,2,8,Aide 1,Wonderful.
99,2,8,Aide 2,Spectacular.
100,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!"
101,2,8,Aide 1,Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.
102,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
103,2,8,Aide 2,"Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?"
104,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!"
105,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[Singing.]
Dusty the dirtball..."
106,2,8,Stan Marsh,Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
107,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison."
108,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Hello, children. How is your summer going?"
109,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison."
110,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?"
111,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat."
112,2,8,Stan Marsh,That's good.
113,2,8,Mr Garrison,Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
114,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yup.
115,2,8,Mr Garrison,Mr. Hat isn't real.
116,2,8,Stan Marsh,Right.
117,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?"
118,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard."
119,2,8,Eric Cartman,It is not!
120,2,8,Stan Marsh,Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
121,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee."
122,2,8,Eric Cartman,I am not swimming around in pee!
123,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Whatever, dude."
124,2,8,Eric Cartman,"My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday."
125,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[Grins with Stan.] Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics."
126,2,8,Eric Cartman,I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
127,2,8,Stan Marsh,"But Cartman, we're trying to--"
128,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, screw you guys. Home. [Leaves.]"
129,2,8,Stan Marsh,"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?"
130,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always."
131,2,8,Stan Marsh,"There, how does that look?"
132,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
133,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Uh, crap..!"
134,2,8,Eric Cartman,Eh-eh-eh-eh...
135,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"Okay kids, everyone in the pool!"
136,2,8,instructor,"Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now."
137,2,8,Eric Cartman,Nuh-uh.
138,2,8,Swimming Instructor,Just jump in.
139,2,8,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna.
140,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it."
141,2,8,Eric Cartman,Egh--
142,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us."
143,2,8,Eric Cartman,Huh? First graders?
144,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!"
145,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
146,2,8,Aide 2,I'm sure it'll be here any second.
147,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Shut up!
148,2,8,Aide 2,Copy that.
149,2,8,South Park Elementary Orchestra Conductor,"Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?"
150,2,8,Stan Marsh,He's taking swimming lessons.
151,2,8,South Park Elementary Orchestra Conductor,"Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And..."
152,2,8,South Park Elementary Orchestra Conductor,"Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5."
153,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing."
154,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Wait a minute... It's the snake!
155,2,8,Officer Barbrady,"Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all."
156,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!"
157,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr."
158,2,8,Proprietor,¿Qué?
159,2,8,Jimbo Kern,Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr.
160,2,8,Proprietor,¿Necesita usted un cohete grande?
161,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr.
162,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone."
163,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr.
164,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July."
165,2,8,Jimbo Kern,We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
166,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Hmmm-bueyno.
167,2,8,Mr Garrison,Hello?
168,2,8,Caller Mr Mackey,"Hello, is Mr. Hat there?"
169,2,8,Mr Garrison,Is this some kind of joke?
170,2,8,Caller Mr Mackey,[snickers] Yes.
171,2,8,Mr Garrison,You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
172,2,8,Caller Mr Mackey,"I don't think you can, m'kay."
173,2,8,Mr Garrison,Goddammit..!
174,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?"
175,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"Well, I'd like to sing you a song."
176,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"Hey, let's sing one to-gether!"
177,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"As long as we're together,
we can do anything
We can take on the whole darn world
We're happy as clams,
with plenty of pearls
Through thick and thin,
we've always been to-geth-er..."
178,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!
179,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"No! Lamb Chop, no!"
180,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!"
181,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later."
182,2,8,Eric Cartman,Later's fine.
183,2,8,Swimming Instructor,Just do your side stroke.
184,2,8,Eric Cartman,I only know how to do it doggie style.
185,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!"
186,2,8,Eric Cartman,Can I do it doggie style?
187,2,8,Swimming Instructor,Okay.
188,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"That's it! That's it, you can do it!"
189,2,8,Eric Cartman,Sweet..!
190,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!"
191,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"Come on, Eric!"
192,2,8,Eric Cartman,No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
193,2,8,Anchor,"Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name."
194,2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history."
195,2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us."
196,2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Alrighty then, looks like we're ready."
197,2,8,Stan Marsh,"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?"
198,2,8,Eric Cartman,Fine.
199,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
200,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, you heard wrong, hippie!"
201,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!"
202,2,8,South Park Elementary Orchestra Conductor,This is it. And a-one and a-two and a...
203,2,8,Audience,Ooohhhh..!
204,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,What is fuck is that?!
205,2,8,Aide 2,I think it's The Stars and Stripes.
206,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, hell. Light the snake!"
207,2,8,Audience,Ooooooh!
208,2,8,Audience,Ahhhhh!
209,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking."
210,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
211,2,8,Guard,"Good evening, gentlemen."
212,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland."
213,2,8,Guard,"Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions."
214,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Fire away, we have nothing to hide."
215,2,8,Guard,Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
216,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"No, sir."
217,2,8,Guard,Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
218,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Yes. [Ned recoils.] I mean, no! No!"
219,2,8,Guard,"Open your trunk, please, sir."
220,2,8,Jimbo Kern,Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
221,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity."
222,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?"
223,2,8,Charlie,Die out?
224,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, you know, expire, end."
225,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
226,2,8,Charlie,"Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big."
227,2,8,Charlie,"I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?"
228,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,What?!
229,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,[Looking up.] Dude! That thing is huge!
230,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they need to shut it off."
231,2,8,Eric Cartman,[Distracted.] Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!
232,2,8,Man 1,Somebody stop it!
233,2,8,Man 2,It's out of control!
234,2,8,Stan Kyle Cartman,Aarrgghh!!
235,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! Watch out!
236,2,8,Kenny McCormick,(Waarrggh!!)
237,2,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!)"
238,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
239,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
240,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"[Horrified.] Oh my God! [Grabs Charlie.] You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!"
241,2,8,Charlie,Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes... [Mutters indistinctly.]
242,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,So when does it run out?!
243,2,8,Charlie,November. Of next year.
244,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, hell..!"
245,2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work."
246,2,8,Tom Pusslicker,"Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future."
247,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Man, this sucks."
248,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!"
249,2,8,Stan Marsh,We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
250,2,8,Eric Cartman,Where is Chef?
251,2,8,Chef,"[Slowly.]
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-ee
And all that I want to be-ee-ee is...
[Quickly.]
You and me
And her; simultaneous
You and me, and you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three; simultaneous
Ooh, that's right...


[The phone rings and Chef answers it.]
Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what?... A giant snake?... Killing everybody?!... Growing bigger?!... Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, fudge ya.
[He hangs up and resumes singing.]


Simultaneous, you and me
And you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three..."
252,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,What'd he say?
253,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves."
254,2,8,Eric Cartman,Wow.
255,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,How is that gonna help?
256,2,8,Anchor,"All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen."
257,2,8,Preacher,"Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you."
258,2,8,Assistant,"From this day on, all will be well."
259,2,8,New Mormon,I already feel like things are getting better.
260,2,8,Mr Garrison,And I can't sleep or think...
261,2,8,Mr Garrison,Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
262,2,8,Dr Katz,"Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?"
263,2,8,Mr Garrison,"How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?"
264,2,8,Dr Katz,"Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah."
265,2,8,Mr Garrison,"At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning."
266,2,8,Dr Katz,Um... Ahem...
267,2,8,Dr Katz,Are you gay?
268,2,8,Mr Garrison,What?!
269,2,8,Dr Katz,[Stammers.] It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.
270,2,8,Mr Garrison,Are you propositioning me?
271,2,8,Dr Katz,No.
272,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!"
273,2,8,Dr Katz,"Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you."
274,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Hat, on the other hand..."
275,2,8,Dr Katz,Mr. Hat was gay?
276,2,8,Mr Garrison,Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
277,2,8,Dr Katz,I see.
278,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing."
279,2,8,Dr Katz,That I did not need to know.
280,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, I'm just sayin'."
281,2,8,Mr Katz,"Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet."
282,2,8,Dr Katz,What do you think about that?
283,2,8,Mr Garrison,I think you're the loony one in this room.
284,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo."
285,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again."
