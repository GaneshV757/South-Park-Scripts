0,2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!"
1,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
2,2,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
3,2,5,Chef,So let's have half the children on this side [To his right.] and half the children on that side. [To his left]
4,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"[Uncertain.] Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball."
5,2,5,Eric Cartman,[With Clyde and Stan looking on.] What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
6,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--"
7,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball."
8,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, dear."
9,2,5,Stan Marsh,"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins."
10,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, what jolly good fun!"
11,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school."
12,2,5,Chef,[Blows his whistle.] Play ball!
13,2,5,Clyde Donovan,Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
14,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Dammit, we lost one already!"
15,2,5,Chef,"Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh."
16,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup."
17,2,5,Stan Marsh,We're losing men fast out here!
18,2,5,Chef,[Giggling.] Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall!
19,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,I caught it! I caught it!
20,2,5,Chef,"Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!"
21,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Here, Pip, you throw."
22,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't."
23,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?"
24,2,5,Pip Pirrip,I'm not French--
25,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Throw the ball, you stupid frog!"
26,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,"
27,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,you'd be able to-- Ow! [He falls.].
28,2,5,Chef,"Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team."
29,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!"
30,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you."
31,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
32,2,5,Chef,"That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office."
33,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[Gasp.] No. No, it'll be okay!"
34,2,5,Chef,"Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on."
35,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Oh-- Noooo!
36,2,5,Eric Cartman,[Ominously.] Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
37,2,5,Clyde Donovan,I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
38,2,5,Bebe Stevens,I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
39,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?"
40,2,5,Stan Marsh,"[Somberly.] No, Cartman. Nobody ever has."
41,2,5,Nurse Gollum,Are you Kyle Broflovski?
42,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ye-yes.
43,2,5,Nurse Gollum,I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
44,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ye-yes.
45,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you."
46,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,I know.
47,2,5,Nurse Gollum,So open them.
48,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Oh! Phew.
49,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Now, what seems to be the problem?"
50,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball."
51,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack."
52,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,AAGGGGGHHHH!!
53,2,5,Nurse Gollum,What?
54,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
55,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head."
56,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
57,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled."
58,2,5,Boys,Eewwww!
59,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?"
60,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,No. No-it looked dead.
61,2,5,Boys,Eewwww!
62,2,5,Stan Marsh,Wa-was it wearing clothes?
63,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?"
64,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah. Eeww."
65,2,5,Boys,Eewwww!
66,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,And then she walked over to--
67,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called ""conjoined twin myslexia""."
68,2,5,Eric Cartman,Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
69,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys."
70,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins."
71,2,5,The Boys,Gross!
72,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached."
73,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it!"
74,2,5,Stan Marsh,AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
75,2,5,Eric Cartman,AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
76,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?"
77,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Uhhhh... Yeah.
78,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?"
79,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,Mm-hmm.
80,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day..."
81,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,Mm-hmm.
82,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Hello?
83,2,5,Sharon Marsh,"Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother."
84,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon."
85,2,5,Sharon Marsh,"Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?"
86,2,5,Stan Marsh,No! I have to get it out!
87,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia."
88,2,5,Sharon Marsh,So this is your fault.
89,2,5,Stan Marsh,ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
90,2,5,Randy Marsh,"Damn it, stop."
91,2,5,Randy Marsh,Oh!
92,2,5,Randy Marsh,Damn it!
93,2,5,Sharon Marsh,"Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?"
94,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,[Undaunted.] That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
95,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,Mm-hmm.
96,2,5,Stan Marsh,"[To Cartman.] Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?"
97,2,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
98,2,5,Chef,[Arriving with a letter.] Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
99,2,5,All,Awww...
100,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw, do we have to?"
101,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
102,2,5,Chef,"You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!"
103,2,5,Eric Cartman,Heyh! They have a zoo there!
104,2,5,Chef,"That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!"
105,2,5,Stan Marsh,Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
106,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?"
107,2,5,Pip Pirrip,I'd love to!
108,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy."
109,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.
110,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"And besides, I hate French people."
111,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?"
112,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
113,2,5,Principal Victoria,O-of course you do.
114,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,I want to talk to you all about your school nurse.
115,2,5,Mr Mackey,"Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--"
116,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of."
117,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh, and uh, what disease is that?"
118,2,5,Mr Mackey,"Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia."
119,2,5,Principal Victoria,What's that?
120,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
121,2,5,Principal Victoria,[Gasp.] She does?
122,2,5,Mr Mackey,Y-you never noticed that?
123,2,5,Principal Victoria,"No-o, I never did."
124,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!"
125,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?"
126,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
127,2,5,Mr Mackey,Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
128,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00?"
129,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Wonderful!
130,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?"
131,2,5,Chef,"[Rising.] Okay children. [Encouraging] Now, who's gonna win the State Finals?"
132,2,5,Clyde Donovan,Denver?
133,2,5,Chef,"Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!"
134,2,5,Chef,I think we need to get off on this exit.
135,2,5,Mrs Crabtre,"SIT DOWN, KID!!"
136,2,5,Chef,But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
137,2,5,Ms Crabtree,DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!
138,2,5,Chef,"How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!"
139,2,5,Ms Crabtree,I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!
140,2,5,Chef,"[Sits down.] Yes, ma'am."
141,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude, this is a school?"
142,2,5,Bob Thomas,"Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars."
143,2,5,Chef,"I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows."
144,2,5,Bob Thomas,"Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are."
145,2,5,Bob Thomas,"You're from South Park, yeah?"
146,2,5,Chef,[In a low tone.] Yeah.
147,2,5,Bob Thomas,"My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful."
148,2,5,Referee,Play ball!
149,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?"
150,2,5,Nurse Gollum,Colorado State.
151,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Ahhh.
152,2,5,Principal Victoria,Oh.
153,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?"
154,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,"I mean, gravy."
155,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,Ow!
156,2,5,Token Black,Ow!
157,2,5,Chef,"Dammit, come on!"
158,2,5,Chef,Somebody catch the ball!
159,2,5,Bob Thomas,"All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go!"
160,2,5,Eric Cartman,"I caught it, I caught it!"
161,2,5,Player 1,"Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!"
162,2,5,Referee 2,South Park on offense!
163,2,5,Chef,"Great job, children! Just stay focused now."
164,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Go for it, Pip."
165,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, bother."
166,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, you Frenchy little frog!"
167,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Gagghh!
168,2,5,Chef,"Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!"
169,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight."
170,2,5,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?"
171,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!"
172,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Gerald!
173,2,5,Shiela,Keep your damn mouth shut!
174,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really."
175,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"[Exhales.] Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum."
176,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"No, I'm quite secure with it."
177,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
178,2,5,Nurse Gollum,They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
179,2,5,Mr Mackey,Could I get some more pork?
180,2,5,Principal Victoria,"So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?"
181,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death."
182,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?"
183,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"No, really, I don't need a--"
184,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop."
185,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person."
186,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
187,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring."
188,2,5,Nurse Gollum,But I really don't think--
189,2,5,Mr Mackey,"Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?"
190,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now!"
191,2,5,Chef,"You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions."
192,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap."
193,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Get him, Frenchy!"
194,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Gaagghh!
195,2,5,Referee 2,South Park wins!
196,2,5,Chef,"We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!"
197,2,5,Player 6,Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!
198,2,5,Player 6,It hur-hurts! Owieee!
199,2,5,Player 6,"Mommy, it huurts! I-it hur-hurts!"
200,2,5,Chef,"Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!

Oooh, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red"
201,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals..."
202,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.
203,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!"
204,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!"
205,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,Let's hear it for these brave souls!
206,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!
207,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job."
208,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,[The mic is still on.] Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
209,2,5,Chef,"How much further is Washington, D.C.?"
210,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,"SIT DOWN, KID!!"
211,2,5,Chef,"I need to know how far it is, lady!"
212,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,I SAID SIT DOWN!!!
213,2,5,Chef,"[Grumbling.] Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog."
214,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
215,2,5,Chef,"I said, ""I've always wanted to visit Prague."""
216,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,"Oh, me too."
217,2,5,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] Okay, what have you got?"
218,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Some hadka fish, some gafagga..."
219,2,5,Eric Cartman,[Quickly.] I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!
220,2,5,Stan Marsh,Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!
221,2,5,Stan Marsh,Places!
222,2,5,Ms Crabtree,ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!
223,2,5,Kids,Whoa!
224,2,5,Kenny McCormick,(Sheesh!)
225,2,5,Chef,"Damn, man. This is the big time, alright."
226,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we're hungry."
227,2,5,Chef,"You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese."
228,2,5,Eric Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
229,2,5,Chef,What?
230,2,5,Referee,Are you Chef?
231,2,5,Chef,Yeah.
232,2,5,Referee,"The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions."
233,2,5,Chef,"What? We did it! Children, we won!"
234,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that was easy."
235,2,5,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows!"
236,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, why did you guys forfeit?"
237,2,5,Player,You mean you don't know?
238,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Know what?
239,2,5,Player,Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.
240,2,5,Master,Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!
241,2,5,Player,"[Voice-over.] They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals."
242,2,5,Player,"Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about."
243,2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, back in the bus."
244,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison."
245,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, no..!"
246,2,5,Singer,"[The video begins.]

You've got the strength, you've got the courage
Even with a dead fetus on your head
You carry on
You fight for tomorrow
Dead fetus or no, you never let go
You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman"
247,2,5,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, that was so touching."
248,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"[With envelope in hand.] And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is... [Reaches into the envelope.]"
249,2,5,Nurse Gollum,[Derisively.] Nurse Gollum.
250,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,Nurse Gollum!!
251,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, boy."
252,2,5,Jimbo Kern,"[Interrupting.] Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in."
253,2,5,Jimbo Kern,"Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China."
254,2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game."
255,2,5,Stan Marsh,"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!"
256,2,5,Chef,"Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions."
257,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,But we could get killed!
258,2,5,Chef,And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?
259,2,5,Chef,"Just imagine: a big yellow ""Dodgeball Champions"" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!"
260,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Chef has lost it."
261,2,5,Chef,"You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!"
262,2,5,Eric Cartman,"So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?"
263,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what does that mean?"
264,2,5,Eric Cartman,I dunno.
265,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?"
266,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you're from China."
267,2,5,Kevin Stoley,"No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese."
268,2,5,Stan Marsh,Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
269,2,5,Kevin Stoley,"I have no idea, dude."
270,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, rice picker!"
271,2,5,Chef,"Hey, hey hey!"
272,2,5,Chef,"Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity."
273,2,5,Stan Marsh,You don't?
274,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people."
275,2,5,Chef,"No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country."
276,2,5,Stan Marsh,Ohhh.
277,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ohhh.
278,2,5,Eric Cartman,"[At the same time.] Oooh, I get it."
279,2,5,Kevin Stoley,[Vindicated.] Yeah.
280,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,[Slamming on the brakes.] AAAGGGGHHHH!
281,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the..."
282,2,5,Chinese Commentator,...champion of dodgeball be deshide!
283,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude. China's fucked up."
284,2,5,Referee,Take places!

314,2,5,Tom,"Yes yes! [Laughs.] Y'all come a-back now, you hear?"
315,2,5,Chef,"[Crestfallen.] Oh, what have I done?"
316,2,5,Chef,"You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good."
317,2,5,Chef,"If we had won the world championship, what then?"
318,2,5,Chef,It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.
319,2,5,Chef,"Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?"
320,2,5,Chef,"Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home."
321,2,5,Chinese kid,Come on! Throw ball!
322,2,5,Kevin Stoley,"[Walking over to player 70.] Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this."
323,2,5,Player 7,"Thanks, you American dumbass! [Reads it.] ""You French piece of crap! Throw ball!"""

327,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day!"
328,2,5,Chef,"Shut up, Pip."
329,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, shut up, Pip. [To Chef.] Can we go home now?"
330,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
331,2,5,Kids,"Shut up, Pip!"
332,2,5,Chef,"Shut up, Pip!"
333,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation."
334,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!"
335,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
336,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!"
337,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Agghh!
338,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's the freak nurse!"
339,2,5,Eric Cartman,Holy crap!
340,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!"
341,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well sorry, dude, we weren't here."
342,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week."
343,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,[Wiping away a tear.] She's really touched.
344,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks!"
345,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--"
346,2,5,Nurse Gollum,Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?
347,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long."
348,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other."
349,2,5,Nurse gollum,And take those stupid things off your heads!
350,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch."
351,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah, the nerve of some people."
352,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool."
353,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter."
354,2,5,Eric Cartman,I love you guys.
355,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Ah, screw you guys!"
