0,2,2,Announcer 2,"Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy."
1,2,2,Announcer 1,"Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer."
2,2,2,Mephesto,"And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room."
3,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life."
4,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Oooh- hey, Kenny."
5,2,2,Mephesto,"Gentlemen, the father is..."
6,2,2,Mr Garrison,"Hey, what the hell's going on?"
7,2,2,Jimbo Kern,It's a power outage!
8,2,2,Chef,Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
9,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Oh my God, look!"
10,2,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)"
11,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
12,2,2,Mr Garrison,Mephesto's been shot.
13,2,2,Chef,Is he ...dead?
14,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!"
15,2,2,Mr Garrison,Then who was it?
16,2,2,Announcer 1,Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
17,2,2,Eric Cartman,Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
18,2,2,Announcer 1,Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
19,2,2,Chef,[Listening to Mephesto's chest.] Waait! [Getting up.] He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
20,2,2,Eric Cartman,[Grabbing Mephesto's shirt.] Goddammit! Who's my father?
21,2,2,Chef,[About to lift Mephesto.] We've got to get him to the hospital.
22,2,2,Eric Cartman,You've got to be kidding me!
23,2,2,Chef,"Come on, children!"
24,2,2,Eric Cartman,Eeeehh..!
25,2,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this."
26,2,2,Jimbo Kern,There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
27,2,2,Mr Garrison,Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
28,2,2,Announcer 1,Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
29,2,2,Eric Cartman,Is he awake yet?
30,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,[Checking.] He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
31,2,2,Chef,Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
32,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
33,2,2,Chef,I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to... [Mad at himself.] Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
34,2,2,Stan Marsh,Could you pull over so I can get out?
35,2,2,Chef,What? We have to get to the hospital.
36,2,2,Stan Marsh,I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
37,2,2,Chef,"Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?"
38,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Man, it's really starting to snow."
39,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,I hope they don't close the roads.
40,2,2,Eric Cartman,They can't. Mephesto can't die.
41,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman."
42,2,2,Eric Cartman,"No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, ""Come Sail Away"", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it."
43,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
44,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done."
45,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,I'm sailing away...
46,2,2,Eric Cartman,No! Don't!
47,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,Set an open course for the virgin sea...
48,2,2,Eric Cartman,Eh--
49,2,2,Eric Cartman,"For I've got to be free,
Free to face the life that's ahead of me,
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard,
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore,
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on,
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay,
A gathering of angels appeared above my head,
They sang to us this song of hope,
And this is what they said,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me"
50,2,2,Eric Cartman,"I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads"
51,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
52,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!"
53,2,2,Sheila Broflovski,We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
54,2,2,Sharon,Uh... Where are our children?
55,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?"
56,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking."
57,2,2,Man,Mayor! Mayor!
58,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,[Aside to an aide.] The press is here.
59,2,2,Sid Greenfield,My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
60,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,[Amazed.] Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
61,2,2,Greenfield,We're desperate for stories.
62,2,2,Greenfield,A-and this one is so compelling.
63,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,[Aroused.] Really??
64,2,2,Greenfield,Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
65,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hey, I thought of something. [Close-up.] Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction."
66,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?"
67,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--"
68,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,Shh.
69,2,2,Greenfield,"We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins."
70,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
71,2,2,Greenfield,"Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family."
72,2,2,Boom Mic Operator and Cameraman,It is?
73,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"[Thoughtfully.] Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay!"
74,2,2,Greenfield,Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
75,2,2,Announcer 1,Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
76,2,2,Liane Cartman,I want to have... an abortion.
77,2,2,Receptionist,"Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs..."
78,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world."
79,2,2,Receptionist,"Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?"
80,2,2,Liane Cartman,About eight years ago.
81,2,2,Receptionist,"[Processing.] ...I sseee, so the fetus is..."
82,2,2,Liane Cartman,Eight years old.
83,2,2,Receptionist,"Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion."
84,2,2,Liane Cartman,Really?
85,2,2,Receptionist,"Yes, this is what we would refer to as the ""fortieth trimester""."
86,2,2,Liane Cartman,But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
87,2,2,Receptionist,"Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester."
88,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body."
89,2,2,Receptionist,"Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman."
90,2,2,Liane Cartman,"[Rises from the chair.] Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day!"
91,2,2,Chef,"Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! [Kenny follows him in.]"
92,2,2,Stan Marsh,"[Stops.] Ugh. I can't do it, dude. [Kyle and Cartman pass him.]"
93,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad."
94,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, stop being a wuss!"
95,2,2,Chef,Doctor!
96,2,2,Dr Doctor,"One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat!"
97,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!"
98,2,2,Dr Doctor,"We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son."
99,2,2,Chef,Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
100,2,2,Dr Doctor,"I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle."
101,2,2,Stan Marsh,[Pained.] Oh man. [Grabs his stomach.] I'm gonna be sick.
102,2,2,Dr Doctor,"There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of."
103,2,2,Stan Marsh,Oogh.
104,2,2,Nurse Goodly,"Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone."
105,2,2,Stan Marsh,Ooooogh.
106,2,2,Dr Doctor,Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.
107,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Oops, he's hemorrhaging."
108,2,2,Stan Marsh,Aghh!
109,2,2,Dr Doctor,[Plop.] Ooo! His head fell off.
110,2,2,Stan Marsh,I'm gotta get outta here!
111,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,Stan!
112,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach."
113,2,2,Mephesto Tryout,"And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot! [Drops the cane.]"
114,2,2,Greenfield,"Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you. [The actor departs.] I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Mister-uhh Garrison."
115,2,2,Director's Assistant,Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
116,2,2,Garrison 1,"Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
117,2,2,Mr Hat 1,"[Just a sock with two purple disks for eyes.] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!"
118,2,2,Greenfield,"Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!"
119,2,2,Mr Garrison,"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
120,2,2,Mr Hat,"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!"
121,2,2,Greenfield,Thank you! Next!
122,2,2,Mr Garrison,[Shocked.] What?
123,2,2,Greenfield,Next!
124,2,2,Garrison 2,"[An actor with a deep voice.] I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
125,2,2,Mr Hat 2,"[A fist with a face drawn on it.] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
126,2,2,Greenfield,Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!
127,2,2,Liane Cartman,"...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed."
128,2,2,O Reilly,"Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th."
129,2,2,Liane Cartman,But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
130,2,2,O Reilly,"No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff."
131,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, dear."
132,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Well, this is about all I can do for him."
133,2,2,Eric Cartman,Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
134,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Sorry, son, it might be a while."
135,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Wake up, you son of a bitch!"
136,2,2,Chef,Whoa!
137,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition."
138,2,2,Eric Cartman,I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
139,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Cartman."
140,2,2,Eric Cartman,What?
141,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,I'm sailing ay...
142,2,2,Eric Cartman,"--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard..."
143,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Okay okay, let's get outta here now!"
144,2,2,Eric Cartman,...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...
145,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,[Looking out at the snow storm.] I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.
146,2,2,Eric Cartman,"...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on..."
147,2,2,Dr Doctor,"My God, that's a hell of a storm."
148,2,2,Eric Cartman,"I look to the sea; Reflections--
--in the waves spark my memory..."
149,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, weak."
150,2,2,Eric Cartman,"...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--"
151,2,2,Greenfield,"God, I hate mountains. This better not push back our shooting schedule."
152,2,2,Greenfield,"Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it."
153,2,2,Greenfield,Who's that?
154,2,2,Director's Assistant,"Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy."
155,2,2,Greenfield,"Whoa. Talk about ""all washed-up"", huh? Great to have you, Eric!"
156,2,2,Greenfield,"Here we go, aaand action."
157,2,2,Mephesto Actor,I want to announce who the father is.
158,2,2,Greenfield,Bang!!
159,2,2,Mephesto Actor,"Oh, I've been shot! [Falls over.]"
160,2,2,Barbrady Actor,Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
161,2,2,Chef Actor,"My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!"
162,2,2,Mephesto Actor,[As Chef Actor speaks] Whoaw..!
163,2,2,Barbrady Actor,"You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef."
164,2,2,Chef Actor,"Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!"
165,2,2,Barbrady Actor,"Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job."
166,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Whoa, this is a good movie!"
167,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee"
168,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?"
169,2,2,Blonde,"Doctor, I can't focus!"
170,2,2,Dr Doctor,"We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly."
171,2,2,Chef,Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
172,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked."
173,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Metaphorically speaking, that is."
174,2,2,Eric Cartman,What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
175,2,2,Dr Doctor,He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.
176,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?"
177,2,2,Voice over,"Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your host, John Walsh."
178,2,2,John Walsh,"Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto [His picture appears.] was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructed this heinous crime [The South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch is seen.] in hopes that your calls could help solve the case."
179,2,2,Mephesto Actor,[Pfff. The actors flinch and he throws away the cane] I've been shot!
180,2,2,Garrison Actor,"[Catches him.] My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!"
181,2,2,Mr Hat Actor,"Right away, Mr. Garrison."
182,2,2,Eric Roberts as Kevin,"No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?"
183,2,2,Greenfield,What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
184,2,2,Chef Actor,I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
185,2,2,Eric Roberts,This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
186,2,2,Greenfield,God-dammit!
187,2,2,Greenfield,What the hell is this?!
188,2,2,Boom Mic Operator and Cameraman,We've lost the feed to L.A.
189,2,2,John Walsh,"Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit."
190,2,2,Announcer 1,Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
191,2,2,Greenfield,Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!
192,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!"
193,2,2,Nurse Goodly,"Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine."
194,2,2,Dr Doctor,"[Opening the operating room doors wide.] Nurse, I could use some help in here!"
195,2,2,Nurse Goodly,Coming!
196,2,2,Eric Cartman,Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
197,2,2,Nurse Goodly,"Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short."
198,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!"
199,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Oh, sorry."
200,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one."
201,2,2,Governor,"[Smoking.] Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm."
202,2,2,Liane Cartman,"I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know..."
203,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly."
204,2,2,Chef,What do you want me to do?
205,2,2,Dr Doctor,Do you know anything about surgery?
206,2,2,Chef,I used to watch Quincy.
207,2,2,Dr Doctor,"What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives."
208,2,2,Stan Marsh,"No way, dude!"
209,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Well, [Opens his right eye.] we're not going anywhere for a loong time."
210,2,2,Greenfield,We're snowed in?
211,2,2,Mayor McDaneils,Yes. We're trapped!
212,2,2,Mr Garrison,[Snuggling up to Greenfield.] Like sailors on a submarine.
213,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen."
214,2,2,Director's Assistant,"Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast."
215,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too. [Rubs his belly.]"
216,2,2,Jimbo Kern,I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.
217,2,2,Jimbo Kern,Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive.
218,2,2,Greenfield,"Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?"
219,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it."
220,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Buut, how do we decide ""who""?"
221,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Well, we draw straws."
222,2,2,Greenfield,"Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?"
223,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws."
224,2,2,Greenfield,Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
225,2,2,Announcer 1,Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
226,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me. [Stan raises his brows.] Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms. [He withdraws.] Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?"
227,2,2,Stan Marsh,No.
228,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart."
229,2,2,Stan Marsh,[Queasily.] Oh boy.
230,2,2,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
231,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
232,2,2,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
233,2,2,Dr Doctor,Suction!
234,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey, who's screwing with the lights?"
235,2,2,Announcer 1,Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
236,2,2,Eric Cartman,[To Kenny.] That is really starting to piss me off.
237,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing. [Draws.] Whew."
238,2,2,Mr Garrison,[Draws] Whew.
239,2,2,Officer Barbrady,Wooo!
240,2,2,Jimbo Kern,Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
241,2,2,Officer Barbrady,The short what?
242,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!"
243,2,2,Officer Barbrady,That's not how I played it!
244,2,2,Mr Garrison,"Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling."
245,2,2,Dr Doctor,"I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital."
246,2,2,Chef,So how do we get to it?
247,2,2,Dr Doctor,"We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny."
248,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct."
249,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here [Points to it.] where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here."
250,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?"
251,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me."
252,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!"
253,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Huh?)
254,2,2,Mr Garrison,I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
255,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,We're all going to die in this horrible place. [She covers her eyes.]
256,2,2,Jimbo Kern,We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
257,2,2,Greenfield,How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
258,2,2,Jimbo Kern,There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts. [He's shown squatting on the floor.]
259,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"[Thoughtfully.] Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts."
260,2,2,Mr Garrison,[Madly] Eat Eric Roberts!
261,2,2,Eric Roberts,"No! No, please!"
262,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, there's no going back now. [Ned and Jimbo keep eating.] We're cannibals. [Someone burps.] God save us."
263,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!"
264,2,2,Director's Assistant,"[Coolly.] Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected."
265,2,2,Greenfield,[Miffed.] Aaww.
266,2,2,Mr Garrison,"This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it."
267,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"What time is it, Barbrady?"
268,2,2,Officer Barbrady,It's almost midnight.
269,2,2,Mr Garrison,Oh! I can't... go on. [Drops to his side.]
270,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again."
271,2,2,Greenfield,"What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?"
272,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Team B? Come in, Team B."
273,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(This is Team B.)
274,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage."
275,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
276,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left."
277,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Yup! I see it in the drift.)
278,2,2,Dr Doctor,Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
279,2,2,Eric Cartman,"What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?"
280,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive."
281,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who."
282,2,2,Announcer 1,Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
283,2,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Okay, I've reached the generator)"
284,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Roger, Team B. [To Team A.] He's reached the backup generator. [To Kenny.] Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?"
285,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Roger.)
286,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?"
287,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Negative.)
288,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed."
289,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,D'you have any wire here?
290,2,2,Dr Doctor,There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
291,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(I'll stick 'em together)
292,2,2,Dr Doctor,"No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands."
293,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, he'll die!"
294,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Go, Kenny!"
295,2,2,Dr Doctor,Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
296,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
297,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
298,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
299,2,2,Chef,The power!
300,2,2,Dr Doctor,Quickly! Get the scanner running again!
301,2,2,Dr Doctor,We've got a chance now!
302,2,2,President Bill Clinton,"Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you."
303,2,2,Liane Cartman,"[Relieved and joyful.] Oh, thank you, thank you."
304,2,2,Bill Clinton,We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately. [Her eyes widen.]
305,2,2,Liane Cartman,[Pulls back.] Terminated?
306,2,2,Bill Clinton,"Why yes, that's what an abortion is."
307,2,2,Liane Cartman,Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
308,2,2,Bill Clinton,Adoption?
309,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption."
310,2,2,Bill Clinton,"Well, that's- pretty different."
311,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President."
312,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine."
313,2,2,Mephesto,[Coming to.] Where... where am I?
314,2,2,Chef,"You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--"
315,2,2,Mephesto,Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
316,2,2,Chef,Ooohhh.
317,2,2,Dr Doctor,Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
318,2,2,Chef,He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
319,2,2,Stan Marsh,"He was a good friend, and I'll miss him."
320,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
321,2,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
322,2,2,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?"
323,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know. Let's find out.
324,2,2,Mr Garrison,Ohh. It's over! We're free!
325,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?"
326,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there."
327,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
328,2,2,Ned Gerblansky,"Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time."
329,2,2,Singer,"[A la Aaron Neville]
Ave Maria...

[The camera pulls back, and back...]"
330,2,2,Mr Garrison,"Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?"
331,2,2,Mephesto,"I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--"
332,2,2,Eric Cartman,Just tell us already!
333,2,2,Mephesto,"Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--"
334,2,2,Eric Cartman,[Boiling.] Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
335,2,2,Mephesto,"Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. [All gasp.]"
336,2,2,Chef,What???
337,2,2,Liane Cartman,"[Back with her cookies.] Yes, it's true."
338,2,2,Mr Garrison,"Noo, that doesn't make sense!"
339,2,2,Mephesto,"Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. [She looks guilty.]"
340,2,2,Mr Garrison,Uh-meaning what?
341,2,2,Mephesto,Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
342,2,2,Liane Cartman,It's true.
343,2,2,Chef,"You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!"
344,2,2,Mephesto,"No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis."
345,2,2,Mephesto,"The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance."
346,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak."
347,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!"
348,2,2,Liane Cartman,"I'm sorry I never told you, Eric."
349,2,2,Liane Cartman,"I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you."
350,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!"
351,2,2,Mephesto,"Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing."
352,2,2,Eric Cartman,"No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!"
353,2,2,Announcer 1,Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
354,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Ooohhh, forget it!"
