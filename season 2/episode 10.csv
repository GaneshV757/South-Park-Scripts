0,2,10,Dr Doctor,It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
1,2,10,Sharon Marsh,But what's wrong with her?
2,2,10,Dr Doctor,"It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?"
3,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"No, no, she's been perfectly healthy."
4,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease."
5,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Sweetly.] Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan."
6,2,10,Shelly Marsh,"[In disgust.] Oh, whoo-peee!"
7,2,10,Dr Doctor,"You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes."
8,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you've got herpes on your face!"
9,2,10,Shelly Marsh,"Shut up, brat!"
10,2,10,Sharon Marsh,[With some urgency.] Will my daughter be okay?
11,2,10,Dr Doctor,She'll be fine.
12,2,10,Shelly Marsh,[Stan scratches her cheek.] Stop it!
13,2,10,Dr Doctor,We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
14,2,10,Stan Marsh,Ow!
15,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go."
16,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die."
17,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness."
18,2,10,Liane Cartman,I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
19,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young."
20,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time."
21,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it."
22,2,10,Sharon Marsh,So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
23,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now."
24,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Are you guys having a meeting or something?
25,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
26,2,10,Eric Cartman,"No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto."
27,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
28,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final."
29,2,10,Eric Cartman,Oh weak!
30,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
31,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's pretty weird."
32,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo."
33,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, here's Kenny's house."
34,2,10,Eric Cartman,"In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto"
35,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Yeah?
36,2,10,Stan Marsh,We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
37,2,10,Stuart McCormick,What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?
38,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"[Intruding.] That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young."
39,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Oh yeah.
40,2,10,Stan Marsh,Catch what?
41,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner."
42,2,10,Eric Cartman,"And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto"
43,2,10,Stan Marsh,Sshh! Cartman!
44,2,10,Eric Cartman,What?
45,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"[Setting the table.] Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!"
46,2,10,Kenny McCormick,"(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)"
47,2,10,Mrs McCormick,I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
48,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Heheheh, buns."
49,2,10,Kenny McCormick,"[Walks up to the other boys.] (Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)"
50,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!"
51,2,10,Eric Cartman,[Scanning the room.] Where is the Nintendo?
52,2,10,Stuart McCormick,We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.
53,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
54,2,10,Mrs McCormick,[Now finished setting table.] Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
55,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, good. I'm starving."
56,2,10,Mrs McCormick,Let's say grace.
57,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen."
58,2,10,All,Amen.
59,2,10,Eric Cartman,Pfff..!
60,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Okay, let's dig in."
61,2,10,Kevin McCormick,"That one's mine, that one's mine!"
62,2,10,Eric Cartman,[Coolly.] What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?
63,2,10,Eric Cartman,Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
64,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?"
65,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
66,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Stuart, don't even get started!"
67,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"[To his wife.] What? I'm just askin' a question. [To Kyle.] You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!"
68,2,10,Eric Cartman,Puh! I heard that.
69,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"That ain't why, Stuart! [Sadness creeps into her voice.] It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!"
70,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!"
71,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!"
72,2,10,Stuart McCormick,You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
73,2,10,Kevin McCormick,"[Gleefully.] My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!"
74,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother."
75,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?"
76,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"Hey! We don't say ""fuck"" at the table, you little asshole!"
77,2,10,Eric Cartman,"[Hushed.] Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either."
78,2,10,Kenny McCormick,(Aa-choo!)
79,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them."
80,2,10,Stan Marsh,Huh?
81,2,10,Kenny McCormick,[Turning towards Cartman.] (Waa-choo!)
82,2,10,Eric Cartman,[Recoiling.] Ey!
83,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?"
84,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
85,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell is that?"
86,2,10,Eric Cartman,It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
87,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's not cool!"
88,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I think I just saw a rat!"
89,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!"
90,2,10,Kenny McCormick,(Uh-huh.)
91,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha."
92,2,10,Stan Marsh,I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
93,2,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)"
94,2,10,Stan Marsh,Oh.
95,2,10,Kenny McCormick,(Aa-choo!)
96,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, lemme see."
97,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, goody! You've got a fever!"
98,2,10,Stan Marsh,"[Mad.] Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!"
99,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright."
100,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night."
101,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, gee, I guess you did."
102,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, you sure seem happy about it!"
103,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"All right, it's off to bed with you, young man."
104,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Don't scratch it, hon."
105,2,10,Eric Cartman,"[Whining.] But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!"
106,2,10,Liane Cartman,"No, hon."
107,2,10,Eric Cartman,"[Whining.] Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!"
108,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Here, I got you some calamine lotion."
109,2,10,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna.
110,2,10,Liane Cartman,It'll make your itches go away.
111,2,10,Eric Cartman,Ugh. Uunnh.
112,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Ey, give me that!"
113,2,10,Eric Cartman,Ahhhh...
114,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad."
115,2,10,Eric Cartman,More calamine lotion!
116,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
117,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I feel great!
118,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
119,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast."
120,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Did you sleep in the same room?
121,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. Why?
122,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?"
123,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!"
124,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
125,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him."
126,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
127,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
128,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were."
129,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?"
130,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do."
131,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?"
132,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son."
133,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods."
134,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Gods and clods?
135,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down."
136,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!"
137,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America."
138,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Enters.] Stanley, can I get you anything else?"
139,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!"
140,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay."
141,2,10,Dr Doctor,[Entering.] Can I talk to you outside?
142,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?"
143,2,10,Stan Marsh,Okay.
144,2,10,Shelly Marsh,"[Now that they're alone.] Serves you right, you little brat!"
145,2,10,Stan Marsh,Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
146,2,10,Shelly Marsh,"If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!"
147,2,10,TV Voice,"[""Passion Cramps""] Will Carol find out she's a fa..."
148,2,10,Stan Marsh,I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
149,2,10,Shelly Marsh,[Threatening] We're watching this!
150,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. [Click.]"
151,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?"
152,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Sure thing, Phillip."
153,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!"
154,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,That's tomfoolery.
155,2,10,Shelly Marsh,Give me the remote!
156,2,10,Stan Marsh,"No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day--"
157,2,10,Stan Marsh,Ey! Get me out of here!
158,2,10,TV Voice,"[""Passion Cramps""] She was..."
159,2,10,Dr Doctor,"He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while."
160,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Anxious.] Oh God, what have we done?"
161,2,10,Dr Doctor,"There there now, it's not your fault."
162,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early."
163,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck."
164,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Could we go home now, Ma?"
165,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more."
166,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
167,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"I've got a great game for you. It's called ""ookie mouth""."
168,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What's ""ookie mouth""?"
169,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say ""ookie mouth"" at the same time."
170,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Sick, dude!"
171,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it."
172,2,10,Shiela,That ought to take care of it.
173,2,10,Mrs McCormick,You want some more hot water?
174,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?"
175,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity rich folk stuff."
176,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick."
177,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!"
178,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
179,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ookie mouth! [Kenny spits in.] Gross! I can't do it, Ma!"
180,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Try again, bubbe!"
181,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Argh!
182,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers."
183,2,10,Mrs McCormick,Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
184,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?"
185,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself."
186,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
187,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd."
188,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
189,2,10,Mrs McCormick,Uh-I don't know.
190,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
191,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible."
192,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Practice makes perfect, bubbe."
193,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!"
194,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"[With clipboard.] Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news."
195,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Give it to me straight, Terrance."
196,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"The good news is, you have a clean bill of health."
197,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Oh, what a relief!"
198,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"The bad news is, you have cancer."
199,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Cancer?
200,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
201,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,My ass is collapsing?
202,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Yes. See this X-ray? [Turns it on.] That's your ass. See this line? [Points to it.] That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
203,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
204,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore."
205,2,10,Eric Cartman,"[Somber.] Oh, no. [The itching returns.] Damnit!"
206,2,10,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!"
207,2,10,Eric Cartman,Uh. Yes. Uh...
208,2,10,Liane Cartman,"[Closing a door.] I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion."
209,2,10,Eric Cartman,[Releases Mr. Kitty.] It's about friggin' time! Give me that!
210,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while."
211,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Uugh! Yeessss. [His voice trails off.] Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh..."
212,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry."
213,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh..."
214,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Tackle box?
215,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, tackle box. [Stretches.] Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?"
216,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless."
217,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Right. Right-right.
218,2,10,Mr Garrison,"And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?"
219,2,10,Mr Garrison,"Yes, Kyle?"
220,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell does that have to do with American history?
221,2,10,Mr Garrison,"Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?"
222,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes."
223,2,10,Mr Garrison,"Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, ""How I would make America better."""
224,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?"
225,2,10,Mr Garrison,"Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too."
226,2,10,Stan Marsh,Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
227,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick."
228,2,10,Stan Marsh,That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
229,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good."
230,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo."
231,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it's-it's true, he is."
232,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper."
233,2,10,Stan Marsh,Wait! Where are you going?
234,2,10,Randy Marsh,We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
235,2,10,Stan Marsh,Milkshakes?!
236,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, and then we're going to the movies."
237,2,10,Randy Marsh,"See ya, son. [They leave.]"
238,2,10,Stan Marsh,Weak!
239,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."""
240,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy."
241,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
242,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Softly.] What?
243,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it."
244,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Frightened.] Oh my God!
245,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Turns.] Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?"
246,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Angry.] You!
247,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Subdued.] I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz."
248,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,You!
249,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Walks over.] What, bubbeleh, what is it?"
250,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
251,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young."
252,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!"
253,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Now, Kyle, come here."
254,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You get away from me, you crazy woman!"
255,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Hoh boy.
256,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Beer?
257,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries."
258,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?"
259,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
260,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
261,2,10,Stuart McCormick,[Soberly.] That's where I live now.
262,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, right."
263,2,10,Stan Marsh,And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
264,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Rushing in.] Stan! Stan!
265,2,10,Stan Marsh,[Pointing to Shelly.] Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
266,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[Softly.] Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?"
267,2,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
268,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
269,2,10,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about?
270,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway."
271,2,10,Stan Marsh,They did?
272,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
273,2,10,Stan Marsh,Why?
274,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Because they're a bunch of assholes.
275,2,10,Stan Marsh,[Long gasp.] Of course!
276,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!"
277,2,10,Eric Cartman,"""I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."""
278,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Mom, answer that! ""They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."""
279,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?"
280,2,10,Eric Cartman,I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
281,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!"
282,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face."
283,2,10,Eric Cartman,She what?!
284,2,10,Stan Marsh,It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
285,2,10,Eric Cartman,That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
286,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back."
287,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along."
288,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Not that easy. You were lucky.
289,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky."
290,2,10,Stuart McCormick,You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
291,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today! [Rising.] I wanted to be somebody!
292,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"[Rising.] I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!"
293,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!"
294,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Ow!! [Gets up.]
295,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Now don't make me do that again!
296,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Ow! You son of a bitch!
297,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Uh!
298,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Ow!
299,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Oh!
300,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Ow!
301,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Eeaagghh!
302,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,[In pain.] Huuuh!
303,2,10,Randy Marsh,Doctor?
304,2,10,Dr Doctor,Yes?
305,2,10,Randy Marsh,Wh-where's Stan?
306,2,10,Dr Doctor,Stan?
307,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Stan, our son?"
308,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Oh, yes. Where is Stan?"
309,2,10,Sharon Marsh,You mean Stanley's missing?
310,2,10,Dr Doctor,"No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment."
311,2,10,Sharon Marsh,[To Randy.] Oh my God! Our son ran away!
312,2,10,Randy Marsh,Will he be okay out of the hospital?
313,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die."
314,2,10,Sharon Marsh,Die?
315,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs."
316,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Okay, well well, let's go look--"
317,2,10,Dr Doctor,"As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny."
318,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oh God, no!"
319,2,10,Randy Marsh,I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
320,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--"
321,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
322,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,That son of a bitch ripped my parka!
323,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Catch anything?
324,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,I just don't get it.
325,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
326,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up."
327,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
328,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,I thought it would be good for you.
329,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
330,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Exasperated, she leaves.] I'm doing the best I can!"
331,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,What?!
332,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, God, what have I done?"
333,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"What's happening here, Terrance?"
334,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
335,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Who's the donor?
336,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"I am, Phillip. I am."
337,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?"
338,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass."
339,2,10,Chef,"Oh, damn it, not now!"
340,2,10,Chef,"Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!"
341,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, we wanna know about herpes."
342,2,10,Chef,What makes you think I would know anything about that?
343,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
344,2,10,Stan Marsh,How does someone get herpes?
345,2,10,Chef,Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
346,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Do you know anybody with herpes?
347,2,10,Chef,"Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her."
348,2,10,Stan Marsh,But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
349,2,10,Chef,"Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to."
350,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cool! Thanks, Chef!"
351,2,10,Chef,O-kay!
352,2,10,Chef,Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
353,2,10,Sharon Marsh,Stanley?
354,2,10,Randy Marsh,Stan?
355,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Softly.] Oh, Stanley, where are you..?"
356,2,10,Randy Marsh,Stan?
357,2,10,Sharon Marsh,Stanley!
358,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Are you old Frida?
359,2,10,Frida,[Raspily.] Who wants to know?
360,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Someone who wants a favor.
361,2,10,Frida,"Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b-- [Snorts.]"
362,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[To Stan, throws his hands up.] Huh?"
363,2,10,Eric Cartman,We want you to give our parents herpes.
364,2,10,Frida,[Puffs out.] Five dollars.
365,2,10,Stan Marsh,My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. [Coughs.]
366,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital."
367,2,10,Stan Marsh,"And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do."
368,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Thanks a lot, Frida!"
369,2,10,Frida,[Hacks.] Don't mention it.
370,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!"
371,2,10,Boys,Hooray!
372,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, where the hell have you been?"
373,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!"
374,2,10,Stan Marsh,[Hiding behind Kyle.] I don't wanna go back there.
375,2,10,Randy Marsh,"[Coming for him.] Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital."
376,2,10,Stan Marsh,Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
377,2,10,Randy Marsh,What?
378,2,10,Stan Marsh,"You know, freshen up your breath."
379,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, man. [Tottering, eyes half shut.] I don't feel so good."
380,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Pleased.] Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--"
381,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh...
382,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle!!
383,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all."
384,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,We're sorry.
385,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in."
386,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman."
387,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Hell no, you guys get your own!"
388,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?"
389,2,10,Stan Marsh,Pretty good.
390,2,10,Sharon Marsh,[Cheerfully.] The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
391,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?"
392,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Wow, coo-hul!"
393,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"And how are you, Kyle?"
394,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Are you doing okay?
395,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,I'm better now.
396,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"What's so funny, you two?"
397,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,We gave you guys herpes.
398,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!
399,2,10,Stan Marsh,We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
400,2,10,Randy Marsh,I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
401,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[To Randy.] Well, I guess it serves us right. [To the boys.] Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox."
402,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it.
403,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?"
404,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins."
405,2,10,Eric Cartman,Hooray!
406,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me."
407,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"Aww hell, I'm sorry, too."
408,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better."
409,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, I know one thing for sure."
410,2,10,Liane Cartman,"What's that, Eric?"
411,2,10,Eric Cartman,We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
412,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
413,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
