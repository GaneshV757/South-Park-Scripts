0,5,10,School Photographer,"Okay, now lift your chin a little. [no change on Stan's face] Look right here. Right here. [points at the camera lens] Hey, where's my smile? Come on, I bet you got a smile for me. I-I'm startin' to see a smile. [Stan doesn't smile] There it is. [FLASH!] Okay great, next."
1,5,10,Stan Marsh,[reaches for his hat and puts it on] I didn't smile. [hops off the stool and walks away. A wider view shows Ms. Choksondik's class in line off to the right. The kids move forward. Butters heads for the stool]
2,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
3,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[in dress shirt and tie, holds out his palms] Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. [pulls out a comb and some gel, dabs the gel on the comb, and combs his hair back. Four strokes, and he's done]"
4,5,10,School Photographer,"Okay, smile [Butters smiles, a lock of his hair goes up, and he blinks. Then the picture is taken, and Butters opens his eyes] Okay, next? [Butters hops off; Bebe, wearing heavy makeup, approaches and hops onto the stool]"
5,5,10,Stan Marsh,[joins Kyle at the end of the line] Did you go yet?
6,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,No. This is taking forever.
7,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up, giddily breathless] You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!"
8,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What, Cartman?"
9,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! [points]. Kenny, Kenny, over here! [Kenny comes in looking as Cartman described, with his hands on the floor and his feet in the air, laughing uncontrollably. After Kenny stands still, Cartman roars with laughter]"
10,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It isn't that funny, Cartman."
11,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes it is! [while this is going on, the other kids get their pictures taken, Token being the last one. He hops off the stool and walks away.]"
12,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! [Kyle walks up to the stool]"
13,5,10,Eric Cartman,"...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny."
14,5,10,School Photographer,"[Kyle sits for the camera] Take off your hat, please."
15,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,But I never take off my hat.
16,5,10,School Photographer,"Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural."
17,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,This is how I look natural.
18,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!"
19,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[angrily] Crap. [takes off his hat to reveal big red bushy hair]
20,5,10,School Photographer,"Smile! Come on, where's that smile? Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see a smile. [Kyle gives a small grin, and the picture is taken. He goes back to being angry, re-dons his hat and hops off the stool] Next!"
21,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Gay-ass. [Cartman hops on, takes off his hat and quickly strikes a pose]"
22,5,10,School Photographer,"[takes the picture] Very nice. Okay, last one? [hops off laughing as Kenny approaches]"
23,5,10,Eric Cartman,Uh oh. [laughs]
24,5,10,School Photographer,"Okay, have a seat, young man. [both Cartman and Kenny chuckle as Kenny sets himself down] Well, okay, lookin' great. Now where's that smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide smile. Wider. Perfect! [FLASH!]"
25,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?"
26,5,10,School Photographer,Should be about four days.
27,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!"
28,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!"
29,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-"
30,5,10,Eric Cartman,[bouncing in his seat] YES! YES!
31,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures [Kenny looks around], and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!"
32,5,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Aww, that's bullshit!)"
33,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! [thrusts the photo out for a close-up]"
34,5,10,Butters Stotch,Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
35,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely."
36,5,10,Butters Stotch,"But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! [the others get their photos and review them]"
37,5,10,Eric Cartman,[rushes up and takes Kenny's photos] Let me see! [returns to his seat. Stan and Kyle look at Cartman curiously while Kenny looks on angrily]
38,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[catches up to Ms. Choksondik as she sits at her chair] Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!"
39,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[opens Kenny's envelope and looks at the photo, then roars with laughter] Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!"
40,5,10,Kenny McCormick,(You've ever done?!)
41,5,10,Eric Cartman,[Laughs] Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! [laughs some more]
42,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!"
43,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!"
44,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!"
45,5,10,Eric Cartman,I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
46,5,10,Butters Stotch,I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
47,5,10,Ms Choksondik,Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. [points towards the door]
48,5,10,Butters Stotch,"My mom? [turns around and walks out] Oh, sweet Jesus!"
49,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny. [Kenny looks over] I just had the greatest idea... ever!"
50,5,10,Receptionist,Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?
51,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? [stifles a laugh]"
52,5,10,Receptionist,"Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?"
53,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes, I have it right hmya. [shows her Kenny's school photo]"
54,5,10,Receptionist,"[takes the photo] O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately."
55,5,10,Eric Cartman,"You will? [tries not to laugh, but some escapes] Ah. [stifles another laugh] Oh, ah, thank you for your help."
56,5,10,Receptionist,Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? [Cartman stops in his tracks and turns around]
57,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye. [sniggers, then laughs] Brown eye! [laughs some more under his breath]"
58,5,10,Receptionist,"Okay, brown eye..."
59,5,10,Eric Cartman,"And, and big rosy cheeks! [laughs some more]"
60,5,10,Receptionist,...Full cheeks...
61,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[cracks up] Full cheeks! [laughs] Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! [cracks up]"
62,5,10,Reporter,"Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next? [Stan and Kyle are on the sofa eating popcorn. The phone rings, and Kyle answers it]"
63,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hello?
64,5,10,Eric Cartman,[between the laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! [laughs uncontrollably]
65,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hello?
66,5,10,Eric Cartman,[more laughter] ...You guys!... [more laughter]
67,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[getting annoyed] Cartman?
68,5,10,Eric Cartman,[more laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. [hangs up]
69,5,10,Stan Marsh,What's he want?
70,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[pissed off] I don't know. Let's go see. [they walk off]
71,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Why'd you call us?
72,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Come on. Come on. [whispers] Come on.[leads the way] Oho, this is so sweet! [still laughing as he walks to the sofa and picks up a milk carton] You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!"
73,5,10,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit Cartman, what?! [Cartman hands him the carton and erupts in laughter as Stan and Kyle look it over]"
74,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
75,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! [falls to the floor, pounding the carpet with his fists in hysterics]"
76,5,10,Stan Marsh,"That isn't funny, Cartman."
77,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!"
78,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children."
79,5,10,Eric Cartman,"No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys."
80,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[gasps] Oh my God. Oh my God! [holds the carton close. Her face looks like a derriere] Steven! Steven, come quick!"
81,5,10,Steven Thompson,"[rushes in. His face does also.] What is it, Martha?"
82,5,10,Martha Thompson,Look. It's him! It's... our son.
83,5,10,Steven Thompson,Our ssson!
84,5,10,Martha Thompson,...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.
85,5,10,Receptionist,"[stunned] ... yes, I see. [pics up a milk carton carton] Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found."
86,5,10,Steven Thompson,"We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition."
87,5,10,Receptionist,...Riiight.
88,5,10,Steven Thompson,"You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be."
89,5,10,Receptionist,[flatly] ...Really?
90,5,10,Steven Thompson,Yes.
91,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Steven and I have a condition called ""torsonic polarity syndrome."" It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically."
92,5,10,Steven Thompson,Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.
93,5,10,Receptionist,"[flatly] Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing."
94,5,10,Steven Thompson,Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.
95,5,10,Receptionist,So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?
96,5,10,Steven Thompson,"No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages..."
97,5,10,Receptionist,"Well, Mr. and Mrs..."
98,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Uh, Thompssson."
99,5,10,Receptionist,"...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together."
100,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!"
101,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?"
102,5,10,Martha Thompson,You're right. You're right.
103,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?"
104,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[gets up and hops off the sofa] Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God. [tries to compose himself] Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right? [wipes some moisture from his face] And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. [cracks up again]"
105,5,10,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son."
106,5,10,Eric Cartman,"No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! [waits a second, then roars with laughter again]"
107,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,...Nuh uh.
108,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!! [roars with laughter again. The doorbell rings and all three look at the door] Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh. [walks over to answer the door. He stops and stifle a laugh] Just- okay [chuckles] No. [takes a few steps] Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. [steps to the door, takes a deep breath, and opens it, grinning]"
109,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[greeting] Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. [Cartman stands there grinning, then it disappears into a frown. A few moments later he turns around dejected.]"
110,5,10,Eric Cartman,Oh God.
111,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[starts laughing, but stifles it with his hands over his mouth] Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!"
112,5,10,Stan Marsh,"No way! [Cartman turns around and looks again, frowning]"
113,5,10,Steven Thompson,"We understand you've seen our son. [Cartman looks speechless, then turns around looking lost]"
114,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[very softly] Oh my... God. [walks away from the door quite afraid, then begins to ascend the stairs stammering nonsense]"
115,5,10,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, where are you going?? [Cartman keeps walking. The Thompsons simply shrug their shoulders, looking at each other]"
116,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[holds up the milk carton] Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?"
117,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[giggles a bit] Uh
118,5,10,Stan Marsh,Oh boy.
119,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house."
120,5,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
121,5,10,Martha Thompson,[Steven puts his arm around her shoulder] Oh thank you. Thank you! [they turn and walk away. The receptionist waits for them on the walkway]
122,5,10,Receptionist,Well?
123,5,10,Steven Thompson,They said to inquire four houses down.
124,5,10,Martha Thompson,Let's hurry! [leads the way down the street. Steven and the receptionist follow]
125,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
126,5,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you missed them turning around."
127,5,10,Eric Cartman,"You guys, something's wrong."
128,5,10,Stan Marsh,What?
129,5,10,Eric Cartman,I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
130,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[quizzically] Blew a funny fuse?
131,5,10,Eric Cartman,[turns to face them] It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded. [turns away] I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
132,5,10,Clyde,You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
133,5,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's."
134,5,10,Token Black,How do they eat?
135,5,10,Stan Marsh,How the hell should we know? [the kids stop before a house]
136,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
137,5,10,Butters Stotch,[opens his bedroom window and looks down] W-what?
138,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
139,5,10,Stan Marsh,There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
140,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture."
141,5,10,Stan Marsh,"But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!"
142,5,10,Linda Stotch,"Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!"
143,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened."
144,5,10,Linda Stotch,You made a goofy face!
145,5,10,Butters Stotch,No! That's just what I look like. See?
146,5,10,Linda Stotch,"[turns around and looks up] ...Don't you make that face at me, young man!"
147,5,10,Butters Stotch,"I'm not makin' a face, mom!"
148,5,10,Linda Stotch,Stop it!
149,5,10,Craig,"...Come on, we wanna see the ass people."
150,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Alright. [the kids turn left and walk away]
151,5,10,Linda Stotch,"Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! [goes inside and shuts the door.]"
152,5,10,Butters Stotch,Another week? [turns around and drops down] I hate my stupid face.
153,5,10,Mr Mackey,"Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?"
154,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?"
155,5,10,Mr Mackey,"Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny."
156,5,10,Eric Cartman,Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
157,5,10,Mr Mackey,"Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?"
158,5,10,Eric Cartman,"You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh."
159,5,10,Mr Mackey,"Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things."
160,5,10,Eric Cartman,[turns over to look at Mr. Mackey] So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
161,5,10,Mr Mackey,"It's possible, hm'kay? [Cartman turns over and lays on his back again] But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, ""Friends"" [laughs at the unexpected humor in his own statement]. Ohokahay, huhuh."
162,5,10,Eric Cartman,Ugh.
163,5,10,Mrs McCormick,"...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton."
164,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Yes. Yes, I see."
165,5,10,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? [Kenny just stares at them]"
166,5,10,Martha Thompson,"...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up."
167,5,10,Steven Thompson,"It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be."
168,5,10,Stuart and Mrs McCormick,Really?
169,5,10,Receptionist,"Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?"
170,5,10,Steven Thompson,Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.
171,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[leans into Steven's right shoulder, sobbing, and he comforts her] Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again. [sobs uncontrollably]"
172,5,10,Mrs McCormick,"[rises to soother her also] There there now. [looks around, then walks off]"
173,5,10,Receptionist,"Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright. [Martha continues sobbing] Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time. [Mrs. McCormick returns with a box of tissues. Martha takes one and blows her ""nose"" with it. Mr. McCormick walks off again, and Martha resumes sobbing] We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!"
174,5,10,Mrs McCormick,"[holds her arms out as if to keep Martha away] Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!"
175,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[blows her nose again and sobs some more, then tries to compose herself] Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [blows her nose]"
176,5,10,Receptionist,"Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?"
177,5,10,Steven Thompson,Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.
178,5,10,Martha Thompson,The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why. [Stan and Token are now looking in through the window. Kyle joins them. Martha blows her nose] We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own. [a couple of hands try to get a grip on the window sill]
179,5,10,Receptionist,And this was back in Wisconsin? [Craig soon rises into view outside]
180,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west. [Token, Craig, and Kyle start laughing. Tweek pops up and pushes Craig out of the way to have a good look. Stan laughs, and Craig climbs up on Tweek.] That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense."
181,5,10,Martha Thompson,"We've tried every avenue to find him, [Officer Barbrady happens by and says something. The kids jump] but, we've never tried the milk company. [Stan seems to tell Barbrady to come over and look at the ass people.]"
182,5,10,Receptionist,"Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk [Barbrady approaches] is not only the best resource for finding kids, [Barbrady's eyes widen] but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. [Barbrady walks away and calls out to some people, then returns to the window]"
183,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us. [Mr. Garrison walks by and looks in, then seems to say ""Holy crap!""]"
184,5,10,Steven Thompson,This certainly is a friendly town. [Sheila shows up behind Kyle] You've all been sssssso wonderful. [Chef shows up behind Mr. Garrison]
185,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again."
186,5,10,Stuart and wife,[they hold their palms out] NO!
187,5,10,and Receptionist,[they hold their palms out] NO!
188,5,10,Male 1,"Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties? [the audience laughs; Cartman sits there, glum, his head resting on his left hand.]"
189,5,10,Male 2,"I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash. [the audience laughs; Cartman just blinks.] Look, can we just get this over with?"
190,5,10,Male 1,"But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa! [the audience laughs]"
191,5,10,Male 2,"Come on, dude."
192,5,10,Male 1,"Oh, alright  Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa."
193,5,10,Audience,Aww
194,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[out of sorts] Oh, dude, oh."
195,5,10,Jonesy,"[noticing] Dude, what's wrong with you?"
196,5,10,Eric Cartman,Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
197,5,10,Male 1,"Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing. [Cartman fakes a laugh and the audience turns to look at him. Cartman manages a few weak laughs, then sinks in his seat]"
198,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons."
199,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Please, please. It's not your fault."
200,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room. [stops] As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible. [commercial music comes up] That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself."
201,5,10,Martha Thompson,Amazing.
202,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"[a worker comes by with some food] Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones. [the Thompsons take some milk and scones and start eating]"
203,5,10,Steven Thompson,Delicious.
204,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition. [the couple set their milks back on the tray and the worker walks out.]"
205,5,10,Steven Thompson,Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
206,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center. [leads them into a large darkened room]
207,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Oh my, isn't this impressive?"
208,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases."
209,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"[the receptionist] We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?"
210,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time."
211,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,Alright then. Computer...
212,5,10,Computer,Workiiing.
213,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.
214,5,10,Computer,TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.
215,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?
216,5,10,Martha Thompson,That's right.
217,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?"
218,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo, [takes a bite out of the scone and chews it] we assumed someone had seen him since we did."
219,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[pulls out a baby picture] This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy. [in diapers in a crib, looking like he's just finished eating]"
220,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.
221,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili. [walks out. The Thompsons follow him]"
222,5,10,Steven Thompson,We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.
223,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much."
224,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! [goes inside, and Jimmy follows, closing the door]"
225,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,What's this all about?
226,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor."
227,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much."
228,5,10,Eric Cartman,I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
229,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine."
230,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let me have it."
231,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
232,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay, why?"
233,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. [Cartman doesn't respond]"
234,5,10,Eric Cartman,"...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing."
235,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock."

237,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,Orange.

245,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,[interrupting] Moooooo! [...no response.] ...What a terrific audience. [the two of them stand in the middle of the living room looking at each other]
246,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?"
247,5,10,Computer,Workiiing.
248,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity."
249,5,10,Computer,Workiiing. [some computer noises] Negative.
250,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?"

255,5,10,Computer,Workiiing. [some computer noises] Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits.
256,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk."
257,5,10,Computer,"In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks."
258,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S."
259,5,10,Computer,"Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match"
260,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,Bingo. Do you have a photo
261,5,10,Computer,"Printiiing. [the screen reads ""Processing"". A picture starts appearing on screen]"
262,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,My God. Oh my God!
263,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! Hey Butters!
264,5,10,Butters Stotch,[opens his windows; has a paper bag over his head] Hehyeah?
265,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!"
266,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems."
267,5,10,Stan Marsh,Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
268,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to [raises his hand high] here with me."
269,5,10,Stephen Stotch,Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?
270,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[hops down to the floor] I sure am, Dad!"
271,5,10,Stephen Stotch,"Alright, you can take the paper bag off."
272,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[removes the bag] Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-"

280,5,10,Clyde,"Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. [turns with the other boys and follows Kyle off. Butters slams his windows shut]"
281,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school."
282,5,10,Eric Cartman,And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
