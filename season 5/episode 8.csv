0,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,HA! I killed you!
1,5,8,Stan Marsh,"HA, I blew your head off!"
2,5,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Aw, Goddamnit!)"
3,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?"
4,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?"
5,5,8,Eric Cartman,Let a man take a crap!
6,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet."
7,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing"
8,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!"
9,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[from behind the bathroom door] I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? [finishes wiping his butt and zips himself up. He comes out of the bathroom with something in his hands] You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper."
10,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?"
11,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody."
12,5,8,Sharon Marsh,[walks in with a basket of laundry] Are you guys still playing that video game?
13,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom."
14,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[holds it up] Look. [Sharon gasps and drops the laundry. Cartman unravels it] But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. [looks through it]"
15,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Eric, put that down!"
16,5,8,Eric Cartman,Why?
17,5,8,Sharon Marsh,Just go put it back in the trashcan!
18,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[inspects it] Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive."
19,5,8,Sharon Marsh,No that... that came from me; just put it away.
20,5,8,Eric Cartman,This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! [hick accent] You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
21,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[looks up at his mom] What is it, Mom?"
22,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?"
23,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing. [game play stops and the boys look at her] I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting."
24,5,8,Stan Marsh,The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
25,5,8,Sharon Marsh,Sure.
26,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cool!
27,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!"
28,5,8,Stan Marsh,"There it is. The Okama GameSphere. [the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console]"
29,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM."
30,5,8,Stan Marsh,What's that?
31,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't know, but it kicks ass. [they watch as Sharon buys the console from Mr. Harris and he wraps it up and delivers it to her] Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park."
32,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. [the boys turn away from the window]"
33,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. [checks his watch.] It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!"
34,5,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
35,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Awesome! [suddenly remembers] Oh, crap."
36,5,8,Stan Marsh,What?
37,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
38,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we got GameSphere."
39,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. [a strange character walks up next to them]"
40,5,8,Towelie,"Don't forget to bring a towel. [it's a walking, talking towel]"
41,5,8,Stan Marsh,What?
42,5,8,Towelie,"When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, ""Don't forget to bring a towel."""
43,5,8,Stan Marsh,...O-kay.
44,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks, Towelie."
45,5,8,Towelie,[after a few moments of silence] Do you wanna get high?
46,5,8,Stan Marsh,"No. [Towelie looks for a few moments, then walks away]"
47,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games."
48,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere."
49,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Here you go, boys. [Stan takes the shopping box and the boys take off]"
50,5,8,Boys,AAAAAA.
51,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, turn it on."
52,5,8,TV,"""Okama GameSphere""!"
53,5,8,Boys,Whoa!
54,5,8,TV,[the game title comes up] Thirst For BLOOD!
55,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it."
56,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, this is so cool."
57,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Bring it, bring it! [on the TV two monsters fight each other. The one on the right attacks the other with a chainsaw. ""Oh!""]"
58,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late."
59,5,8,Stan Marsh,"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere."
60,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[slowly slides into a hick accent] Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih."
61,5,8,Randy Marsh,What?
62,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Nothing. Come on, Randy. [whisks him off to bed. From the TV: ""Twenty kills.""]"
63,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- [to Cartman] wha-what is it?"
64,5,8,Eric Cartman,Date-rape psychosis.
65,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. [hangs up] I don't have to go outside!"
66,5,8,Eric Cartman,Awesome!
67,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight.."
68,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!"
69,5,8,Eric Cartman,We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
70,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, it's alright. We can still play for [looks at his watch] six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball."
71,5,8,Towelie,[walks in from nowhere] Don't forget to bring a towel.
72,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Uh no.
73,5,8,Towelie,"When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, ""Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."""
74,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Okay, we will."
75,5,8,Towelie,"[raises its arms in victory] Alright! [lowers them, then after some moments] Do you wanna get high?"
76,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,No we don't wanna get high!
77,5,8,Towelie,Okay... You sure?
78,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! [Towelie goes away]"
79,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!"
80,5,8,Eric Cartman,That's... so... cool!
81,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now."
82,5,8,Stan Marsh,"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer."
83,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school."
84,5,8,Eric Cartman,It's Monday?
85,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh, I'm sick."
86,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
87,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"No, you're not sick. Now get to school. [disconnects the console from the TV] All of you."
88,5,8,Stan Marsh,But Mom...
89,5,8,Sharon Marsh,Go!
90,5,8,Boys,Aagh!
91,5,8,Stan Marsh,Can't believe we have to go to school!
92,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid."
93,5,8,Stan Marsh,We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. [a green car pulls up in front of them. Two soldiers are in it]
94,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Hello, boys, how are you?"
95,5,8,Stan Marsh,Fine.
96,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere."
97,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,What? You mean Towelie? [the two soldier look alarmed. The passenger quickly gets on the radio]
98,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at... [checks his map] Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado! [the men look at the boys]"
99,5,8,Eric Cartman,"What, dude? [the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.]"
100,5,8,Stan Marsh,This is gonna be one looong-ass day. [Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.]
101,5,8,Stan Marsh,That was the longest day of school ever!
102,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! [the boys burst in and head for the television]"
103,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Where is it?
104,5,8,Stan Marsh,It... it was right here.
105,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Where the hell is it??
106,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Come on, man, this isn't funny! [Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman look around and behind the TV] I need my fix! [the phone rings, and Stan goes to answer it.]"
107,5,8,Stan Marsh,Hello?
108,5,8,Voice,"If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel. [the boys gather to wait for Stan]"
109,5,8,Stan Marsh,What? Who-who is this?
110,5,8,Voice,"Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else! [in the background: ""Okama GameSphere!""]"
111,5,8,Stan Marsh,Don't hurt it! [Click. Stan then hangs up]
112,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,What? [Stan turns around]
113,5,8,Stan Marsh,They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
114,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[in disbelief, backs up.] No! ...No!"
115,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!"
116,5,8,Stan Marsh,Towelie!
117,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, towel!"
118,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Where the hell is he?
119,5,8,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know. Where could it be?)
120,5,8,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him."
121,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
122,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. [the others stop, and he calls out in one direction] Gebaayybeh! [then in another] Gebaayybeh!"
123,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,That's a towel call?
124,5,8,Stan Marsh,This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
125,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water."
126,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey yeah. [goes into the street and clears his throat] Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! [looks around. So do the others] Aaah. Let's go take a shower! [all look around] Let's go waterskiing!"
127,5,8,Towelie,[walks up] Don't forget to bring a towel.
128,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,There he is!
129,5,8,Towelie,"Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. [Stan walks over angrily and takes Towelie's left hand, and pulls him along]."
130,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude! [the others follow]"
131,5,8,Towelie,Where are we goin'?
132,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Just come on! It's getting dark.
133,5,8,Towelie,Are we gonna get high?
134,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Are you sure this is where they said to be?
135,5,8,Stan Marsh,They said the gas station outside of town.
136,5,8,Towelie,"Well, I'm gonna get a little high. [A high-powered light comes on]"
137,5,8,Man,Hold it! [ten men stand in the light. Some of them wear red berets]
138,5,8,Stan Marsh,Who is that? [squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same]
139,5,8,Man,"Step... away... from the towel! [the boys do so, and an official steps forth]"
140,5,8,Official,"There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you."
141,5,8,Towelie,"If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel."
142,5,8,Official,"It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you."
143,5,8,Stan Marsh,"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games."
144,5,8,Official,Your what?
145,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!"
146,5,8,Official,I don't know what you're talking about.
147,5,8,Stan Marsh,You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
148,5,8,Official,"Omigod! [shrieks] IT""S A TRAP!! [gunfire strikes him and kills him. Behind the boys soldiers pop up in the hills and continue firing]"
149,5,8,Man 2,"Cover! Cover! [the officials and their personal security force fire back, and the light is knocked out]"
150,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit, what now?!"
151,5,8,Official,"Run, towel! [a grenade lands between two guards and blows up, shredding them to bits. The boys just look on]"
152,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[disinterested] Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. [leads the others away]"
153,5,8,Soldier 1,Where's the towel?!
154,5,8,Soldier 2,"It can't be far! [two more soldiers come up, and others move along behind them] Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!"
155,5,8,Guard,[coughs up blood. The boys arrive] Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
156,5,8,Stan Marsh,[grabs the guard by the lapels and throttles him] Where is our Okama GameSphere?
157,5,8,Guard,"Get the towel home [cough] They will explain everything. Please, hurry! [coughs up blood once more, and dies]"
158,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, God-damnit!"
159,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?"
160,5,8,Towelie,"What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away."
161,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. [they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements]"
162,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Well?
163,5,8,Soldier,"They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air."
164,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. [gets pensive] They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
165,5,8,Soldier 2,"Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T. [the commander looks at him annoyed, and he leaves]"
166,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B."
167,5,8,Soldier 3,You mean...?
168,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Yes. [camera zooms in] Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. [fade to black]
169,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Are we getting close?
170,5,8,Towelie,I think so.
171,5,8,Stan Marsh,"A little more gas, Kenny. [Kenny presses down on the gas pedal]"
172,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,How long has it been since you've been back there.
173,5,8,Towelie,"I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important."
174,5,8,Eric Cartman,No it isn't.
175,5,8,Towelie,Is!
176,5,8,Eric Cartman,No it isn't.
177,5,8,Towelie,"Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road."
178,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Brake, Kenny, brake. [Kenny brakes, and Stan steers the truck to the right to go down the dirt road. Towelie moves to the window]"
179,5,8,Eric Cartman,Egh!
180,5,8,Towelie,M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
181,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[sighs] Dude, don't you remember where it is?"
182,5,8,Towelie,"I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high. [pulls out a joint...] then I'll remember where it is. [lights the joint and puffs deeply. The boys watch him as his eyes get bloodshot.]"
183,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, so where is it?"
184,5,8,Towelie,Where's what?
185,5,8,Boys,Agh!
186,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! [Towelie simply snorts]
187,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! [Kenny brakes angrily and the truck jerks to a stop] Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!"
188,5,8,Towelie,Well calm down.
189,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,That's it! [takes the joint] You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
190,5,8,Towelie,"That's my last joint, asshole!"
191,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
192,5,8,Towelie,"Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit."
193,5,8,A Woman,"Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil. [some strange sounds are heard outside the door] Kevin, is that you?"
194,5,8,Soldier,Harris! Reach bang and clear!
195,5,8,A Woman,"Hello? [the bathroom door flies open and five soldiers pour in, firing away] WAAH! [she falls to the ground quick] Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod! [she covers her head]"
196,5,8,Soldier,"Alright, it's clear! It's clear! [the soldiers leave the restroom. The woman gets up and checks herself for bullet wounds and finds none. She turns to see the wall behind her. The towels on their rack are shot through with holes. She blinks, confused]"
197,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! [Mrs. Tweak leans out of the way, watching her towels get shot up.]"
198,5,8,Soldier,Let's go let's go! [The soldiers finish their job and walk away. Mrs. Tweak straightens up]
199,5,8,Soldier,Get it!
200,5,8,Mr Garrison,What the? [two soldiers rush over and make him face the lockers. One of them pulls off his towel]
201,5,8,Soldier,Throw it down! [the soldier throws it down]
202,5,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! [the soldier stabs at the towel twice, then directs another soldier to fire away at it. The other soldier shoots at it while the other two watch]"
203,5,8,Soldier,"Alright, let's go! [the soldiers leave]"
204,5,8,Mr Garrison,Huh where are you goin'?
205,5,8,Eric Cartman,This is where you came from?
206,5,8,Towelie,"Yeah, I think so. [gets woozy] Oh man."
207,5,8,Stan Marsh,What?
208,5,8,Towelie,I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. [the group goes around the fountain and goes inside]
209,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400."
210,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?"
211,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
212,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth"
213,5,8,Stan Marsh,We don't care.
214,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly."
215,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we don't care."
216,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off."
217,5,8,Stan Marsh,We... don't... care.
218,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?"
219,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop."
220,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Who's they?
221,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction."
222,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[dismissive] Don't care, don't care, don't care."
223,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again."
224,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!"
225,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at ""their"" base."
226,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?"
227,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),You mean to go right into their base? [thinks] Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.
228,5,8,Soldier,"Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!"
229,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Ah yes. [salutes back, and all three men lower their arms] Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?"
230,5,8,Sgt Masters,Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
231,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this. [the two sergeants look at each other]
232,5,8,Sgt Boll,"Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles."
233,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Hmm... [taps his pointer on the strategic map] So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!"
234,5,8,Sgt Masters,Oo we...
235,5,8,Sgt Boll,"He must have outsmarted us, sir."
236,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
237,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
238,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
239,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"[rolls up to Towelie] I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks."
240,5,8,Towelie,That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
241,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you."
242,5,8,Stan Marsh,"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?"
243,5,8,Guard,"Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?"
244,5,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah. [the boys join Towelie and all go to jump from the helicopter]
245,5,8,Guard,"Go go go go! [one after the other, the four boys and Towelie jump off, and then the helicopter leaves. Stan is the first to pull his parachute string, and the others follow. Soon they're all next to each other, floating down. Stan sighs]"
246,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I figured it out."
247,5,8,Stan Marsh,What?
248,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!"
249,5,8,Stan Marsh,"So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?"
250,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Seven and a half.
251,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[getting impatient] Hurry up, stupid parachute!"
252,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I think we go over there. [the Secret Government Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching the gate]"
253,5,8,Towelie,"[at the security entry pad] Let's see. [types in some numbers] No. [touches his lips with his right index finger, trying to figure out what to type next]"
254,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks."
255,5,8,Towelie,Hey it's been a long time!
256,5,8,Eric Cartman,You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
257,5,8,Towelie,"[faces Cartman] Don't preach to me, fatso!"
258,5,8,Eric Cartman,"I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!"
259,5,8,Towelie,You're stupid!
260,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and you're a towel!"
261,5,8,Towelie,"You're a towel! [Cartman has nothing more to say, and Towelie hops off the box towards the boys] Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high."
262,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! [gives Towelie the joint] Here's your stupid lighter. [tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.]"
263,5,8,Towelie,Hold on. [hops on the box and types into the entry pad again.] Wait a second [presses a few buttons] That's it!
264,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,That's it?
265,5,8,Towelie,"Yeah. That's the melody to ""Funky Town."" [starts playing the melody on the keypad] Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town."
266,5,8,Stan Marsh,"No, Towelie, the entry code!"
267,5,8,Towelie,[turns around] For what?
268,5,8,Stan Marsh,"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence."
269,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Well let's look in here. [opens the door and leads the others in. Before them are cylinders of liquids, each with a floating deformed clone of Towelie in it. They come across a Towelie clone drying under a heat lamp]"
270,5,8,Towelie Clone,Kill... me... Kill... me.
271,5,8,Towelie,Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
272,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"[enters with four soldiers, who quickly get set to fire] Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in."
273,5,8,Towelie,[turns around with the boys] What are these things?
274,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid."
275,5,8,Towelie Clone,Kill... me.
276,5,8,Stan Marsh,Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
277,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story."
278,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh God, don't care, don't care."
279,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"[pacing proudly, solemnly] Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. [the boys show no interest.]"
280,5,8,Soldier,Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
281,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,What terrifying secret?
282,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
283,5,8,Eric Cartman,"We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?"
284,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. [his voice begins to deepen] Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know."
285,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,And we don't care.
286,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down."
287,5,8,Stan Marsh,So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
288,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Oh yes. It has been all along.
289,5,8,Soldier,"Can I kill the towel now, sir?"
290,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Go ahead. [the boys move away quickly]
291,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"No, wait. [stays the weapon] Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. [zoom in on a tiny camera close to Towelie's lower border. Officials back at Tynacorp's command center are looking at the live feed] You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all."
292,5,8,Stan Marsh,But we don't care!
293,5,8,Official 1,What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
294,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
295,5,8,Official 2,We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
296,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. [presses a button. A door with ""GS-401"" on it slowly spins around. A towel rack appears and a mean-looking buff towel hangs from it]"
297,5,8,GS 4 1,[deep voice] Don't forget to bring a towel!
298,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. [hands a disk to Stan] Then upload this encryption disk into their computers."
299,5,8,Stan Marsh,We're just going in to get our video game back.
300,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. [hands it to Kyle]"
301,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Photon rifle, whatever. [the boys enter Tynacorp with Towelie.]"
302,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Hello? Hello, anybody here? [GS-401 hops down from the rafters]"
303,5,8,GS 4 1,"Welcome to the party, boys! [flexes and rushes Towelie] HAAARRRHHHH!! [the two towels wrestle a bit]"
304,5,8,Towelie,Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
305,5,8,GS 4 1,HAAARRRHHHH!! [Kyle fires the photon rifle and knocks the beefier towel away with the beam. The research team and security force pour into the room angrily]
306,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?"
307,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"[he and his troops pour in another door] Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! [the two forces face each other, with the boys and Towelie in the middle] Don't make a move, you bastards!"
308,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children."
309,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
310,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!"
311,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Ohmigod, look! [in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it]"
312,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Our GameSphere! [the boys each get a controller and activate the GameSphere: ""Okama GameSphere""]"
313,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. [behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play]"
314,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"[turns to look at the boys] You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!"
315,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!"
316,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level."
317,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Sweet!
318,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,[now facing the research leader] But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar! [pulls at the research leader's head and the face comes off. Under it a green fish-alien head appears]
319,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!"
320,5,8,Zytar,Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
321,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"[looks at the boys] And now you know the horrible truth, boys."
322,5,8,Zytar,"Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! [fires a gun at the commander. Both sides begin to fire at each other and there are casualties on both sides. Zytar and two guards slowly back away and out of view]"
323,5,8,Eric Cartman,Could you turn it up?
324,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out! [the boys continue playing their game, so the commander comes up and reaches for the encryption disk in Stan's pocket, then goes away. Towelie sits on the floor with a huge bong, getting high. The commander reappears across the room moving towards a red button] I think I can get it from here, boys!"
325,5,8,Zytar,[returns] What are you doing? You'll kill us all!
326,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings. [inserts the disk and a huge explosion blows the boys out of the room.]"
327,5,8,Boys,"Oooww! [Then it blows out the roof and some sides of the main building, and the boys find themselves hanging from Towelie, above a boiling tank of acid]"
328,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Hup hup. Come on, hang on. [Stan and Kyle moan]"
329,5,8,Stan Marsh,Whoa.
330,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa.
331,5,8,Kenny McCormick,(Help help! Heeelllppp!) [loses his grip on Kyle]
332,5,8,Eric Cartman,Kenny!
333,5,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Nooo!) [falls into the acid tank, disintegrating and sinking. Kyle looks on, but next to him is the GameSphere]"
334,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[sees it] Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! [above him, Stan watches large pieces of metal fall to the ground]"
335,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! [Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere]"
336,5,8,GS 4 1,[walks in on an adjacent catwalk and sees Towelie with the boys hanging] What are you doing?
337,5,8,Towelie,"Get away from me, you evil towel!"
338,5,8,GS 4 1,"Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them."
339,5,8,Towelie,No way! They're my friends!
340,5,8,GS 4 1,"They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now."
341,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,[swings closer] I've almost got it!
342,5,8,GS 4 1,"You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. [holds out a joint. Towelie looks at it longingly] Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!"
343,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[feels Towelie slip] Aw, crap!"
344,5,8,GS 4 1,"You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high."
345,5,8,Towelie,You asshole.
346,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!"
347,5,8,GS 4 1,"Come, Towelie! Make your decision!"
348,5,8,Towelie,"I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! [Stan is shocked at the answer. Towelie stretches enough to take a puff while holding on to the boys, then slips enough for Kyle to succeed]"
349,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,I got it! [grabs the GameSphere. Towelie pulls himself and the boys up to the catwalk in front of a door. An explosion behind GS-401 sends it into the air]
350,5,8,GS 4 1,Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [floats down into the acid and disintegrates]
351,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!"
352,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Alright!
353,5,8,Towelie,Alright!
354,5,8,Eric Cartman,Hooray!
355,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude, we finished level 50!"
356,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Awesome!
357,5,8,Towelie,"Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on."
358,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
359,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level."
360,5,8,Towelie,[heavily slurred] Don't forget to bring a towel. [the boys laugh]
361,5,8,Eric Cartman,"You're the worst character ever, Towelie."
362,5,8,Towelie,I know.
