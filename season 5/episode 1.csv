0,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,[joining the two other boys] Hey you guys! Look what I have!
1,5,1,Stan Marsh,What?
2,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
3,5,1,Stan and Kenny,[pause] ...Oh.
4,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool."
5,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool."
6,5,1,Eric Cartman,"[off-screen, but rushes in] You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!"
7,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"What, doughboy?"
8,5,1,Eric Cartman,"I was just- [looks stung, then flashes an angry look at Kyle] I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial."
9,5,1,Stan Marsh,So?
10,5,1,Eric Cartman,"So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama."
11,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?
12,5,1,Eric Cartman,"No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television."
13,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
14,5,1,Eric Cartman,You'll never guess.
15,5,1,Stan Marsh,What?!
16,5,1,Eric Cartman,Guess.
17,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?"
18,5,1,Eric Cartman,"You ready? [focus on Cartman] Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say, [looks both ways] ""Shit."""
19,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[gasps] They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?"
20,5,1,Stan Marsh,"They can't say ""shit"" on television!"
21,5,1,Eric Cartman,"It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude."
22,5,1,Stan Marsh,Holy fucking shit!
23,5,1,Kenny McCormick,(Dude! We've gotta watch!)
24,5,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
25,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
26,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!"
27,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
28,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come, on dude! This is history."
29,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,It's stupid!
30,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?"
31,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!"
32,5,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?"
33,5,1,Sam,"Yeah, they're gonna say ""shit"" on television."
34,5,1,Colleague 1,"[balding man] Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar."
35,5,1,Colleague 2,[with light brown hair] Yeaaahhh!
36,5,1,Sam,Yeah.
37,5,1,Randy Marsh,Yeah.
38,5,1,Colleague 2,Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
39,5,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show."
40,5,1,Sam,"And they're gonna say ""shit""!"
41,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Butters! [Butters turns to see Kyle, and the tag is shown: ""Butters""] I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite [points] YOU before anybody else."
42,5,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, sorry, I can't. [Kyle is disappointed] They're gonna say ""shit"" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way."
43,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
44,5,1,Mr Garrison,"[walks by] Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes! [people get in their cars and peel out of there, while those on the sidewalks quickly disperse. Only Kyle is left, bewildered]"
45,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","[voice-over] Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse me!"
46,5,1,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes."
47,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!"
48,5,1,Jimbo,"Oh, was that it? Was that it?!"
49,5,1,Randy Marsh,"[annoyed] Shipped. He said ""shipped""."
50,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -"
51,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",- your job is to protect the men who serve this force.
52,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!"
53,5,1,Stan Marsh,Sh!
54,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
55,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!
56,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!"
57,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.
58,5,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?"
59,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","That's it, I've had enough of this."
60,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","Don't you turn your back on me, you!"
61,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","I said, enough!"
62,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Is it?
63,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Will it... ever be enough?
64,5,1,Announcer,Cop Drama will return after these messages.
65,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?"""
66,5,1,Eric Cartman,I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
67,5,1,Stan and Kyle,Uh! [Kyle drops from the sofa and heads away]
68,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Where are you going, Kyle?"
69,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,[stops and looks back] I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
70,5,1,Stan Marsh,"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!"
71,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,I don't really give a fuck! [turns and walks away]
72,5,1,Stan Marsh,Oh.
73,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
74,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what."
75,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
76,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell? [voice lowers to a whisper] You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there."
77,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks."
78,5,1,Bar Patrons,Wow!!!
79,5,1,The Boys,Whoa!!!
80,5,1,Chef and Principal Victoria,Oh!!
81,5,1,Old Folks,Whoa!
82,5,1,Jimbo,[awed] They did it!
83,5,1,Stan Marsh,I can't believe they actually said it. [Kyle returns with some food]
84,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!"
85,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
86,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?"
87,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?! [moves from one end of the sofa to the other] Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world? [moves towards the front door] It's still the same old world out there. Look. [opens the door to find frogs raining down on the neighborhood. The other boys soon join him] What the hell?"
88,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs."
89,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, whatever. [steps back inside]"
90,5,1,Anchor Tom,"Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama [title screen pops up], broke new ground by saying ""Shit!"" on television, making ""shit"" officially okay to say around the country. [poll picture pops up, and is filled in as the announcer continues] A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit. [A Medical Alert pops up] In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community. [a field reporter stands before an ambulance and a barn] Rick Watts has the story."
91,5,1,Rick Watts and Anchorman Tom,"Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town- [begins to vomit strenuously, then falls over dead]"
92,5,1,Rick Watts and Anchorman Tom,"Whoa, shit!"
93,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, ""shit""."
94,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?!"
95,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
96,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form."
97,5,1,Eric Cartman,[quizzically] Huh?
98,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance, [turns and writes on the board] ""That's a shitty picture of me."" is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of [writes] ""This is a picture of shit."" is still naughty. [crosses out the sentence]"
99,5,1,Eric Cartman,I don't get it.
100,5,1,Stan Marsh,Me neither.
101,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example: [writes] ""The weather outside is shitty."" However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example: [writes] ""My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty."" [crosses it out] That's right out!"
102,5,1,Timmy Burch,Sss...sss...[draws it out] shit. [grins]
103,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"Very good, Timmy."
104,5,1,Butters Stotch,"[raises his hand] Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, ""Oh, shit,"" or, ""shit on a shingle""?"
105,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"Yes, that's now fine."
106,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!"
107,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[angrily] It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!"
108,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina."
109,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,There's no sand in my vagina!!!
110,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"[pointing] Boys, watch your language! Shit!"
111,5,1,Mr Garrison,"And so, children, instead of saying ""Hand in your papers,"" I may now say, ""Hand in your shit."" Any questions?"
112,5,1,Filmore,"What about, ""I have to take a shit""?"
113,5,1,Mr Garrison,"No! No, Filmore! You can say ""I have to poop and shit,"" or ""Oh, shit, I have to poop,"" but not ""I have to shit."" Are we all clear?"
114,5,1,Kindergartners,No.
