1,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon? [chuckles]"
2,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[puts her hands on her hips] Oh, you!"
3,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Just kidding. [lowers the newspaper and takes the gift from Butters and shakes it] Oh, I wonder what it is."
4,5,14,Butters Stotch,"It's a- [covers his mouth for a second, then looks down] Awww, shucks, [looks at his dad] I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty."
5,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!"
6,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it?? [starts running around the coffee table in excitement] Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! [stops and bounces with excitement]"
7,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days."
8,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!"
9,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir","Who's the boy that can laugh at a storm cloud?
Turn a frown into a smile for free?
Who's the kid with a heart full of magic?
Everyone knows it's Butters!"
10,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me.

Who thinks being yourself is the best thing to be?
Who's that rascal with the tweezers in his pocket?
Everyone knows it's Butters!"
12,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[In the splash screen, claps his fists together in the hole] That's me."
13,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir","Jumpin' in puddles, skippin' down the hallway
Pettin' at the petting zoo. He loves John Alway.
[Butters, with pic of himself and John Elway, corrects the choir: ""Elway!""]
Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples,
Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?
If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find
A little boy named Butters!"
14,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[In the splash screen, the hole he was in is gone] Thaat's that's me, [brings his fists together twice.] Yeah. [walks off to his left]."
15,5,14,Butters Stotch,[making calculations on a sheet of paper at the coffee table] Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
16,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[rises and walks over to Mom] Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. [hugs her gently]Linda: I hope he means me, haha. [Dad turns and walks to the door.]Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you."
17,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[at the front door] I'll be back in a little bit. [Butters rises to see him off] Butters, you're in charge of the house."
18,5,14,Butters Stotch,[salutes] Yes sir! [Dad exits and closes the door. Butters moves back to the table.]
19,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[walking towards the door] Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?"
20,5,14,Butters Stotch,We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
21,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[walks around Butters to the other end of the coffee table] Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short. [walks away towards the camera and stops, wondering] I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to."
22,5,14,Butters Stotch,Dad's a good shopper all right.
23,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[kneels beside Butters] Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me."
24,5,14,Butters Stotch,"You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?"
25,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[rises and goes to the computer] No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? [takes a badge from the desk and shows it to Butters.]"
26,5,14,Butters Stotch,Sure I do!
27,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing. [hands the badge to Butters, who puts it on] What do you say?"
28,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[salutes her] Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! [walks away]"
29,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",Everyone know it's Butters!
30,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] Uh, that's me!"

34,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] Uh, that's me!"
35,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I'm back, Ma!"
36,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?"
37,5,14,Butters Stotch,I sure did. [walks over to the breakfast table and takes a seat] Dad sure had a nice night out.
38,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?"
39,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well first, he went to see a movie."
40,5,14,Linda Stotch,A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
41,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat. [Mom freezes] I didn't know it was open. [a look of dread is on her face]"
42,5,14,Linda Stotch,Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
43,5,14,Butters Stotch,"""Fisting Firemen 9"" [her dread turns to shock] I've never seen 1 through 8."
44,5,14,Linda Stotch,Oh my God...
45,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him."
46,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?"
47,5,14,Butters Stotch,To the gym.
48,5,14,Linda Stotch,To the gym?
49,5,14,Butters Stotch,Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
50,5,14,Linda Stotch,[stung by that revelation] Gaah!
51,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!"
52,5,14,Linda Stotch,[really shocked] ...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
53,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures. [holds them up for his mom to see. She walks over and takes them from him. She sees her husband gong into the theater, then into the spa, then being rammed by a man from behind...] The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'. [his mom faints right to the floor] Oh, did you have a nice ""trip,"" Mom? See you next ""fall."" Hahaha, yo- Ma?"
54,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",...Butters!
55,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] Uh, that's me!"
56,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[in a fractured, disturbed voice] Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint."
57,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times."
58,5,14,Linda Stotch,Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!
59,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[approaches Butters] Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?"
60,5,14,Butters Stotch,Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
61,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. [walks towards the front door.]"
62,5,14,Linda Stotch,[paints furiously now] Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.
63,5,14,Chris Stotch,[opens the door] I'll be back in a little while. [exits]
64,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[walks over to the door] Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?"
65,5,14,Linda Stotch,"I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again. [rolls some paint on him downwards] Paaiint. [rolls some paint on him upwards] Paaiint. [turns around and walks away, leaving a confused Butters behind] Must be made clean. New."
66,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. [opens the door and exits.]"
67,5,14,Linda Stotch,[alone with her thoughts in front of a family photo] Must clean Butters. [paints over her face] Clean. Never be clean. Must... [paints over Butters' face] kill? The only way? Must kill Butters. [paints some more over their faces] Paaiint.
68,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",...Butters!
69,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
70,5,14,Butters Stotch,One please.
71,5,14,White Swallow Spa Attendant,Locker two thirteen! [a towel pops out through a dispenser next to the window]
72,5,14,Butters Stotch,Uh thanks! [takes the towel and heads for the spa's locker room.]
73,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[appears in the doorway] Dad? [walks in] Dad, you in here?"
74,5,14,Butters Stotch,Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
75,5,14,Man,"[voice only] There, do you think that works?"
76,5,14,Mr Garrison,"[voice only] Well, that's four fingers; try five."
77,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, Mr. Garrison?"
78,5,14,Mr Garrison,...Who is that?!
79,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[reaches the second door to his left, which is ajar] Da-ad? Da-ad?? [pushes the door open] Are you wrestlin' in here? [gets a better look: two men are engaged in anal intercourse] Dad?"
80,5,14,Mr Slave,This room's taken.
81,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs. [exits and closes that door, then moves to the opposite room and looks in] Dad? No. [leaves that room and moves to the third door to his right] Hm. [opens the door: his father is masturbating, but Butters doesn't know what that is.]"
82,5,14,Chris Stotch,[sees his son at the door and quickly covers himself] OOH! BUTTERS!
83,5,14,Butters Stotch,Hi Dad! [waves and smiles]
84,5,14,Chris Stotch,[now with towel in hand] Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!
85,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?"
86,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[quite embarrassed, has the towel in position] Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you."
87,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. [backs out and closes the door]"
88,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[now distraught] Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?"
89,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",Everyone knows it's Butters!
90,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
91,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[closes a book, rises and calls out] Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?"
92,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[appears in the doorway] Uh, hey Dad."
93,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Come here, son. [taps his lap. Butters enters and approaches] I wanna have a talk with you."
94,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[hops onto his father's lap] Well, sure thing, Dad."
95,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying."
96,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so."
97,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Yes, it sure can be. [pause] But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called ""little white lies."""
98,5,14,Butters Stotch,Little white lies?
99,5,14,Chris Stotch,"You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house."
100,5,14,Butters Stotch,"...Uh, who's Jack?"
101,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane."
102,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh no, that won't happen, Dad."
103,5,14,Chris Stotch,"It won't? Oh, good."
104,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine."
105,5,14,Chris Stotch,You... what?
106,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[In the doorway] Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now."
107,5,14,Butters Stotch,"A drive? Oh, boy! [puts his fists together twice] I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?"
108,5,14,Linda Stotch,"No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think."
109,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[hops off his dad's lap] Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad. [walks out after his mother] Oh boy, a drive!"
110,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along."
111,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[with a blank expression on her face] Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?"
112,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too."
113,5,14,Linda Stotch,"And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best."
114,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself."
115,5,14,Linda Stotch,"If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert."
116,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere? [begins searching] It's cold out here."
117,5,14,Linda Stotch,"I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters. [Butters looks up at her] I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened."
118,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then. [she moves the gear shift to neutral, releases the emergency brake, opens the driver-side door, and exits. She walks away from the water, and the car starts to move forward] You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom. [cut to a view of the water from the dock] Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water."
119,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[close up. Her hands are together, fingertips touching] Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon."
120,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[a view of the dock from the water] Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water! [she turns away as the car leaves the dock] Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! [she walks away]"
121,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",Everyone knows it's Butters!
122,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
123,5,14,Linda Stotch,"""Dear bastard husband,"" No. [scribbles over the words, then writes] ""Dear lying sonofabitch,"" No. [scribbles over the words, then writes] ""Dear assface,"" Yeah, that's it. ""I will no longer-"""
124,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[enters the front door and quickly grasps the situation] Linda?? What are you doing?? [moves behind the sofa and to the lamp. Linda rises and quickly moves to the noose, then puts it on defiantly]"
125,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Stay away from me, bastard!"
126,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Linda, I know this is very hard-"
127,5,14,Linda Stotch,[snaps back] You don't know anything!
128,5,14,Chris Stotch,"I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!"
129,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[sobbing] Then why, Chris, why?!"
130,5,14,Chris Stotch,"It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!"
131,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Well, [glares at him] you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! [turns away and sobs]"
132,5,14,Chris Stotch,"No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you. [she removes the noose and falls to the floor] We can have a normal life!"
133,5,14,Linda Stotch,"There is no going back, Chris!"
134,5,14,Chris Stotch,Sure there is!
135,5,14,Linda Stotch,No! [turns to face him] Our son is dead!
136,5,14,Chris Stotch,What?
137,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[sobbing] I killed him. [collects her thoughts] I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!"
138,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Oh no. [Linda cries loudly] No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?"
139,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[snaps] I WASN'T THINKING! [catches her breath] I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you! [points at him, then breaks down] Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- [dissolves into sobs]"
140,5,14,Chris Stotch,[confused] This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.
141,5,14,Linda Stotch,Just go away and let me die! [sobs]
142,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[genuflects next to her] No! Linda, we-"
143,5,14,Linda Stotch,"I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! [lays down on the floor face first and pounds it with her right fist]"
144,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Linda, Butters is gone. [drops into thought] Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! [she start weeping, then he starts, and they both weep...]"
145,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now. [the car floats down some more and crashes into some boulders. The passenger-side door flies open] Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt. [unfastens it and lets it go. He scrambles out and over the boulders] Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home. [before him are some low hills and the Rockies in the background. No buildings in sight] Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?"
146,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
147,5,14,News 4 Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the home of Chris and Linda Stotch. They're living every parent's nightmare right now, as last night, while Ms. Stotch was driving with her son in the car, a man stopped her, put a gun to her head, and took her son away. When asked who the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, ""Some Puerto Rican guy."" Naturally, the police are in an all-out manhunt for Some Puerto Rican Guy. [the front door behind him opens and the Stotches appear] Uh, it looks like the parents are about to make a statement, Tom. [cameras start snapping pictures. Officer Barbrady and fellow police officers form a barricade to keep the crowd away from the podium.]"
148,5,14,Reporter 1,Mrs. Stotch? Mrs. Stotch? Any word yet from the man who took your son?
149,5,14,Linda Stotch,"No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us."
150,5,14,News 4 Reporter,"Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper look like?"
151,5,14,Linda Stotch,Puerto Rican.
152,5,14,Reporter 2,Was he tall? Short?
153,5,14,Linda Stotch,"He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me."

157,5,14,Busy Beaver Moving Company Truck Driver,"Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause I need some God-damned poontang."
158,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now. [dream sequence: the doors open and the family walks in] We'll walk in the front doors, [a smiling waitress welcomes them and leads them to their booth] and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth [Butters focuses on the booth bench, runs to it, and climbs on] Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers. [a waiter brings the dish over] Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers [he gets a tie, she gets the paint brush, and they smile at the gifts] Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''[the entire staff sings at the table as the family listens]
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
[the sequence is cut short as the driver gets annoyed]
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
[the truck stops and the driver exits to make his way to the passenger side]
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk? [the driver opens the door, plucks Butters out, set him by the side of the road, closes the door, and heads back for the driver's side. He gets in and drives off. Butters watches him go, then turns to face the receding truck...] He must like TGI Fridays."
159,5,14,Police Chief,Let us handle it. [looks towards the phone] Barbrady?
160,5,14,Barbrady,[answers the phone] Hello?
161,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?"
162,5,14,Barbrady,Who is this?
163,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, is this the Stotch residence?"
164,5,14,Barbrady,Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?
165,5,14,Butters Stotch,...No.
166,5,14,Barbrady,"Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?"
167,5,14,Butters Stotch,[looks down and checks himself out] ...No.
168,5,14,Barbrady,"We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day. [hangs up and faces the family and officers] It wasn't the abductors, sorry."
169,5,14,Officer 1,[enters the front door] Chief! Two more parents from the next town over have shown up saying their child might have been killed by the same guy that took the Stotch boy.
170,5,14,Police Chief,Really?
171,5,14,Officer 2,"[enters with the couple] This is John and Patsy Ramsey, from Boulder."
172,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"[they rush onto the sofa] We saw your story on the news, and we were so sorry to hear about your loss."
173,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"Our daughter was killed a few years ago, in our house."
174,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Yes, I... remember hearing something about that."
175,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,A and we realized... The man that murdered your son must be the same person that killed our daughter!
176,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"Yes, because we certainly didn't do it! No. [they both laugh nervously]"
177,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"No, huh."
178,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,No.
179,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well, our son was ab-ducted. We don't know that he's dead yet."

188,5,14,Gas Station Mechanic,"Well, then, looks like you're walkin'."
189,5,14,Butters Stotch,Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? [points to the road on the left]
190,5,14,Gas Station Mechanic,"'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod. [the camera pans to the right and stops at a terrifying road. It is lined with spooky trees with faces on them, dark threatening clouds overhead, and eerie sounds.] 'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod."
191,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[unsure, blinks] ...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow, [starts walking] and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em."
192,5,14,Gas Station Mechanic,"Well, uh good luck then."
193,5,14,Butters Stotch,Oh jeez. [he enters the gloomy forest]
194,5,14,Gas Station Mechanic,[watches Butters leave] ...or is South Park down that rod?
195,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"It's so very hard to lose a loved one, isn't it?"
196,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Yes, it, it sure is."
197,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,Thank goodness we have each other to share our grief.
198,5,14,Linda Stotch,Thank goodness.
199,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,[points towards the entrance] Here he is. [a door is heard opening and in walks...]
200,5,14,A Politician,John! Patsy!
201,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit. [Condit approaches the table, waves hello, and takes a seat next to Linda] He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids."
202,5,14,Congressman Gary Condit,We're goin' tuh get that sonofabitch! [grins. That grin is fixed in place]
203,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Yes, I'd I sure hope we do."
204,5,14,Congressman Gary Condit,"I spoke with the FBI and Some Puerto Rican Guy has just made their Number One Most Wanted, heh."
205,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"Oh, good. Maybe now they'll catch him. [the door is heard opening again] Oh, here's another member of our support group. [waves hello] O.J."
206,5,14,O J Simpson,[waves] Hey guys.
207,5,14,Congressman Gary Condit,"Chris, Linda, you know O.J. Simpson. [O.J. walks up and shakes Linda's hand]"
208,5,14,Linda Stotch,Oh. Sure.
209,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"O.J.'s wife was killed by an uh, Some Puerto Rican Guy, too."
210,5,14,O J Simpson,"Yup, it was Some Puerto Rican Guy all right."
211,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,"So you see, Chris and Linda, there are people like you all over the country who've been affected by Some Puerto Rican Guy."
212,5,14,Congressman Gary Condit,Hey! Let's make Chris and Linda an official part of the group.
213,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,Yeah!
214,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,Yeah!
215,5,14,O J Simpson,Alright!
216,5,14,John and Patsy Ramsey,[waves her knife like a conductor's baton] One of us! One of us!
217,5,14,Congressman Gary Condit,Gooble gobble gooble gobble!
218,5,14,O J Simpson,[joins Condit] One of us!
219,5,14,The Ramseys and Condit,One of us! One of us!
220,5,14,O J Simpson,One of us! Gooble gobble!
221,5,14,The Ramseys,Gooble gobble! Gooble gobble! One of us! One of us! [the Stotches look at the other four in fear]
222,5,14,O J ,Gooble gobble! Gooble gobble! One of us! One of us! [the Stotches look at the other four in fear]
223,5,14,Congressman Gary Condit,Gooble gobble! Gooble gobble! One of us! One of us! [the Stotches look at the other four in fear]
224,5,14,Butters Stotch,"For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
[a shadow flies over the trees in front of him, and an eerie cry is heard. He stops]
Buffalo wings and fried cheese sticks, the best are found at... Bennigan's
[a snarling sound is heard. He stops and turns right, looking into the trees]
Uhuh, hello?
[after a while of looking, he turns left and starts walking again]
So come and eat at..."
225,5,14,A voice,[whispering] Why can't he see us?
226,5,14,Butters Stotch,"...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
[the eerie sound is heard again, and three red dots are aimed at his forehead - he has been targeted by someone, or something... He turns right again and looks into the trees. Someone looks back, and turns on thermal vision. A neon view of Butters is shown. Butters turns left and start walking again. The three dots remain trained on his forehead]
Oh, nutsack [moves his hands to his mouth and gasps a bit] Oops.

227,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",Everyone knows it's Butters!
228,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
229,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican! [rises] You have to learn to keep it straight!"
230,5,14,Linda Stotch,I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
231,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! [the door opens and Butters walks in]"
232,5,14,Linda Stotch,Don't forget: your lies started all this. [Butters closes the door]
233,5,14,Chris Stotch,"My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! [Butters approaches and looks]"
234,5,14,Butters Stotch,Happy Anniversary!
235,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Not now, Butters!"
236,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. [moves off to his left] Alright, then. I-"
237,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Butters?? [spots him and scoops him up, then shares him with Chris]Oh, Butters!"
238,5,14,Chris Stotch,Son! I don't believe it! [they both drop on one knee as they hold on to Butters]
239,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-"
240,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Oh, my baby's back!"
241,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I ain't grounded, am I?"
242,5,14,Chris Stotch,"No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why... [relief fades to spin] Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?"
243,5,14,Butters Stotch,Lie?
244,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home."
245,5,14,Chris Stotch,No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! [both parents set Butters down and rise]
246,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!"
247,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary."
248,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[over Butters' voice] Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!"
249,5,14,Linda Stotch,"You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!"
250,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh stop it, Mom and Dad."
251,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!"
252,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Now gosh darn it, you! [steps in between his parents] You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble! [Chris and Linda listen] Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here [puts his right hand to his chin, palm down] with you two! [a few seconds of silence follow]"
253,5,14,Chris Stotch,...Butters... You're as right as rain.
254,5,14,Linda Stotch,[genuflects and messes with Butters' hair] You sure are.
255,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?"
256,5,14,Linda Stotch,"No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world. [Chris walks over to the phone as Linda and Butters look at each other] And I am so happy you're alive."
257,5,14,Butters Stotch,"...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?"
258,5,14,Chris Stotch,"You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing...]"
259,5,14,Chris Stotch,"We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. [Butters comes out of the house to stand next to his parents, and cheers are heard in the crowd. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are present]"
260,5,14,Man in Crowd,"Wow, alright"
261,5,14,Stan Marsh,Butters was missing?
262,5,14,Chris Stotch,"But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us."
263,5,14,Butters Stotch,[points at the crowd] Yeah!
264,5,14,Linda Stotch,We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
265,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah! [a shot of the Ramseys, O.J., and Condit]"
266,5,14,Chris Stotch,"You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers."
267,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[raises both arms in victory] Ye-! [turns to look at his father, and his arms go down] wait, what?"
268,5,14,Eric Cartman,Huho!
269,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[Butters is now afraid of what she might say] And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im."
270,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!"
271,5,14,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude."
272,5,14,Chris Stotch,"So you see, there was no ""Some Puerto Rican Guy."" He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, ""You're a liar! You're a LIAR!"" [points at the crowd, and Condit's fixed-grin face is shown] ""You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!"" [back to Chris] Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, ""Hello,"" but they'd be thinking, ""Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"" [a shot of O.J.] ""You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!"" [back to Chris] And to me, people might say things like, [a shot of Condit] ""LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!"" [back to Chris] And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like, [a shot of the Ramseys] ""You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!"" [a shot of O.J.] ""CONFESS!"" [a shot of Condit] ""LIAR! CONFESS!"" [back to Chris] You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth."
273,5,14,Linda Stotch,We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
274,5,14,Chris Stotch,"And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's."
275,5,14,Man 2 in Crowd,"Yeah-ah-alright! [the parents go back in the house as a stunned Butters stands on the walkway. The crowd disperses and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk up to Butters]"
276,5,14,Stan Marsh,"Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you."
277,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now."
278,5,14,Eric Cartman,We sure are.
279,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay."
280,5,14,Stan Marsh,Really?
281,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Naw, I'm lyin'"
282,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[appears in the doorway] Let's go, son."
283,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Wuh comin', Dad! [goes inside the house]"
284,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",Everyone knows it's Butters!
285,5,14,Butters Stotch,[returns to the doorway and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
