0,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts."
1,5,2,Stan Marsh,"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know."
2,5,2,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
3,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"Well, now, that's part of the fun."
4,5,2,Randy Marsh,Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
5,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. [all but Cartman laugh]"
6,5,2,Eric Cartman,That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
7,5,2,Stan Marsh,"[calling to the back] Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??"
8,5,2,Timmy Burch,Hyeah Timmay!
9,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, he's excited."
10,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Hey, fellas!"
11,5,2,Eric Cartman,"[flatly] Hey, Butters."
12,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody."
13,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine."
14,5,2,Stuart McCormick,You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
15,5,2,Big Gay Al,[suddenly steps in] Hello scouts!
16,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey, it's Big Gay Al!"
17,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!"
18,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
19,5,2,Randy Marsh,You're the new scout leader?
20,5,2,Big Gay Al,"[walks around the boys and stops behind the dads, hugging them] I just got transferred in. [lets go of the dads and moves further into the room] I think everyone's here now, so we can get started. [stops] Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do! [moves again]"
21,5,2,Boys,"Hooray! [they start moving, too]"
22,5,2,Stan Marsh,"See ya, Dad!"
23,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses. [Randy and Stuart look on a bit longer, then turn around and walk out. Close-up on the table reveals four older scouts, two on either side of Big Gay Al] Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!"
24,5,2,Timmy Burch,[happily] Timmay!
25,5,2,Big Gay Al,So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy! [points to his right. Jimmy walks up using his crutches.]
26,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Well hello everyone. [applause]
27,5,2,Timmy Burch,Ji- Jimmay?
28,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!"
29,5,2,Randy Marsh,He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
30,5,2,Stephen,Well how gay is he?
31,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"He's really, really gay."
32,5,2,Token s father,"Well then, I don't want my boy there, either. [more argument ensues]"
33,5,2,Randy Marsh,So he's a homosexual. So what?
34,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??"
35,5,2,Skeeter,"You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. [more argument]"
36,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Aw, that's ridiculous."
37,5,2,Priest Maxi,"[walks in] People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back."
38,5,2,Man,"[voice only] That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!"
39,5,2,Man 2,[voice only] That's right.
40,5,2,Man 3,[voice only] You did.
41,5,2,Big Gay Al,"And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy. [Jimmy walks into view] Let's give him a big hand. [applause]"
42,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a great audience. [applause dies down] Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B. [the other kids laugh] You guys like im- personations? [applause]"
43,5,2,Timmy Burch,[displeased] Timmy.
44,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"How about Jimmy Stewart? ""Merry Christmas, movie house."" And John Travolta. ""Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"""
45,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Jimmy's funny, dude."
46,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!"
47,5,2,Timmy Burch,[gets angry and crosses his arms] Hmph! [the doors open and in walk Randy and Stuart]
48,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock."
49,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stanley."
50,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck."
51,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?"
52,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey, yeah!"
53,5,2,Timmy Burch,[brushing off the idea] Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy. [camera pulls back to show Jimmy walking up]
54,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?"
55,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas."
56,5,2,Randy Marsh,"[the other scouts leave] Come on, Stan."
57,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time."
58,5,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, see ya.)"
59,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Bye, Jimmy."
60,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Bye, Jimmy."
61,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas."
62,5,2,Stan Marsh,"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!"
63,5,2,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
64,5,2,Stan Marsh,"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!"
65,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale."
66,5,2,Stan Marsh,"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!"
67,5,2,Timmy Burch,"[outside, visibly upset] Yahahah!!!"
68,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale."
69,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose. [Randy bears down on the brakes, causing Timmy to roll backwards and into the back window]"
70,5,2,Timmy Burch,Ah.
71,5,2,Randy Marsh,[to Stan] What did you say?!
72,5,2,Stan Marsh,"[a bit softly, eyes fixed on his fater] I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose."
73,5,2,Stuart McCormick,Uh huh!
74,5,2,Randy Marsh,"You do not say ""Big silly goose""! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!"
75,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-"
76,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!"
77,5,2,Stan Marsh,[glances at Cartman] ...Asshole. [looks at Randy again]
78,5,2,Randy Marsh,That's better.
79,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch."
80,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! [Jimmy walks up on crutches to the mic and begins]"
81,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired! [male laughter] What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush."" [laughter]"
82,5,2,Sharon Marsh,[heartfelt] What a brave little boy.
83,5,2,Sheila Broflovski,"He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! [Timmy, upset, sighs and crosses his arms]"
84,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park. [more people gather] H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? ""Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!"" [more laughter]"
85,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Hehe, I don't sound like that."
86,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"And how about that school counselor? ""Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."" [Mackey happily nudges a man to his right] ""Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?"" [Timmy is stewing in his anger] Wow, what a great audience. ""Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-"" [Garrison grins] ""Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat"" [more laughter] ""I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch."" [Chef looks flattered] ""Salisbury steak for lunch."" Eh. Uh. ""Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"" [more, stronger laughter and applause] And of course, my very favorite, ""Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!"" [the laughter and applause get louder, and Timmy gets livid] ""Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy."" Heh. Sometimes it's like, ""Please, Timmy, learn a new word,"" heh. ""Timmy! Tu-Timmy!"" [more laughter]"
87,5,2,Timmy Burch,"[angrily] Aaaaaaah! [Stan notices. Quickly, Timmy takes a cake half and throws it right at Jimmy, and it hits. Jimmy leans to his left, and stabilizes himself]"
88,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake. [cheers and claps abound]"
89,5,2,Man,Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my
90,5,2,Timmy Burch,[wailing] Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!
91,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice."
92,5,2,Big Gay Al,[enters the room] Hi ya fellas! [waves his left arm quickly]
93,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"How are you today, Scout?"
94,5,2,Big Gay Al,"I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!"
95,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay."
96,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?"
97,5,2,Scoutmaster 1,"Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong."
98,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts."
99,5,2,Big Gay Al,[Softly. Somber music plays.] Out of... Scouts?
100,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al."
101,5,2,Big Gay Al,But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.
102,5,2,Scoutmaster 2,"Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral."
103,5,2,Big Gay Al,I see...
104,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,It's nothing against you personally
105,5,2,Big Gay Al,What if I promise not to be gay anymore? [holds up a pinky] Pinky swear.
106,5,2,Scoutmaster 2,We think it's best you just... move on.
107,5,2,Big Gay Al,"[rejected] Right. Move on. [turns around, sighs, and walks out]"
108,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet."
109,5,2,Timmy Burch,[holding a gift] Timmih.
110,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,What's that?
111,5,2,Timmy Burch,"Hur livin' a lah, Timmih. [presents the gift]"
112,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,A present? You got me a p-present?
113,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
114,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"...[takes the gift] Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent. [opens the present] If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh? [pulls out the contents] Wow, a parka. [an orange one] You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim."
115,5,2,Timmy Burch,[all smiles] Tim-Timmy.
116,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits. [Timmy grins with anticipation as Jimmy dons the parka. Next shot is of Jimmy looking suspiciously like Kenny] This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around. [turns around to walk away]"
117,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [grins]
118,5,2,Jimbo and Ned,"There he is! Kill him! Kill him! [Ned fires three times] Oh, wait, that's not him. [the two men withdraw, and Jimmy keeps walking]"
119,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[calling back] Thanks again, Tim-Tim."
120,5,2,Timmy Burch,[thwarted] Tim-Timmay!
121,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Ah, bye, Scouts. [closes the drawer. The camera pans to show a man playing a piano] Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now."
122,5,2,Marc (Marc Shaiman),"Hey, don't yell at me! Ya asked me to come over and play sad songs for you to pack to, and then ya yell at me."
123,5,2,Big Gay Al,"[approaching] I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... ""I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay"" music."
124,5,2,Marc (Marc Shaiman),"[starts playing sprightly music] Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me."
125,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Oh! [buries his face in his left hand] Jesus, Marc."
126,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual."
127,5,2,Randy Marsh,Nice to meet you.
128,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends."
129,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"Your wife, huh?"
130,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.
131,5,2,Randy Marsh,"[nudges Stuart, who then smiles] Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then."
132,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Gonna go pound some brews, huh?"
133,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"And so I said to him, ""Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."" [the other scouts laugh] Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?"
134,5,2,Timmy Burch,[resisting] Timmay.
135,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim. [the boys laugh, and Jimmy approaches] Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too. [laughter. Timmy gets angry when Jimmy offers him a Dr. Seuss-like hat.] Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat. [Timmy throws the hat down. Jimmy picks it back up and offers it again.] Just for a second, Timmy. [Timmy throws the hat back at him, an dhe picks it up again] Don't be a jerk, Timmy. [approaches with the hat, but Timmy smacks him away] Hey, don't push me!"
136,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [turns his chair to face Jimmy directly]
137,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Cripple fight! [the other boys cheer, but Mr. Grazier bursts through the doors]"
138,5,2,Mr Grazier,"That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats! [the boys turn left and go to their seats]"
139,5,2,Eric Cartman,Awww!
140,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier! [paces back and forth between tables] Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right! [there's no answer] When I ask you a question you will answer ""Yes, Scoutmaster!"" Do I make myself clear?!"
141,5,2,Other Scouts,"Yes, Scoutmaster!"
142,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be... [hushed] naked pictures [brings forth a camera] I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later."
143,5,2,Other Scouts,Awww.
144,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! ""We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"""
145,5,2,Eric Cartman,"[to Kenny] Man, this guy sucks."
146,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!"
147,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show. [pulls out a smiling Scout hand puppet] Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens. [pulls out a hammer with his left hand and whacks away at the puppet on his right hand. The Scouts are frightened] Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw! [his right hand is bleeding, leaving a small pool of blood under the puppet] Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!"
148,5,2,Other Scouts,"Yes, Scoutmaster! [the parents enter to pick up their boys]"
149,5,2,Mr Grazier,"[now hiding his right hand] Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we?"
150,5,2,Other Scouts,"Yes sir Scoutmaster! [the troops break and go to their parents. Mr. Grazier walks over to Randy and Stuart, with his right hand behnd his back]"
151,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape."
152,5,2,Stuart McCormick,Yeah. Now they're acting like men.
153,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside."
154,5,2,Randy Marsh,You bet.
155,5,2,Stuart McCormick,I heard that.
156,5,2,Randy Marsh,"See ya, Mr. Grazier. [Randy and Stuart walk out. Mr. Grazier waits till they're gone and then pulls out the pictures he'd just taken and reviews them]"
157,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Go away! I'm dead! [the door closes, and soon the South Park troop comes into view and stands in front of him]"
158,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh, well, here he is."
159,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!"
160,5,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
161,5,2,Big Gay Al,"I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts."
162,5,2,Stan Marsh,Kicked out? Oh no!
163,5,2,Eric Cartman,But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
164,5,2,Big Gay Al,Really? wull-why?
165,5,2,Butters Stotch,[pause. Stan and Cartman look to him] We can't tell you.
166,5,2,Big Gay Al,Why not?
167,5,2,Butters Stotch,"[approaches the kidney-shaped table and demonstrates] Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! [Al is shocked at the implication]"
168,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week."
169,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals."
170,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much."
171,5,2,Stan Marsh,What do we want?
172,5,2,Boys,Gays in Scouts!
173,5,2,Stan Marsh,When do we want it?
174,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
175,5,2,Stan Marsh,What do we want?
176,5,2,Boys,Gays in Scouts!
177,5,2,Stan Marsh,When do we want it?
178,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
179,5,2,Stan Marsh,What do we want?
180,5,2,Randy Marsh,"[slowly, as the boys and Stan continue] Oh, no."
181,5,2,Boys,Gays in Scouts!
182,5,2,Stan Marsh,When do we want it?
183,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
184,5,2,Stan Marsh,What do we want?
185,5,2,Boys,Gays in Scouts!
186,5,2,Stan Marsh,When do we want it?
187,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [the boys approach Henry's Supermarket]
188,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. [a little girl stands at the market's entrance]"
189,5,2,Little Girl,Puppies. Puppies for sale.
190,5,2,Eric Cartman,"[moves over to her] Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! [takes her box and looks inside, then tosses it away. She goes after the box]"
191,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, let's set up. [the table's legs come down and Cartman's picket is hung in front of the table. A mic and sound system are set up next to the table. A customer exits the market, and Stan whips out a petition board] Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? [the customer gets away, but another one comes] Uh, hello, gays in Scouts? [the customers ignore him] Goddamnit! [All the while Timmy looks down angrily at Jimmy]"
192,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?"
193,5,2,Stan Marsh,"That's a great idea! [takes the mic] Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!"
194,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[takes the mic] Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim. [Jimmy gets the big hat and turns to give it to Timmy, only to see him wheel away. Jimmy follows, and they end up in a parking lot away from the market] Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!"
195,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
196,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!"
197,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
198,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Put on the hat!
199,5,2,Timmy Burch,[smacks the hat down] Timmay!
200,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Pu-put it on!!
201,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. [he and Cartman leave the table and go towards Jimmy and Timmy. Timmy and Jimmy face off and start circling each other]"
202,5,2,Timmy Burch,[makes a fist] Timmih. Timmih.
203,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Not this year.
204,5,2,Timmy Burch,"Timmih, Timmih."
205,5,2,Eric Cartman,Cripple fight!
206,5,2,Timmy Burch,Haaa.
207,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Come on. Come on!
208,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
209,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Cripple fight! [after a moment, the congregants get up and leave]"
210,5,2,Eric Cartman,"[on speakers] Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! [the shoppers abandon their carts and exit]"
211,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Come on!
212,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,[struggling to get up] Uh.
213,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ, dude! [a crowd begins to gather]"
214,5,2,Susan,Oh my God!
215,5,2,Man 5,"Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon. [Jimmy gets up quickly and faces Timmy again]"
216,5,2,Timmy Burch,Hahnah Timmih.
217,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[swipes at him, but Timmy blocks] Huah!"
218,5,2,Timmy Burch,Hahnah Timmih.
219,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[swipes at Timmy again, but Timmy blocks] Come on!"
220,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
221,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"No! [swipes at him again, but Timmy blocks and quickly delivers a blow to the face, drawing fist blood] Ow!"
222,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Timmy? Timmy? [Timmy takes his hand and slowly rises to his feet. Jimmy helps him into the chair]I told you to put on the HAT!! [swings his right crutch and blows Timmy out of the chair again. Jimmy walks up to Timmy and pulls him up by the hair, and swings the right crutch at him, but Timmy blocks it and holds both crutches down] You dirty motherfucker! [hits Timmy with the crutches, and Timmy responds with a headbutt, knocking Jimmy down. Timmy goes down himself]"
223,5,2,Man 5,[just arriving] What's goin' on?
224,5,2,Man 6,[turns to answer] Some kind of gay pride rally.
225,5,2,Timmy Burch,Lah-livin' a lie!
226,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice."
227,5,2,Farmer,Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.
228,5,2,"Joe, of Joe n' Friends",[host of Joe n' Friends] This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
229,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off."
230,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"[voice only] The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as Always and 1941."
231,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,[at his desk] I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!
232,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred."
233,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,"[at her desk] It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate. [rises from her chair and pounds the desk] I am taking this case on, personally!"
234,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you."
235,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist. [pictured is Mr. Grazier being arrested, then his mug shot] This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now."
236,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,[voice only] Here's one. And here's another.
237,5,2,Stuart McCormick,Kenny?
238,5,2,Randy Marsh,Oh my God.
239,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here."
240,5,2,Man 6,"Alright, boys, break it up."
241,5,2,Bailiff,All rise.
242,5,2,Chief Justice,"In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!"
243,5,2,Crowd,Alright! Yeah! Woohoo! [more cheering]
244,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too."
245,5,2,Crowd,"Yeah! [more cheering. Timmy and Jimmy, bruised and battered, sit next to each other]"
246,5,2,Chief Justice,"And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!"
247,5,2,Crowd,"Hooray, yeah, yeah! [more cheering]"
248,5,2,Stan Marsh,We did it! We did it!
249,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,I did it! I did it! Haha! [the press gathers in around her.]
250,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,"Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are. [each of the three Scout elders is in a stock, and underneath each one is written ""HOMOPHOBE"" The crowd throws stones at them.] And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys [the big bird comes down and plucks Kenny right up. The other kids, Al, and Gloria move aside and return, the kids stunned] five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al. [moves aside]"
251,5,2,Big Gay Al,[as the crowd cheers] Thank you all very much. But I don't want this. [the crowd quiets down and gets confused]
252,5,2,Crowd members,What's he saying?
253,5,2,Stan Marsh,Huh?
254,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club."
255,5,2,Man,"Uh, Hooray!"
256,5,2,Another Man,"Hooray, hey!"
257,5,2,Stan Marsh,"So wait, did we do good?"
258,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh yeah, ah I think so."
259,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Eh, we kick ass."
260,5,2,Big Gay Al,"[approaching the boys] Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream! [moves along]"
261,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,[at the mic] You can't do this! You homophobe!
262,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts."
263,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
264,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts. [walks off]
265,5,2,Timmy Burch,Tim-mih.
266,5,2,Timmy Burch,"Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih. [on screen is a picture of Timmy and Jimmy, in a Photo Wiz program. Timmy traces a cutout around Jimmy's head] Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih. [he clips the head off and moves it to the right, and grins] Aaaaah."
267,5,2,Stan Marsh,"[stops at Timmy's room and enters. Timmy stops work to listen] Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! [walks out]"
268,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures."
269,5,2,Timmy Burch,"[rolls up to the scoutmaster] Uh, Timmih."
270,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Yes, Timmy? [Timmy hands him an envelope, which he opens. He takes out a picture] Oh dear. Jimmy?"
271,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Yes?
272,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.
273,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Out of Scouts? [the scoutmaster shows a picture of two naked men holding each other close from the waist down and looking at the camera. The paler man has Jimmy's head pasted over his]
274,5,2,Timmy Burch,"[with eyes half-closed, waves at Jimmy and grins] Tim-mih."
275,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"What? [the two other Scoutmasters come up behind Jimmy, pull him out of his chair, and carry him towards the entrance] Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!"
276,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay."
277,5,2,Butters Stotch,Me neither. [the two Scoutmasters prepare to toss him out the doors]
278,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,No! No! [the Scoutmasters toss him a good distance]
279,5,2,Timmy Burch,[triumphantly] Timmay!
