0,19,10,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others."
1,19,10,Russian 1,"[balding, with facial stubble] Is it him?"
2,19,10,Russian 2,"[with mustache] Yes, it's him. PC Principal."
3,19,10,PC Principal,"[walks up to the bar and puts his pickaxe aside, and drinks the glass of water waiting for him] You know, if there's one thing that makes me sick, it's when a race thinks they're superior and don't know how to check their privilege. [a Russian walks up to him and lays a hand on his shoulder. PC Principal responds with a right hook. A second Russian attacks, and PC Principal responds with a knee to the chest and slams him onto a table, which shatters under him. PC Principal then stands over him and stomps on his face, shattering his head to pieces. A third Russian lunges at him with a knife, but he kicks that Russian in the face, then delivers a head butt and snaps his neck in half. The remaining Russians back away. A fourth Russian attacks him, but he breaks that Russian's arm and punches him away. A fifth one attacks, and he punches him away. A sixth one attacks with a cue stick, but PC Principal snaps the stick in two and jabs the thick end into the Russian's right eye. A seventh one takes a shot at him, but he takes the gun and jabs the ax into the Russian's head. An eighth Russian walks up to him, but throws his hands up when PC Principal aims the gun at him.]"
4,19,10,Russian 3,I'm not one of them! I'm not one of them!
5,19,10,PC Principal,"An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father? [The Russian doesn't know how to answer] I didn't think you were human. [the Russian lunges at him, but he fires off four shots through the Russian's head and kicks him in the face. He then notices his axe and pulls it out of the seventh Russian's head. He turns around and walks out of the bar.]"
6,19,10,Butters Stotch,"[still in his halo, talking to Charlotte on his iPhone] Yeah, everybody's pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge and feelin' really nervous."
7,19,10,Charlotte,"That sounds terrible. Be careful, Butters."
8,19,10,Butters Stotch,"I will, honey."
9,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,Butters. [Butters' smile vanishes] Get to the bathroom. Now. [Butters is a bit alarmed]
10,19,10,Stan Marsh,"Alright Kyle, what's this about?"
11,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,Jimmy's dead.
12,19,10,Eric Cartman,What?
13,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away."
14,19,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Are you fuckin' serious, dude?)"
15,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology.
16,19,10,Stan Marsh,How do you know all this?
17,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe.
18,19,10,Butters Stotch,"Heh, [sing-song] Kyle's got a girlfriend?"
19,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired.
20,19,10,Eric Cartman,Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
21,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,I think it's obvious. Stan's dad.
22,19,10,Stan Marsh,Kyle!
23,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in."
24,19,10,Stan Marsh,"[gets in his face] You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you! [walks past him, opens the doors, and walks out]"
25,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,There's no way to know who we can trust.
26,19,10,Eric Cartman,So what do we do now?
27,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,There's only one thing we can do. [turns around] We have to get guns.
28,19,10,Butters Stotch,Guns?
29,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,It's the only way for us to be safe.
30,19,10,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?"
31,19,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?"
32,19,10,Kenny McCormick,(Now we need to steal a car and escape.)
33,19,10,Butters Stotch,I already feel a lot safer.
34,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected.
35,19,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner. [Kyle smiles and walks off. Cartman poses with his gun] Do I look sweet, Butters?"
36,19,10,Butters Stotch,[giggles] Yeah.
37,19,10,Randy Marsh,What?
38,19,10,Stan Marsh,What?
39,19,10,Sharon Marsh,"Can you pass the garlic bread, Randy?"
40,19,10,Randy Marsh,"Why wouldn't I be able to pass the garlic bread? [picks up the bowl and offers it to her. She takes some bread from it, and he sets it back where it was.]"
41,19,10,Stan Marsh,"Dad, where were you last night?"
42,19,10,Randy Marsh,"What, wait. Where was I what? Out, with friends, doing things. [wipes his face clean] Well I'm full. I'm gonna go work in the garage for a little bit. [leaves the table]"
43,19,10,Stan Marsh,Work on what?
44,19,10,Randy Marsh,"On stuff to do, things. [reaches back and takes some more food.] Um, oh I'm gonna take some of this with me. I'm still hungry."
45,19,10,Sharon Marsh,I thought you just said you were full.
46,19,10,Randy Marsh,Jee-sus! What? Am I on trial or something? God-damn! [takes the bowl of garlic bread] You guys are really acting strange. [his mouth remains a bit open as he walks away keeping an eye on the family]
