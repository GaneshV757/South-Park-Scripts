0,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Mornin' Randy!
1,19,4,Randy Marsh,"Mornin' Ger! Just another day in paradise, huh?"
2,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Yeah. Look at all the new restaurants the Whole Foods has brought in. [turns around and points at the restaurant behind them.] Let's try out that one there. [they walk towards it and reach the entrance. A greeter awaits them]
3,19,4,Randy Marsh,Hi. Two of us. please?
4,19,4,Greeter,"Yeah, sorry guys. we got about a thirty minute wait."
5,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[switches places with Randy] Oh, uh, scuse me. [whispers into the greeter's ear]"
6,19,4,Greeter,"Yes, sir, give me a second; I'll have a table right away. [rolls his eyes and walks off]"
7,19,4,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, what'd you say to him?"
8,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,I just... told him who I am.
9,19,4,Randy Marsh,Who are you?
10,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[whips out his phone and shows Randy the Yelp app] I'm a yelp reviewer. I usually keep it on the down-low so they don't kiss my ass too much.
11,19,4,Greeter,"[returns and gets two menus] Right over here, sir. [takes them to their seats]"
12,19,4,Waiter,"Alright guys, welcome to (vernacular)"
13,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Thanks, uh, did they mention to you that I am a Yelper?"
14,19,4,Waiter,"Yes, we've been alerted. Sir."
15,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Greeeat. Could you have them turn up the lights a little, please? [the waiter goes away]"
16,19,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh, look at it, Gerald. All the new families moving in. [a new Mexican restaurant - Nueva Familia - is having its grand opening across the street] Our little town is all grown up.
[Nueva Familia, across the street. A family-run restaurant. A boy sweeps up in the kitchen as his mother prepares some tacos on the griddle. His father rushes in.]"
17,19,4,Father,Where's that other taco plate? We need it now.
18,19,4,Mother,I'm a little overwhelmed.
19,19,4,Father,"I know. But we've put everything into moving here and starting this business, and we have to be impressive. [walks up to the boy and gets down on one knee] David, you must help your mama however you can. We're not going back to that miserable place!"
20,19,4,David,I don't wanna go back either.
21,19,4,Mother,"Okay, done."
22,19,4,Father,Great! [rises and goes for the plates] We really have to impress this customer. He's a local food critic. [rushes the plates out to the dining area]
23,19,4,Mother,Another one?
24,19,4,Father,"[rushes to his table with two plates of food] Okay, here you go, amigo! Another taco plate and the taquitos."
25,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?"
26,19,4,Father,"Yes, you mentioned that several times."
27,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard. [whips out his phone] I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars."
28,19,4,Father,Really?
29,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[wiping his mouth clean with his napkin] Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star."
30,19,4,Father,"Ohnono. No 1 star, please. What could we do to-?"
31,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts."
32,19,4,Father,Let me get that for you.
33,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Great, and can you turn down the music a bit? [taps his left ear a few times] This pagan shit hurts my ears."
34,19,4,Father,"Of course! [turns around and hurries away. A spritz is heard, and the camera shows David wiping down a table. Cartman notices]"
35,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor. [snaps his fingers and whistles] Busboy!"
36,19,4,David,My name is David. (Dah-veed)
37,19,4,Eric Cartman,Ehexcuse me?
38,19,4,David,I said my name is David. (Dah-veed)
39,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, it's actually pronounced ""David,"" okay?"
40,19,4,David,"Well, I'm ""David."" (Dah-veed)"
41,19,4,Eric Cartman,"It's ""David,"" dude. Look it up."
42,19,4,Father,"[comes out with a flan and a sundae on a plate] What's going on? Do not argue, son. We need him. [walks to Cartman's table and sets the desserts down] Here you are, a few free desserts. [the front door opens and some bells are heard] Ho, excuse me. More customers! [goes away]"
43,19,4,Male food critic,"[enters with his wife] Hi, two of us for lunch, please."
44,19,4,Father,"Yes, right away!"
45,19,4,Male food critic,"Oh, and uh, I just wanted to mention that my wife and I are Yelp reviewers, so uh, your best table, please."
46,19,4,Father,"Oh Jeez, you guys too, huh? Ho-kay, uhm, I'll get you set up right over here, okay? [takes them past Cartman, who casts a critical eye]"
47,19,4,Eric Cartman,Mmmhmmm! [The father takes them to a booth near Cartman]
48,19,4,Male food critic,"Hm, this place seems, nice."
49,19,4,Female food critic,I guess we'll see.
50,19,4,Male food critic,"D'I guess we'll see, won't we?"
51,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic."
52,19,4,Butters Stotch,Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Huh?
53,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[wearing a T-shirt that says ""WARNING: YELP critic"" on the front] Here you go. [takes a bag out of his back pocket and hands it to Butters]"
54,19,4,Butters Stotch,Whoooaaa. [opens the bag and begins eating what's inside.]
55,19,4,Eric Cartman,Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
56,19,4,Butters Stotch,"How do you do it, Eric?"
57,19,4,Eric Cartman,"I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want."
58,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Jeeeeezzz. [a second later, Kyle walks by with David]"
59,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,"So the cafeteria's back that way, and most of the classrooms are this way, down the-."
60,19,4,Eric Cartman,EEWW. [Kyle and David face him] What's the busboy doing here?
61,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,David is new to our school.
62,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school? [mimics a boy on a bicycle] Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?"
63,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,Shut up.
64,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant two stars, but it could have been worse."
65,19,4,David,Why'd you only give them two stars?
66,19,4,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all."
67,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,It's not supposed to have water you-!
68,19,4,Eric Cartman,"It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David."
69,19,4,David,David.  (Dah-veed)
70,19,4,Eric Cartman,David.
71,19,4,David,Dah-víd.
72,19,4,Eric Cartman,David.
73,19,4,David,Dah-víííd.
74,19,4,Eric Cartman,"David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude. [David turns around and walks away. Kyle turns around, looks at Cartman, and follows David away. A few second later Cartman relaxes] ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic."
75,19,4,Gerald s review,"And yet, there was more. For in this crisp time when autumn begins to fade, the chef brings chicken in habanero, and even adds habanero powder to the crust. But the heat is restrained. You experience the fruity, delicious flavor of this without any spicy pain. I don't need any more pain. Hell, does anyone?"
76,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[appears at the den doorway with Ike] Gerald! We're going to the park. You wanna come along?
77,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Sorry honey, this review for Applebee's has turned into a fifty-pager. And then I have a polish on Ruby Tuesday's."
78,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Why don't you take a break from Yelping, Gerald? You seem a little overwhelmed."
79,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[leans back on his chair] I am, overwhelmed. Sometimes I don't know what I've gotten myself into. But now everyone relies on my Yelp reviews and I... I don't wanna let anyone down."
80,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Well there's chicken in the fridge if you get hungry.
81,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Thanks, but I, I've gotta Yelp a new place in CtPaTown tonight. [leans forward a bit] God I'm so damned tired."
82,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Okay. Have fun.
83,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[to himself]Ha, ""fun,"" she says."
84,19,4,Gerald s review,"In finality, I will say that my experience at Applebee's was sublime and my treatment near that of a gladiator most decorated. But the street parking wasn't that great. Two and a half stars."
85,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[satisfied with his review Gerald leans back in his chair again commenting to himself] Yes.
86,19,4,Wendy Testaburger,"Come on, Liza, I'll introduce you to the girls."
87,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Well aren't you eatin' lunch, Eric?"
88,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food."
89,19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"O-okay, Here you are sir! There's orange-peel chicken, some uh shity beef, and uh shitty egg roll!"
90,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,Are you joking?!
91,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only [emphasis] one star late."
92,19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh no! No one star, prease! You Uelpers are kriwing me! Okay, you no pay! You no pay, prease!"
93,19,4,Eric Cartman,Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.
94,19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,Yes yes. I get the fuck out. Thank you! [hurries away]
95,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Wow! Well you're pretty important, Eric."
96,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,He's not important. At. All.
97,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?"
98,19,4,Stan Marsh,Stop it.
99,19,4,Eric Cartman,"What? I just want to hear him say ""Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool."""
100,19,4,David,"Sí, me ride me teeny bicicleta to school."
101,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[laughs] That's awesome! [turns around on the bench] I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. [leaves the table. David leaves his seat]"
102,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, [facepalm] don't, dude, dude- Don't."
103,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","Sir, it's midnight. Go home, get some sleep."
104,19,4,Sgt Yates,There's no time to sleep when the city's counting on me.
105,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","More Yelp reviews, sir?"
106,19,4,Sgt Yates,"I had a bad experience at Red Lobster and if the people don't know about it, they could too. Folks deserve to know where to eat, Mitch."
107,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",But does anyone even thank you for it?
108,19,4,Sgt Yates,"I don't need them to. I know they need me, and that's enough."
109,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","[pats him on the left shoulder] God bless you, sir."
110,19,4,Sgt Yates,I know. [Barkley walks away]
111,19,4,Whistlin Willy,Welcome to Whistlin' Willy's. Y'all enjoyin' your pizza?
112,19,4,Male food critic,"Look here, my good man, we've been waiting over 15 minutes for you to sing Happy Birthday to our son!"
113,19,4,Female food critic,"Unfortunately for you, we are both restaurant critics, and so is our son!"
114,19,4,Son,[gets an angry face] One star!
115,19,4,Diner 1,"Excuse me! Emergency! [Whistlin' Willy rushes over to see what's up] Over here! Emergency! I would like a table. Inside the area with all the little plastic balls please, and make it snappy I am a food critic for Yelp."
116,19,4,Whistlin Willy,That does it! I've had enough! All you Yelp reviewers get the hell outta here! I don't care what happens to my business! I ain't kissing your asses no more! [moves the male food critic from the table to the double doors on his chair and throws him against the doors] Go on! Every Yelper get the fuck out of here!
117,19,4,Diner 2,"Careful now, Bill, you don't want a one-star review."
118,19,4,Whistlin Willy,"You're not a food critic, Dennis! You're a fuckin' mechanic! Now get the fuck out! Go on! All you Yelpin' sons of bitches get the fuck out of here! [Yelpers begin to stream out of the restaurant]"
119,19,4,Male food critic,"You're gonna regret this, Whistlin' Willy. You can't treat Yelpers this way."
120,19,4,Whistlin Willy,You get the f- Get the fuck out! [kicks the male food critic in the ass for emphasis as the critic goes out the door.]
121,19,4,Male food critic,AH! [Whistlin' Willy slams the door shut. Gerald shows up a few seconds later]
122,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Well, good for you."
123,19,4,Whistlin Willy,"You too, you sonofabitch!"
124,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Whoa! Hey! [Whistlin' Willy kicks him out too, and Gerald rubs his butt outside]"
125,19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"It's oba! It's oba! [screams some more and approaches Nueva Familia.] You see papaa?! It's oba! [David's father steps outside and Mr. Kim stops him] Whistrin' Wirry! He stand up to the Yelpas! [David's father scans the front page] We don't have to kiss uh their asses anymore! Look! [David's mother comes out to join his father] Everyone is doing the same! [signs go up saying ""No Yelpers""] Ha haha. It's ova it's ova! Hey Skeetah, you hear the news?! [He runs off continuing his celebration]"
126,19,4,Father,[softly] It's a ...miracle. [jubilantly] IT'S A MIRACLE! [he and his wife hug]
127,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Hm hm hm the fuck? [notices a small puddle on the floor] Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor! [notices David at his locker] Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David. [whistles] Over here, there's some shit on the floor. [David closes his locker and turns away] Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man?"
128,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,[arriving] You haven't heard? Nobody gives a fuck what Yelp reviewers think anymore.
129,19,4,Eric Cartman,"What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little ""My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool"""
130,19,4,David,My name... is David.  (Dah-veed)[walks off]
131,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,HA! [walks off as well]
132,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[whips out his phone] Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it. [waits for a comeback but doesn't get one] You'd better say ""I ride me bicicleta to school""! [holds up his phone] One star! ... No s-no stars? [no reply. He sighs and tries again] No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys! [walks away. No one follows him. Seconds later he's back.] Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's kewl, you guys stay here. [leaves again]"
133,19,4,Butters Stotch,"[noticing] Oh, hey Eric."
134,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[hops onto Butters' bed and lays down] It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke."
135,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh I'm sorry, bud."
136,19,4,Eric Cartman,All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day.
137,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Well Eric, you should be proud that people wanna be like you. Ha ah, I mean, you really started something."
138,19,4,Eric Cartman,I guess.
139,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Well if these people look up to you, maybe, maybe you can sort of, set the record straight and show them the way it's supposed to be done."
140,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[sits up] You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again."
141,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","Harrison Yates, what's gotten into you?"
142,19,4,Yates,"That's it, Maggie. I'm hanging it up. If people are gonna be trying all the new restaurants in town they'll... have to do it without my reviews."
143,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",What are ya talkin' about? You said that protectin' people from bad dinin' experiences was what kept you goin'.
144,19,4,Yates,"The restaurants put up signs sayin' I can't come in. I don't know why they singled me out, but it's like, people don't need me. [opens a letter and reads it] Well I'll be damned."
145,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",What is it?
146,19,4,Yates,Somebody's put a note in the mailbox... asking me to come and talk to them. They do need me. [rises and goes to the coat rack] I need to get goin'.
147,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",You want me to come along?
148,19,4,Yates,"No, they're just asking for me. I guess... [opens the front door] maybe I do have a town to protect. [smiles and leaves]"
149,19,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, are you having a party sweetheart?"
150,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting."
151,19,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, how fun!"
152,19,4,Eric Cartman,"It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! [she goes away as he walks to the front door. He opens the door and sees a sea of reviewers]"
153,19,4,Yelpers,"Hello, hi. My name is [they all give their names at the same time] and I'm here for the meeting. [Cartman freezes up]"
154,19,4,A reviewer,Is this the right place?
155,19,4,Eric Cartman,Fuuuuuuck! [closes the door and keeps it closed with his back] Mom!
156,19,4,Liane Cartman,"I'm going, honey."
157,19,4,Eric Cartman,"But Mom, there's like a billion people here."
158,19,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh yes, sweetie, I think quite a few people are Yelp reviewers."
159,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!"
160,19,4,Liane Cartman,"I guess so, honey. Do you need more lemonade?"
161,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Mom, there's a fucking billion people here! [yes, Yelpers all up and down the block, filling the streets all around. Moments later, he appears at his bedroom window on the second floor, and holds court] Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-"
162,19,4,A Yelper,COULD YOU SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER?
163,19,4,Eric Cartman,Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
164,19,4,Other Yelpers,That's right! Yeah!
165,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic. [Sgt. Yates puffs up his chest, pretty sure that it's him] It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is."
166,19,4,Other Yelpers,That's right. Yeah!
167,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[confidently humble] Huh. Oh thanks.
168,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following [holds up index finger] one captain, we can fight to get our power back!"
169,19,4,A Yelper,Poweerrrrr Back!
170,19,4,Eric Cartman,"So now rise up, and [pounds on the window sill] fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!"
171,19,4,Other Yelpers,Yeah! Let's go! [more cheering from the Yelpers]
172,19,4,Sgt Yates,"Alright, follow me!"
173,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"This way, everyone! [the crowd turns left and moves off]"
174,19,4,Anchor Tom and Reporter,"Another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by Yelp reviewers. Whistlin' Willy's, a child favorite in town, was destroyed and its owner stripped and beheaded. The following video is graphic. [a crowd of Yelp reviewers is shown and they are ululating. Two Yelpers bring Whistlin' Willy in front of the camera and hold him there. The crowd continues to ululate]"
175,19,4,Whistlin Willy,"No, please! No! Nonono! [the Yelpers pull the mask off his head and show it off to the camera] Awwww. [the ululating continues]"
176,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,We all... loved... Whistlin' Willy's!
177,19,4,Eric Cartman,[just shrugs] It didn't do well with Yelpers.
178,19,4,Token Black,You assholes destroyed the best place in town because they wouldn't kiss your asses!
179,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked."
180,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody went for the fucking food!
181,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school?"
182,19,4,David,"Si. Me ride me teeny bicicleta to school. [turns around and walks away. Kyle flashes an angry look at Cartman, then watches David leave]"
183,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,[gets in Cartman's face] You're done! [turns around and walks away with the remaining boys]
184,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word! [softly] And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs."
185,19,4,Gerald s review,"I found the wait staff at Red Lobster to be rude, and barely even acknowledging who I was. Or what I meant to this city."
186,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[appears at the doorway with Ike] Gerald, I'm taking Ike to clown school. You care to joing us?"
187,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"I can't, honey. I'm now the leader of thousands of people. They all hang on my every word. And I'm going to use my power to finally get what this town really needs. [Sheila and Ike just walk away]"
188,19,4,Anchor Tom and Reporter,"For the fifth day in a row, historic Shi Tpa Town is under siege by Yelp reviewers. The restaurants are still refusing to be intimidated. and the Yelp reviewers are- [quickly ducks as the gunfire hits very close to him] -and the Yelp reviewers are preparing for all-out war. [real war footage is shown] The angry Yelp reviewers are demanding special treatment at all city restaurants. They claim that as local food critics they reserve respect, and that all who oppose them will suffer. The online restaurant critics are getting ready to bring businesses to their knees, and some are already closing their doors. [Nueva Familia is shown...]"
189,19,4,Anchor Tom and Reporter,One local restaurant worker actually called out the Yelp critics' leader.
190,19,4,David,"I guess you win, huh, big shot?! If you really are any kind of important to anybody, then get your bullshit food critic ass to the south of town and face me! Because you aren't a food critic, and you aren't important! [Sgt. Yates looks at the screen in the police station] And unless you're a chicken, I'll see you south of town! [Yates walks into his office and gets his coat]"
191,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","Where are you going, sir?"
192,19,4,Sgt Yates,"You heard him. Little Mexican kid called me out. [shows his gun, then places it back in its holster] If he wants to fight me, that's fine."
193,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",You need backup sir?
194,19,4,Sgt Yates,"No, he's just calling me out. [turns and walks out]"
195,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",God bless you sir.
196,19,4,Sgt Yates,I know!
197,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,"David! Dude, wait! [Kyle is next to him now] Dude, you don't wanna do this. You don't know what Cartman's capable of."
198,19,4,David,"Where I come from, we settle things with our fists!"
199,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,But this isn't Mexico.
