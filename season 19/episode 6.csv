0,19,6,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. [Wendy reads through some cue cards at the podium] Today we're going to be showing you some art from our Asian-American students-DAMMIT LESLIE, SHUT YOUR FUCKING PIE-HOLE! [Leslie is shown, but she's confused, as she's not talking to anyone.] from our Asian-American students presented by our student-body president, Wendy Testaburger."
1,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey guys. As you know, we have several new students here at South Park Elementary. We have been getting to know some of the Asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called ""yaoi."" [A picture on a slideshow showing the English and Japanese spellings of the word, and Oriental music plays.] Yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty involving two people whose love is looked down upon. The art tries to show that all love is magical, like in Lisa Akimoto's piece, ""Tweek and Craig - Forbidden Love."" [Tweek and Craig in a French kiss.]"
2,19,6,Asian Student Girls,Awwww.
3,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What?
4,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"Kelly Zhou goes a bit more whimsical with ""Craig and Tweek: Moonlight Dance."" [Tweek wears a pink bow in his hair and is wrapped in a pink ribbon while Craig stands behind him looking down at his face.]"
5,19,6,Asian Student Girls,Awwww.
6,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Dude, what the fuck?"
7,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"In yaoi art, the seme, or top, is usually dominating the uke, or bottom, as demonstrated in Heather Nishimura's ""Boizu Rabu."" [Craig reaching down into Tweek's briefs as Tweek reaches up to stroke Craig's head]"
8,19,6,Asian Student Girls,Awwww. [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
9,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,But yaoi can branch out to other things as well.
10,19,6,Eric Cartman,Uh oh.
11,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"As we see here in ""Lily, Frog, Tweek and Craig."" [Tweek is on his back with Craig on top of him pinning him down while looking into his eyes.]"
12,19,6,Stan Marsh,"I just don't get it. I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay. Right?"
13,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[questioning, seeking confirmation] No. We would know."
14,19,6,Butters Stotch,"Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that?"
15,19,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, what is this yaoi thing all about? I am so c-c-c-confused."
16,19,6,Stan Marsh,And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig... could it happen to any of us?
17,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Uhh, excuse me, why are you doing this?? [holds up a picture of himself pushing Tweek on a swing, and Tweek enjoying it]"
18,19,6,Girl 1,"""Oh, hi, Craig. 오늘 다른 셔츠 입었네. (He's wearing a different shirt today.) [looks at the girl on her right and addresses her] 잠바 밑에 어떻게 알아? (how do you know what's underneath his jacket?) [The girl replies.]"
19,19,6,Craig Tucker,What? Well what did she say?
20,19,6,Girl 3,"I don't know, that was Korean. I'm Japanese."
21,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"[Over caffeinated] What is going on, huh? Huh? Me and him aren't together. Why is this happening?!"
22,19,6,Girl 1,"[girl 1 addresses the girl to her left] 지금 크렉이 같이 있어줘야 하는데"". [(Craig should be along with Tweek.)]"
23,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Everyone thinks I'm gay! What if my parents find out! Huh!
24,19,6,PC Principal,"Alright guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me."
25,19,6,Craig Tucker,Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay?
26,19,6,PC Principal,What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that.
27,19,6,Craig Tucker,But we aren't! I'm not!
28,19,6,Tweek Tweak,I'm not either!
29,19,6,PC Principal,"That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent."
30,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What's that?
31,19,6,PC Principal,"IF there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration."
32,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Gah!
33,19,6,PC Principal,"Now, in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright?"
34,19,6,Craig Tucker,But I'm not gay!
35,19,6,PC Principal,"I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to touch Craig's penis, you can't just go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like ""Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?"" Okay? Let's try it out."
36,19,6,Tweek Tweak,NO!
37,19,6,PC Principal,You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important!
38,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Craig, can I touch your penis?"
39,19,6,PC Principal,"Okay, good. Now Craig, you might say ""You may touch my penis. I'm comfortable with that."" [Craig isn't happy with that line and waits for more] Or of course, you could say ""No, you may not touch my penis at this time."""
40,19,6,Craig Tucker,No you may not!
41,19,6,PC Principal,"Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now Craig, what would you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole?"
42,19,6,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, you should have a talk with Stan."
43,19,6,Randy Marsh,For what?
44,19,6,Sharon Marsh,"I guess something happened at school today involving two of Stan's friends,.. being gay?"
45,19,6,Randy Marsh,What?
46,19,6,Sharon Marsh,Yeah. Stan seems really perplexed.
47,19,6,Randy Marsh,Wow. Our town has only had a Whole Foods for three weeks and we already have our first gay kids. So cool. [smiles to himself]
48,19,6,Sharon Marsh,"Go talk to him, Randy, and be delicate."
49,19,6,Randy Marsh,Hey bud. How's it hangin'? [sits on the bed next to Stan]
50,19,6,Stan Marsh,"I'm confused, Dad. There was this thing at school."
51,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Well, guess what? You've got a really progressive PC dad who knows all about this stuff, okay? Go ahead, ask me anything."
52,19,6,Stan Marsh,I just don't understand how it's decided.
53,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Ah, well, you see, it's a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences."
54,19,6,Stan Marsh,"No, I mean like, what makes the Asians decide who they're gonna make gay?"
55,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[confused] The Asians? The Asians decide who's going to be gay? [feigns knowing, playing it off] Uh are y-, yeah, yeah they do. Uh, the Asians just, you know, the Asians pick who they pick, and um, it's al- it's, the way it's always been."
56,19,6,Stan Marsh,So you've heard of yaoi?
57,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[embarrassed, playing it off] Yeah, of course. Yaoi, anal intercourse, Maui Zaui, I, I know all this stuff, Stan."
58,19,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh hey, Thomas! Hey, we heard about Craig. We think it's just terrific."
59,19,6,Thomas Tucker,[turns around] What about Craig? [Stephen Stotch comes up behind him]
60,19,6,Stephen Stotch,"Thomas! I'm so glad that Craig is finally happy. [aloud to the other shoppers] Hey, it's Craig's dad, everybody. [shoppers around the store clap]"
61,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Tweek's out of coffee, honey."
62,19,6,Mrs Tweek,"Oh, here you go, kiddo. [fills Tweek's cup]"
63,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Tweek, is there anything you want to talk to us about?"
64,19,6,Tweek Tweak,No.
65,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"[slowly] Well, we heard that you're gay. And I want you to know we've never been so proud of you."
66,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Oh God. [lets his head hit the table, smashing into all of his food]"
67,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"We thought you were just a spaz, but to know that you've got so much going on inside."
68,19,6,Mom,"We're so proud of you, Tweek."
69,19,6,Tweek Tweak,AAaaagh!
70,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Knowing what I know now, I'm gonna be a much better dad to you. In fact, I just, I just want to give you some money, Tweek. [pulls out his wallet and then some bills] Can I give you some money? [Tweek looks up with mashed potatoes covering parts of his face] Here, I I love you so much, son. [hands Tweek the bills]"
71,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[thinking] Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass?"
72,19,6,Cupid Me,[flits in out of nowhere] Aw come on. What's wrong with two guys liking each other?
73,19,6,Eric Cartman,"I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?"
74,19,6,Cupid Me,"But if love is love, then it takes form in all shapes and sizes. Teehee."
75,19,6,Eric Cartman,"I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along."
76,19,6,Cupid Me,Really? Can I?
77,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you."
78,19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh thank you! I won't! [floats out and away, giggling all the while.]"
79,19,6,Cupid Me,You just need a little spark of magic. [shoots an arrow into Craig's head.] And now I'm gonna pee in your mouth. [does so and giggles] Love is in the air. [squeezes a last bit of pee out]
80,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Did you do it, Cupid-Me?"
81,19,6,Cupid Me,"I hit him with my love arrow, and then I peed in his mouth just for fun."
82,19,6,Eric Cartman,[laughs] That's awesome! [chuckles as Cupid-Me flits to his left side] That's so sweet.
83,19,6,Cupid Me,I thought you might like that.
84,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, dude. You're hilarious."
85,19,6,Cupid Me,"And do you think I'm cute, too? 'Cause I think you're kind of cute."
86,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[his smile vanishes] Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny."
87,19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh well, at least Tweek and Craig are in love now. [flits away]"
88,19,6,Eric Cartman,Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.
89,19,6,Stan Marsh,And so my dad talked to me about it.
90,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah?
91,19,6,Stan Marsh,"And my dad said that Asians have always done this, and they, like, do make people gay."
92,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[runs up to them] You guys! You guys, hurry!"
93,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,What?
94,19,6,Eric Cartman,"It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! [runs off. Stan and Kyle follow.]"
95,19,6,Craig Tucker,Got a fuckin' problem man?! [pushes Tweek back]
96,19,6,Tweek Tweak,You're the one with the fuckin' problem! [pushes Craig back]
97,19,6,Craig Tucker,I told you to stay a hundred yards from me!
98,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"You'd better not fuckin' push me again, man!"
99,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh-ho come on, you guys. Get a room. [Craig and Tweek start fighting. Soon Cartman grabs onto Kevin for support]"
100,19,6,PC Principal,Hello Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today.
101,19,6,Thomas Tucker,[at his office.] Craig? Craig got in a fight? [grins]
102,19,6,PC Principal,"Yes, with his boyfriend. Just a lovers' quarrel, probably. [Craig and Tweek are seated opposite]"
103,19,6,Craig Tucker,Goddammit!
104,19,6,PC Principal,"Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis."
105,19,6,Thomas Tucker,Oh God...! [facepalm]
106,19,6,PC Principal,"There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day."
107,19,6,Thomas Tucker,Money?
108,19,6,Xi Jinping,Wei? Ni hao [(Hello? Who is there?)]
109,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[on the other end, in his study] Uh, hi, Mr. Jinping. Thanks for taking my call, I was... just wondering if you could shed some light on how your people decide who will be gay and who will be straight."
110,19,6,Xi Jinping,What?
111,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[sighs] I'm sorry, I-I don't speak Asian, but... um, oh uh, oh, y-yao, yaoi. Yaoi, yes? Boizu rabu. Huh, how does that work?"
112,19,6,Xi Jinping,That-a come from-a Japan.
113,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh, it's Japan that decides? [Stan walks into the study.] How the hell do they actually make people geh-? [notices Stan] Aaaa-a-ah, Japan. Of course, is who does the yaoi to make people gay."
114,19,6,Xi Jinping,"They are dogs! [pounds his desk with his left fist] who refused, and not apologized, to the Chinese republic!"
115,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh huh, yes, that of course I do already know about homosexuality."
116,19,6,Delivery Man,"Hi, flower delivery for Eric Cartman? [Cartman hears this and looks over]"
117,19,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh my, how beautiful. [signs for the flowers and takes them to Cartman] Oh look sweetie, someone sent you flowers."
118,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[sets his phone down, takes the bouquet, and reads the attached note.] ""Can't we just try? Tee Hee."" Oh man."
119,19,6,Liane Cartman,"Who are they from, hon?"
120,19,6,Eric Cartman,Someone who needs a real talking to.
121,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing."
122,19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee. Aw, come on, let's be like Tweek and Craig. Everyone thinks they're kewl."
123,19,6,Eric Cartman,You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
124,19,6,Cupid Me,But I'm so attracted to you.
125,19,6,Eric Cartman,"I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me. [the smile leaves Cupid Me's face. Cartman's voice gets quieter] This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. [dejected, Cupid Me goes limp in mid-air.]"
126,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Well, hello Craig. Honey, it's Craig."
127,19,6,Mom,"Awww, hi Craig."
128,19,6,Craig Tucker,Is Tweek home?
129,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"He sure is. Come on in. [holds the door open for Craig. From his house, Randy gives Richard a thumbs up. Richard returns the gesture and closes the door, then joins Mrs. Tweek and Craig in the middle of the living room] Would you like to have some coffee, Craig?"
130,19,6,Craig Tucker,"No thank you, I just want to see Tweek."
131,19,6,Mom,Awww.
132,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Tweek's just up in his room playing. You can go on up. [Craig starts going upstairs] Oh, uh, but keep the door open, alright? [Craig gets mad at the insinuation. Richard says to his wife] They're so gay."
133,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Hey dude. [this makes Tweek spit out his coffee, and he gets off his chair]"
134,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"No, no! What are you doing here? [keeps his distance]"
135,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this."
136,19,6,Tweek Tweak,There's no stopping it! The whole world wants me to be something I'm not!
137,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Me too, dude! But there's something we can do."
138,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What??
139,19,6,Craig Tucker,We have to come out and say we're gay.
140,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What?! Are you insane?! The way everyone-!
141,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures! We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls."
142,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Like acting? No man, that is way too much pressure! I'll fail-"
143,19,6,Craig Tucker,"You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think."
144,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Agh. I'm a terrible actor.
145,19,6,Craig Tucker,"You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay?"
146,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Oh gah-okay. Oh God!
147,19,6,Thomas Tucker,"What did I do wrong, huh? Everyone's so damned happy, but... but why did this have to happen to my son?! What did I do to make my son like this?"
148,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Hey, hey, whoa, you didn't do anything."
149,19,6,Thomas Tucker,Oh what? You know about this?
150,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, let me handle this guys, I'm PC. Look Thomas, you need to understand that being gay isn't a decision. You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide who's gay and who's not. But it isn't all Asians, it's just specifically the Japanese, okay?"
151,19,6,Thomas Tucker,What?
152,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[turns around] Why do the Japanese make some people gay and others not? [turns around again] Well, it all goes back to World War II, and atrocities that happened in China called the Rape of Don King."
153,19,6,Skeeter,"Hey, you sure know a lot about this."
154,19,6,Randy Marsh,Yes I do.
155,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, I looked it up. Yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship."
156,19,6,Stan Marsh,But why?
157,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. But the point is, there's nothing about it that means Tweek and Craig are actually gay, at all."
158,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Hey Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work. [the smiles vanish]"
159,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"What? Why not? [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Davíd, and Butters arrive]"
160,19,6,Craig Tucker,"I'm sorry Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore. [turns to face the gathering crowd of kids] Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together."
161,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"We don't belong together? What suddenly changed, Craig?"
162,19,6,Craig Tucker,It's just that people are different. That's all.
163,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Uh huh. And who the hell is Michael?! Huh?! You wanna tell me that?! [jaws begin to drop]
164,19,6,Craig Tucker,"What? What are you, what are you talking about?"
165,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"I went through your phone when we went out last night, Craig! I saw your texts to Michael about hooking up with him!"
166,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened."
167,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, it's not?"
168,19,6,Craig Tucker,"No. [tries to get Tweek back on track] Uh look, we both know this is for the better."
169,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, don't use that lame shit on me, man! You don't wanna feel bad, so you try and tell me what I want?"
170,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here."
171,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"[tears up, voice cracks] Noho, you're not the bad guy! You're never the bad guy, are you?! You, you just step on people and you use them!"
172,19,6,Craig Tucker,"[tries again] You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary."
173,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Agh-I'm going too far?! What is wrong with you?
174,19,6,Craig Tucker,This wasn't part of the plan!
175,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Well guess what, Craig! Love doesn't follow a plan!"
176,19,6,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
177,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"[tears fill his eyes] I was totally wrong about you. I opened myself up and let you in. But you've got spikes, man. You've got spikes. [walks away. Before he goes off screen, he breaks out in a big grin.]"
178,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"[steps forward to Tweek's spot] Tweek. [glares at Craig, then follows Tweek concerned. Craig looks at the other kids, who glare at him and walk away. The Asian girls even leave their drawing tools behind]"
179,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Dude, seriously? Seriously?"
180,19,6,Mrs Tucker,"They... they broke up? [Thomas turns around and smiles at the news. He notices Craig walking up to the front door, head down, and lets him in. He notices Craig's mood and his smile disappears.]"
181,19,6,Eric Cartman,"What are you doing? This place isn't you. [Cupid Me is shown, with a mug of beer an empty scotch glass, and an ashtray full of cigarette butts.]"
182,19,6,Cupid Me,I'm just here to pick up on guys. Why? are you jealous?
183,19,6,Eric Cartman,No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
184,19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh, now you need me, huh? Fuck you, dude."
185,19,6,Eric Cartman,Fuck you.
186,19,6,Man 1,What is that kid doing here?
187,19,6,Man 2,He's just kind of talking to himself.
188,19,6,Eric Cartman,"The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help."
189,19,6,Cupid Me,"Well, I guess I could try now, in return for just... one date?"
190,19,6,Eric Cartman,[hushed shouting] I'm not homosexual!
191,19,6,Cupid Me,Then I guess I'm not interested.
192,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together."
193,19,6,Cupid Me,Teeheehee! Teeheeheeheehee!
194,19,6,Ruffians Bartender,"Hey kid, what do you think you're doing here?"
195,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? [the bartender doesn't see any friend with him]"
196,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Hi, is Craig here, sir?"
197,19,6,Thomas Tucker,Why can't you quit him? [begins to close the door-]
198,19,6,Mrs Tucker,Thomas!
199,19,6,Thomas Tucker,[lets Tweek in] Five minutes. He's in the back. [Tweek goes on in and goes out the sliding door in back. Craig is working on his bicycle.]
200,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Hey dude.
201,19,6,Craig Tucker,What do you want?
202,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"I thought when we broke up everything would get better. I was thinking maybe, we should say we're back together."
203,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you!"
204,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What does that have to do with anything?
205,19,6,Craig Tucker,"You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back?"
206,19,6,Tweek Tweak,You said to make it seem real.
207,19,6,Craig Tucker,Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks!
208,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"I'm so sorry, Craig. You, you made me believe in myself in a way I never have before. I didn't think I had any of that in me, but... you were right. I can do more than I think. You... changed something in me and I just... I wanna fix whatever's hurting you now. [Thomas, who's been looking out the window, begins to cry]"
209,19,6,Craig Tucker,I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else.
210,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Alright Craig. Alright. [turns left and walks away]
211,19,6,Thomas Tucker,"I can see how much they're both hurting, but... Can't you understand that in my time we just didn't accept this? [rests his head on his left hand] Maybe it's not so wrong, I, I just don't want it to be my son. [Cupid Me flits in and giggles]"
212,19,6,Cupid Me,You just need a little prick of magic. [shoots an arrow into Thomas' head] And I'll pee in your mouth a little bit. [follows through]
213,19,6,Thomas Tucker,"Then again, he's my son no matter what. I can't just shut down on him."
214,19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teeheeheehee. [flits away. Moments later, Thomas shows up at Craig's bedroom door. Craig is on his bed, sad]"
215,19,6,Thomas Tucker,"[enters] Son, you need to listen to me. [sits down on the bed] You can't fight being gay. I used to think that being gay was a choice, but, you don't get to decide. Japan picks who they pick, and that's that. I don't understand this stuff. Heck, I didn't even know Don King got raped, but... I do know that if you try and resist it, you make yourself miserable your whole life. Everyone was so proud of you, Ah I was just being selfish. I wanna be proud of you too. I like gay Craig. I love you. Here's a hundred dollars. [puts the bill in Craig's hand and walks out the door]"
216,19,6,Japanese singer,"Maybe we should go away.
Put cares aside for just a day."
217,19,6,Japanese singer,"The world we face is a-not so big.
Not if we are strong like Tweek and Craig.
Honto ni sekanda ga oichii"
218,19,6,Japanese singer,"Let's go back to when it was new.
Weren't we such happy peopleru?
Life was simple, problems vague. [several adults look through a window at Craig and Tweek as they play]
We had it all, a lot like Tweek and Craig. [Mayor McDaniels looks at the picture of her deceased husband, then holds it against her chest.]"
219,19,6,Japanese singer,"And in the darkness we all seek
A perfect love like Craig and Tweek.
We must fight or love's a goner.
We must hold Tweek and Craig with the
Highest honor! [Thomas suddenly walks up] Gambaro Irashai!
I hope you know when you are down [Xi Jinping, at his desk, suddenly gets up and kisses his secretary]
That you turned my life around. [Butters is Skyping with Charlotte]
Just like the quote from Shakespeare said
I'm your Tweek, [slowing] and you're my Craig."
220,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[in bed, moaning in a rhythmic fashion] Okay, okay, the date's almost over."
221,19,6,Cupid Me,[pops up behind Cartman] Teeheehee. Aren't you liking your massage?
222,19,6,Eric Cartman,It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
223,19,6,Cupid Me,"Well, I've got something you might like a little better. [goes back behind Cartman... and under...]"
224,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!"
225,19,6,Cupid Me,Teeheeheehee!
226,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God! [next, he's in the bathroom. Liane walks past, but stops to listen in] Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it! [Liane opens the door and sees Cartman masturbating furiously on the toilet] That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. [Liane closes the door]"
227,19,6,Liane Cartman,Awww.
