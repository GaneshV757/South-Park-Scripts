0,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[dialing] Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. [the boys quiet down and cover their mouths as the call goes through to City Wok, a Chinese restaurant.]"
1,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease."
2,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[the boys giggle] Hello, is this City Wok?"
3,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Yes, this Shitty Wok."
4,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[the boys giggle harder] Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef."
5,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,[writing] Shitty Beef...
6,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken."
7,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,[writing] Shitty Chicken... [the boys roar with laughter. Cartman rolls back on the sofa]
8,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude, look! [the others look up and the phone falls off Cartman's lap to the floor] It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!"
9,6,1,Subway Singer,"He's still lookin' good!
[a man appears eating a footlong subway sandwich. The name ""JARED VOGLE"" appears on the screen near the bottom]
His name is Jared
[he struts down a sidewalk. ""LOST 262 LBS."" appears on the screen]
His name is Jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches...
[a side shot of Jared walking smoothly behind a white picket fence in Downtown, then of slices of a party sub, then of the first sandwich]"
10,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh, hey, fellas."
11,6,1,Stan Marsh,Hey Kenny
12,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[upset] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!"
13,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Not-Kenny."
14,6,1,Commercial Announcer,"Hey South Park! [camera switches to the TV. Jared is shown munching away on a sub sandwich behind splash bubbles saying ""JARED LIVE"" ""FREE SUBS"" and ""LOSE WEIGHT"" and ""MEET JARED"" ""SOUTH PARK, COLORADO""] You can meet Jared IN PERSON March 6 at the Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square!"
15,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[excited] Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!"
16,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! That's today!
17,6,1,Stan Marsh,"We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! [Stan and Kyle hop off the sofa and head for the front door]"
18,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[angered] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!"
19,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[hops off and follows Stan and Kyle] Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny."
20,6,1,Butters Stotch,Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. [follows the other three. The phone remains on the floor]
21,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"[the receiver rattles with his voice] Hello! City Wok! City Wok, I take your order prease!"
22,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Excuse me? Could we get through here?
23,6,1,Herbert Garrison,"[turns around] Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours! [begins to dance]
His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-"
24,6,1,Randy Marsh,Here he comes! [the crowd turns left as one and starts clamoring. Jared struts towards the crowd as his theme song comes up]
25,6,1,Subway Singer,"He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches... [Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]"
26,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Thank you all so much. You know what? After a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy! [the crowd cheers] And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss!"
27,6,1,Some men,Alright! [more cheering]
28,6,1,Eric Cartman,That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
29,6,1,A Worker for Subway,"Mr. Vogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich?"
30,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Sure, let 'em in. [the worker lets the boys in and Jared spins around to face them] Hi kids. [the room Jared is in is a dressing room]"
31,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Wow, Jared!"
32,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
33,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side."
34,6,1,Stan Marsh,What kind of help?
35,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides."
36,6,1,Eric Cartman,A- AIDS?
37,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides.
38,6,1,Stan Marsh,I'll bet you can.
39,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Would you like to meet them?
40,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,[steps backwards] Them?
41,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",My aides. Scott! Tyler! [moves to the door. The two aides come in and Jared stands behind them. Then he looks at the blond to his left] Scott is my personal trainer [looks at the light brunet to his right] and Tyler is my dietitian.
42,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler",Hello.
43,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler",Hello.
44,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides."
45,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Yep. Hooray for aides!
46,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial."
47,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.
48,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular."
49,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?"
50,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It matters, dude. [Jared begins to think...]"
51,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Hmmm.
52,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
53,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass."
54,6,1,Eric Cartman,Oh-my-god! [turns around] You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
55,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Tha- that's diarrhea.
56,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise."
57,6,1,Stan Marsh,[following] Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
58,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[softly] That's right Stan. [bolder] It's a cash cow, I tell you."
59,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,That's a great idea!
60,6,1,Eric Cartman,Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
61,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[surprised, steps backwards] Me?!"
62,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?"
63,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one."
64,6,1,Eric Cartman,"I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!"
65,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,But Butters isn't fat.
66,6,1,Eric Cartman,"That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off."
67,6,1,Stan Marsh,"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster."
68,6,1,Butters Stotch,"But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me."
69,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!"
70,6,1,Butters Stotch,You mean like Jared?
71,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
72,6,1,Butters Stotch,[angrily] Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
73,6,1,Stan Marsh,"You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. [the boys begin to sway for each line]"
74,6,1,Eric Cartman,He used to be fat but not no more [Butters brightens up]
75,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
76,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls"
77,6,1,Eric Cartman,[slowing] and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
78,6,1,Butters Stotch,[beaming] Wow.
79,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding."
80,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée","I love you too, Jared. You've changed my whole life.
Her name is Jonez, Christine Jonez
She lost forty pounds when she met Jared-"
81,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something."
82,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée","Jared, what's this all about?"
83,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Uh, Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides."
84,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée",What?!
85,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together. [Christine's jaw drops] What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed?"
86,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée",Am I bummed?! [moves her chair away from Jared and faces him] You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?!
87,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Well of course I knew it.
88,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée",Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?!
89,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
90,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée",Not that big of a deal?! I slept with you!
91,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Aren't you overreacting a little bit?
92,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée","Well, Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married!"
93,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're my aides now, but after we get married... they'll be our aides [Christine sobs] You'll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, they'll have aides. It'll make things so simple! [Christine throws up her arms, rises from her chair, and runs out of the restaurant sobbing] Christine! [rises and moves to follow Christine, but stops to think] Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth."
94,6,1,Chef,"Hello there, children."
95,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast."
96,6,1,Chef,Fifty pounds? Why?
97,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Uuuh, school project."
98,6,1,Chef,"Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him."
99,6,1,Stan Marsh,Marry him?
100,6,1,Chef,It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
101,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!"
102,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters."
103,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[self-conscious] Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?"
104,6,1,Chef,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. [all of them move away from the counter and towards the back]"
105,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Ugh. [sets his plate down] Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more."
106,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. [scoops out a tablespoon and hands it to Butters, but Butters doesn't take it. Chef enters and Butters begins to throw up]"
107,6,1,Stan Marsh,"[notices] Chef, we need more food."
108,6,1,Chef,"I'm runnin' out, children. [leaves. Butters vomits some more]"
109,6,1,Eric Cartman,Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
110,6,1,Stan Marsh,"[soberly] Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed."
111,6,1,Eric Cartman,So how long until we can joke about it?
112,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
113,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Wugh, that's a long time to wait."
114,6,1,Butters Stotch,Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
115,6,1,Eric Cartman,Then eat your puke.
116,6,1,Butters Stotch,No!
117,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. [Butters looks at Cartman, then at his puke. Reluctantly he scoops it up and eats it.]"
118,6,1,Subway Representative,"Ladies and gentlemen, we at Subway are happy to inform you that Jared has elected to stay in South Park in order to speak to you once again! [the crowd oohs and aaha]"
119,6,1,Man 1,He's going to speak with us once again!
120,6,1,Subway Representative,"So, here he is, Jared! [the crowd cheers, and Jared is again walking towards them, grinning]"
121,6,1,Subway Singer,"He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time... [Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]"
122,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway's is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight!"
123,6,1,Subway Representative,All right! [pumps his arm as the crowd reacts]
124,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","But, [the crowd quiets down] I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't just Subway sandwiches that made me thin."
125,6,1,Subway Representative,...Huh?
126,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides. [grins with relief. The rep's jaw drops.]
127,6,1,Man 2,Huh?
128,6,1,Man 3,What?
129,6,1,Man 4,Did he say AIDS?
130,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides! [the crowd immediately begins to disperse]"
131,6,1,Man 2,Oh my God!
132,6,1,A woman,Is he serious?
133,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible! [the rep, looking on in dismay, has had enough and pushes Jared out of the way to take the mic]"
134,6,1,Subway Representative,"Uh, the opinions expressed by Mr. Vogle are not necessarily those of the Subway Company. [Jared soothes his left arm a bit]"
135,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! He looks great!
136,6,1,Stan Marsh,"How do you feel, Butters?"
137,6,1,Butters Stotch,"W-well, k-kinda like Cartman. [Cartman slaps Butters and shakes him] Aw!"
138,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself, man!"
139,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Alright, now it's time for phase 2."
140,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Welcome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try Shitty Chicken today?
141,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime."
142,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,You want the Shitty Beef?
143,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
144,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Which one? I see two fat friends.
145,6,1,Eric Cartman,[pointing to Butters] The fat one!
146,6,1,Stan Marsh,"We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world."
147,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,...Why?
148,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
149,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Oh! You mean like-a Jared?!
150,6,1,Eric Cartman,Just like Jared.
151,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"His name is Jared, he lose some weight. Shitty Wok food sure is great. Yeah, okay. That sound good. Saw if he lose weight eating Shitty Wok, I pay use to use him in commercial."
152,6,1,The Boys,All right!
153,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Sir, we are in business!"
154,6,1,Subway Representative,"[second from left] Jared, first of all we want to say that all of us here at Subway appreciate everything you've done for our company."
155,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","[happily] Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me."
156,6,1,Subway Rep 2,"[second from right] Yes, well, it is now the opinion of all of us that perhaps it would be best for you to take your... strange theories on weight loss elsewhere."
157,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",[crestfallen] ...'Scuse me... am I being fired?
158,6,1,Subway Rep 3,"[center] Jared, it's just that your new take on weight loss is contrary to our commitment to good health."
159,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",How so?
160,6,1,Subway Representative,"Well, your new slogan, for instance. [clears his throat] ""When it comes to fitness, Subway goes hand in hand with aides."""
161,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","[softly] Ah-hah. [he rises and leaves the ""SANDWICH MARKETING"" building with hands in pockets. He closes the door and walks away dejectedly. He passes a basketball court where a few people are shooting baskets. He looks at them as he passes by. Then he stops, looks at the camera, sighs, and ]"
162,6,1,Subway Singer,"His name is Jared. Jared lost weight eating Subway, now he's cold and alone and with no place to call his home. He liked sandwiches with Philadelphia cream cheese."
163,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[heard from the outside] Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again! [the camera goes inside. People are exercising on all sorts of equipment. A woman runs by on a track on the second floor. Butters is pulling at a rowing machine as Cartman spots him. Cartman is eating Cheesy Poofs and barking orders] You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!"
164,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[looks at Cartman] Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat."
165,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[normal] Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here."
166,6,1,Butters Stotch,Well alright then.
167,6,1,Eric Cartman,[barking] Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
168,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides! [his aides come in]
169,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler","Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that?"
170,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while."
171,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler","Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you."
172,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler",Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides.
173,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",[brightening] Wait a minute... you're right! [moves towards the camera] Yeah! I think I know how to be a celebrity again! [heads for the door]
174,6,1,Stan Marsh,Did you bring the camera?
175,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we're all set."
176,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[steps in between them] Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business."
177,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what do you mean?"
178,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several."
179,6,1,Stan Marsh,That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
180,6,1,Eric Cartman,I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
181,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! [he and Stan are awed]
182,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea."
183,6,1,Butters Stotch,[arrives as Cartman speaks] Hey fellas.
184,6,1,Stan Marsh,Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
185,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you're still fat!"
186,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it."
187,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!"
188,6,1,Butters Stotch,Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
189,6,1,Eric Cartman,"No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!"
190,6,1,Stan Marsh,[Kyle finally produces the camera] Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
191,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know..."
192,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why are you doing this to us?!
193,6,1,Stan Marsh,All prepared for liposuction surgery?
194,6,1,Eric Cartman,Check.
195,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh, I don't know about this, fellas."
196,6,1,Stan Marsh,"[shoots back] Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. [Cartman makes sure the scalpel is sharp]"
197,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[faces Stan] Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip."
198,6,1,Eric Cartman,That should blah [babbles a bit] ah- here. [cuts into Butters' abdomen]
199,6,1,Butters Stotch,[reacts] Woahhh!
200,6,1,Eric Cartman,Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
201,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. [Cartman picks up one end of the tube and inserts it into the incision]"
202,6,1,Eric Cartman,Alrighty.
203,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy."
204,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I think it's in. [turns around]"
205,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. [Cartman stalls, then picks up the other end and starts sucking the fat out]"
206,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[spits out the hose as soon as the fat hits his lips] Bohogh, egh. [puts the hose into the pail for the fat to collect]"
207,6,1,Butters Stotch,Waaaahh!
208,6,1,Eric Cartman,There it goes.
209,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, it's working!"
210,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[wipes away a bit of fat remaining on his lips] Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes."
211,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good."
212,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault."
213,6,1,Butters Stotch,Everything's getting dark...
214,6,1,Stan Marsh,We've gotta hurry this up. [moves behind the coffee table to Butter's belly and starts pounding on it. The fat begins flowing out faster]
215,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[looks at the fat flowing out] Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good."
216,6,1,Stan Marsh,He's losing weight. [Kyle smiles]
217,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, whoa. Whoa! [the fat rushes out so quickly the tube begins to buck, splattering fat and blood all over the place]"
218,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's out of control! [Stan has stopped pounding, but the fat is pulsing out and Cartman can't control it.. Butters gets thinner by the second and headed for shock]"
219,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. [the sound of a car pulling up is heard]"
220,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home."
221,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, crap!"
222,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, bail! [the three boys rush out the back door, then the front door opens and Butter's parents walk in. The living room is a mess]"
223,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,Butters? Butters?!
224,6,1,Butters Stotch,[listlessly] Mom. Dad.
225,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!
226,6,1,Butters Stotch,Yes sir.
227,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
228,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Four times, mom."
229,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!"
230,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Yes, sir. [rises and... struggles. He falls off the coffee table to the floor. Stephen isn't fazed, but Linda is affected]"
231,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!"
232,6,1,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in."
233,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Ladies and gentlemen, a-at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation!"
234,6,1,Jimbo Kern,What?!
235,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides! [a long silence follows as the audience just looks at Jared]
236,6,1,Mayor McDaniels,This guy's insane.
237,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","But I won't stop there. I'm gonna seek out all the underprivileged and hungry children of the world, and I'm going to give them aides myself!"
238,6,1,Chef,You're gonna give children AIDS?!
239,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful child on this earth has aides by next month! Aides for everyone! [another long silence]"
240,6,1,Skeeter,Get him! [the crowd begins to move forward angrily and Jared leaved the podium]
241,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Butters. Time to go."
242,6,1,Butters Stotch,Uh- go where?
243,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
244,6,1,Butters Stotch,"I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. [lifts his shorts to show the bandage over the scar]"
245,6,1,Stan Marsh,What?
246,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days."
247,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!"
248,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[counts off] Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?! [moves his hands palms down to wash his hands of any more trouble] Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!"
249,6,1,Stan Marsh,...Kenny would have done it.
250,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yep.
251,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was? [whispers] God. [normally] He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever."
252,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!"
253,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you."
254,6,1,Butters Stotch,No- but you don't sound like me.
255,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[begins sounding something like Butters. Kyle looks on] Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money."
256,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that was pretty good."
257,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. [pulls Butters out the door. Cartman enters the house]"
258,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! [the others leave and he closes the door]"
259,6,1,Eric Cartman,Eh. [makes himself comfortable on the sofa and turns on the TV. He grunts a bit] Eh. Yeah. [the phone rings; he answers] Well hello?
260,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"[at an office full of cubicles] I'm just checking in on you, Butters. [a woman walks down the aisle behind him] Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!"
261,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it."

[the camera pulls back and the thing Jared is beating is a dead horse. Literally] What's wrong with [paf] aides?! Why doesn't anyone want me to give them [paf] aides?! [the crowd arrives with torches, charging noisily]"
269,6,1,Herbert Garrison,"There he is, beatin' that dead horse!"
270,6,1,Man in Crowd,Alright!
271,6,1,Jimbo Kern,Let's get him! [the crowd charges forward and Jared runs away again]

329,6,1,Stan Marsh,[takes off his hat and throws it on the ground] Oh God-damnit!
330,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, just forget the whole thing then!"
331,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay. [walks off, returns] Hey, you kids know why chicken cross the road?"

333,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,'Cause it has AIDS. [laughs. The boys just look at him oddly] AIDS so funny! [walks away laughing]
334,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, so much for our money."
335,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams."
336,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded. [gasps] Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! [rushes away]"
337,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Huh. Huh, uh, uh."
338,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[opens the door in anticipation] There you are, Butters!"

341,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?"
342,6,1,Eric Cartman,"No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!"
343,6,1,Butters Stotch,Hu-oh! Goody!
344,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Here you go. [hands Butters some drawings] I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat."
345,6,1,Butters Stotch,Uh- perfect.
346,6,1,Eric Cartman,Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. [makes his way to the door]
347,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh hey, uh Eric? [Cartman turns around] Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal."
348,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Butters, it was my pleasure. [pulls out his mittens and opens the door, then puts them on. He heads for the sidewalk humming a late night theme song, then turns around to frame the house with his fingers, then walks away]"
349,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Hi, Mom and Dad!"
350,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"DON'T YOU HI MOM AND DAD US YOU LITTLE PUNK!!! ""(Punch)"""
351,6,1,Butters Stotch,Ow! Dad?

356,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now."
