0,6,12,Lolly,"[notices the kids and straightens up] Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's Candy Shop."
1,6,12,Stan Marsh,We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
2,6,12,Lolly,Oh that's great!
3,6,12,Eric Cartman,You bet your fat clown ass it is!
4,6,12,Lolly,Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub.
5,6,12,Eric Cartman,[the boys' jaws drop a bit] ...ticket stub?
6,6,12,Lolly,You know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket. [display the store's half of the ticket]
7,6,12,Stan Marsh,Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
8,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,It was such a long time ago!
9,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we?"
10,6,12,Lolly,Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners?
11,6,12,Stan Marsh,Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
12,6,12,Lolly,"Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called ""The Ticking Clock."" Works great in the movies. [steps backwards into the store and closes the door. The boys look at the door for a few seconds, then Cartman turns and steps forward]"
13,6,12,Eric Cartman,[drops the buckets] GODDAMMIT!!!
14,6,12,Stan Marsh,We've gotta find that ticket!
15,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember."
16,6,12,Eric Cartman,"You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. [Zoom in on Cartman, who starts remembering...]"
17,6,12,Lolly,[hands a ticket stub to Stan] All right. There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. You'll need it to claim your prize. [looks at the rest of the store] Sign up for the five-minute shopping spree!! [walks off]
18,6,12,Stan Marsh,"[hands the stub to Cartman] You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it."
19,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle."
20,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [hands the stub to Kenny]"
21,6,12,Kenny,(Okay.) [takes it and pockets it]
22,6,12,Eric Cartman,[bolts away] Kenny!!!
23,6,12,Stan Marsh,[following quickly] AAAHHH!! [the buckets stay on the ground and the boys rush to Kenny's house]
24,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,[following quickly] AAAHHH!! [the buckets stay on the ground and the boys rush to Kenny's house]
25,6,12,Stuart McCormick,[opens the door] Yes?
26,6,12,Stan Marsh,Where's Kenny??
27,6,12,Stuart McCormick,Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
28,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??"
29,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"His body? Well, why??"
30,6,12,Eric Cartman,Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
31,6,12,Stan Marsh,"[shuts Cartman up quick and stumbles for words] Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure."
32,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Closure.
33,6,12,Eric Cartman,[muffled] What the fuck is closure?!
34,6,12,Kenny s Mom,Oh all right boys. Come on in. [the boys follow the McCormicks in]
35,6,12,Stuart McCormick,"We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him."
36,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny. [an urn is shown, with pictures of Kenny on either side of it.]"
37,6,12,Eric Cartman,You turned him into a teapot?
38,6,12,Stuart McCormick,"No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it."
39,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"Your friends are here to see you, Kenny. [picks up the urn and caresses it.] They miss you an awful lot, like we all do. [starts crying]"
40,6,12,Stuart McCormick,"Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us. [turns to his wife and consoles her] Aw now, honey. [joins her in sobbing]"
41,6,12,Eric Cartman,Wewewewewewe...
42,6,12,Stan Marsh,[climbs up to the window and looks in] Did you get it? [Kyle climbs up next to him]
43,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards. [resumes the detection] Wewewewewewe..."
44,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! [Cartman looks back at the boys angrily, gets Kenny's urn, and climbs back out the window. Seconds later, a robot guard does indeed move through the living room...]"
45,6,12,Robot Guard,Wewewewewewe...
46,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, we made it!"
47,6,12,Stan Marsh,Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
48,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Let him out, Cartman! [Cartman opens the urn and the boys duck]"
49,6,12,Eric Cartman,...Kenny? [the boys lose their fear and rise up to look at the urn] Kenny?!
50,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Is he in there?
51,6,12,Stan Marsh,I can't see. [Cartman pours out the ashes and the boys sneeze from the fine powder until it dissipates. Some ash smudges remain on their faces.]
52,6,12,Eric Cartman,What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
53,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! [Cartman samples the ashes]
54,6,12,Stan Marsh,It was a trick!
55,6,12,Eric Cartman,God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
56,6,12,Stan Marsh,Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
57,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
58,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!"
59,6,12,Stan Marsh,We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! [gets off his stool and walks away.]
60,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit! There has to be a way! [leaves his stool and follows Kyle out. Cartman looks at the ashes, then thinks of something]"
61,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Hmmm. [leaves his stool and returns with some milk, a glass, and a spoon. He scoops up some ashes and drops them into the glass. He pours the milk onto the ashes, stirs them up, and drinks the milk ] Hmm, not bad. [scoops some more ashes into the milk]"
62,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! [the dream ends abruptly]"
63,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[sits up, eyes wide open] Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. [growls a bit, turns to sleep, and farts. The door flies open and Stan and Kyle rush in]"
64,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, come on!"
65,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[sits up again] What what? [sees who it is] Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!"
66,6,12,Stan Marsh,Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
67,6,12,Eric Cartman,How?
68,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"A ladder to heaven. [unfolds some blueprints] We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny."
69,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor."
70,6,12,Stan Marsh,"[going for some more wood] We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven."
71,6,12,Randy Marsh,"A ladder to heaven? Why, son?"
72,6,12,Stan Marsh,Because we wanna see Kenny again. [heaves a piece of wood back to the tower]
73,6,12,Sharon Marsh,"[after a moment of though] Oh... oh, that's so sweet."
74,6,12,Randy Marsh,That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
75,6,12,Jimbo Kern,"[approaching] Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh... [sees the boys' activity] What the hell are they doing?"
76,6,12,Randy Marsh,"The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven."
77,6,12,Jimbo Kern,Awwww.
78,6,12,Sheila Broflovski,"[arriving with Gerald] Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough."
79,6,12,Randy Marsh,"No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny."
80,6,12,Jimbo Kern,A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God. [begins to sob]
81,6,12,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, that's so touching. [begins to sob. All the adults begin to cry. The boys continue building]"
82,6,12,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to- [chokes as the camera reaches the tower, then gathers himself] a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again. [sighs] It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say."
83,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work... [begins to break down] if he... built the ladder to heaven."
84,6,12,Sheila Broflovski,"[sobbing] They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!"
85,6,12,Jimbo Kern,"[wistful] It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. [starts sobbing. Other people are show crying: Marietta Kitchin, Carrie Ayers & Steve Stegman]"
86,6,12,Mr Garrison,A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.
87,6,12,Mayor McDaniels,[sobbing with her aides] These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
88,6,12,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, people from all over the- [chokes] Sorry. [gets back on track] People from all over the country are coming to see the ladder, feeling a connection to its symbolism, and beauty. Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder. [camera pulls back to show Jackson to the reporter's left, strumming a guitar] Alan Jackson is, of course, the man who wrote the song, ""Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning,"" about the tragedies on September 11. And now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions. Let's listen in. [focus shifts to Jackson]"
89,6,12,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when they built the ladder to heaven? 
Did it make you feel like cryin', or did you think it was kind of gay?"
90,6,12,Townsman,What a beautiful song. [the boys look down at Jackson]
91,6,12,Alan Jackson,"Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11
[the townsfolk begin to cry]
I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___
Eleven.

Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here! [the crowd rushes in to get copies of the CD. Jackson is pleased at the interest. The boys resume their construction. Stan and Kyle are hammering away at the top of the ladder. Cartman hustles up the ladder with a car seat]"
92,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
93,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. [hands it to the other two boys, who put it in place]"
94,6,12,Stan Marsh,Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
95,6,12,Eric Cartman,...No. [the boys let the seat drop] Ey! Euuugh.
96,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! [the dream ends abruptly]"
97,6,12,Stuart McCormick,"Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys? [shows Kenny a centerfold, which shows a circle where the centerfold's crotch should be. He lifts the centerfold high enough to look through the hole] Kenny?! Answer me!! [back to the present - Cartman looks dazed]"
98,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman? Cartman?!
99,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[startled] Wha-uh, what?? What?"
100,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!"
101,6,12,Eric Cartman,I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
102,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe you got brain cancer.
103,6,12,Eric Cartman,Do you think?
104,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!"
105,6,12,SNN Reporter,"The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend. [a picture of the boys on the ladder is shown] It's making Americans start to believe in heaven, again. [next segment has the reporter out on the street]"
106,6,12,Woman 1,"Well when I see how this ladder has brought people together, how... how it has changed America, I mean, how can I not believe?"
107,6,12,SNN Reporter,[off screen] Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder to heaven?
108,6,12,Fat Man,"If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy, and the ladder is my penis... [the camera moves away quickly, but the man keeps up] and the pearly gates are the- [static... the camera pulls back to show the reporter back at the desk, holding a TV status pattern on paper and hissing. He notices the camera and stops, putting the pattern down]"
109,6,12,SNN Reporter,"Uh, meanwhile, the American economy cont- [gets some breaking news over his headset] wait. Wait. Wait a minute. We are getting reports now that Japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the US's. Let's go live to SNN correspondent Nobuhiro Sabasurisurijuwa."
110,6,12,"Nobunaga Hiroichi, SNN Japanese Correspondent","This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben. [the tower is shown with klieg lights bathing it in light] Ahready, the Japanese radder extend faaar into space [the ladder is now high enough for a space shuttle to park by and astronauts come out to work on it] and it's growing by a-one thousand miles every day. [back on the ground...] As the endeavor continues it is becoming clear that Japan will reach a-hayben before the United States. [a raspberry follows]"
111,6,12,Neighbors,Nahurabo Nahurabo
112,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Excuse me. [""Nahurabo""] Excuse me! [""Nahurabo""] Uh, we ran out of stuff. [the singing abruptly stops] We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with."
113,6,12,Man 1,Oh no!
114,6,12,Woman 2,"Oh Jesus, no!"
115,6,12,Alan Jackson,Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven?
116,6,12,Stan Marsh,"We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood."
117,6,12,Randy Marsh,"[raises his arms high] No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough."
118,6,12,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. [a truck is heard arriving]"
119,6,12,Man 2,"[at the back, by the fence] Wait! Look! [a fleet of trucks, cars, and jeeps converge on the road outside the house]"
120,6,12,General,"We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys! [behind him, military personnel bring out ladders and other construction equipment] There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today! [the crowd cheers wildly. The boys' parents are dumbstruck] Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon! [the teams set about their duties]"
121,6,12,Soldiers,Yes sir!
122,6,12,Alan Jackson,Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?
123,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[with Cartman at the top of the ladder] Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back."
124,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle."
125,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Do you see anything?
126,6,12,Stan Marsh,No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
127,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Grandma??
128,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[joins the other two boys, grunting as he gets into position] Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!"
129,6,12,Stan Marsh,"No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off."
130,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough."
131,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
132,6,12,Eric Cartman,Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
133,6,12,Stan Marsh,What??
134,6,12,Eric Cartman,"You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O."
135,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,[processes the comment] What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
136,6,12,Eric Cartman,Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
137,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
138,6,12,Eric Cartman,Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
139,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,HAAHH!!! [smacks Cartman on the side of the face with his left fist]
140,6,12,Eric Cartman,"AH! [stunned, he has another flashback. A heartbeat is heard]"
141,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Kenny.
142,6,12,Stan Marsh,Hey Kenny.
143,6,12,Kenny,(We can watch it at my house.)
144,6,12,Eric Cartman,"In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto"
145,6,12,Kenny,"[points an accusing finger at Cartman] (Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)"
146,6,12,Eric Cartman,What did you say?!
147,6,12,Kenny,"(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)"
148,6,12,Eric Cartman,What did you say?!
149,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[in the present] I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!"" [opens his eyes and looks around] Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?"
150,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??"
151,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes."
152,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,You're too fat to be Kenny.
153,6,12,Eric Cartman,[amid his thoughts] You're a- stupid Jew.
154,6,12,Stan Marsh,Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
155,6,12,George W. Bush,"Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese."
156,6,12,General,"Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein."
157,6,12,George W. Bush,Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago!
158,6,12,General,Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.
159,6,12,George W. Bush,"Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop!"
160,6,12,General,"[flips a page on an easel, showing another page with three identical photos] These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven. [points out an encircled object in the center photo] Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here [points out an encircled object in the lower photo] we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons."
161,6,12,Dick Cheney,That... kinda looks like a seagull.
162,6,12,General,Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.
163,6,12,George W. Bush,That tricky bastard!
164,6,12,General,"Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must... [close-up] bomb heaven!"
165,6,12,SNN Reporter,"SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans believe in heaven, should we bomb it? The polls right now show that 51% of Americans think Saddam has to be dealt with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies."
166,6,12,War Protester,"[in tie-dye shirt, waving a ""No War On Heaven"" sign] War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!"
167,6,12,Redneck,"[with baby dangling from the left hand, rifle firmly in the right hand] We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves."
168,6,12,Fat Man,"I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States... [the mic is retracted] then there would- [the cameraman tries to avoid the man, but nope] hard nipples!"
169,6,12,SNN Reporter,[back in the newsroom] God-damnit! [holds up the snow pattern and hisses]
170,6,12,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action."
171,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but..."
172,6,12,Gerald Broflovski,But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
173,6,12,Stan Marsh,"No, we have to see Kenny!"
174,6,12,Sharon Marsh,You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.
175,6,12,Stan Marsh,Cremated? What's that?
176,6,12,Randy Marsh,"When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. [the boys are alarmed]"
177,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What?? For God's sake, why??"
178,6,12,Sheila Broflovski,"[half-annoyed] Kyle, it's just what some people do."
179,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Are you gonna burn me?
180,6,12,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, that's not the issue right now."
181,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ!
182,6,12,Randy Marsh,"The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is."
183,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"You see boys, Kenny is in here. [opens the urn and pours out the contents, which are white now. Mrs. McCormick notices] What the??? [looks inside the urn] Wait a minute! This is kitty litter!"
184,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[resigned, comes clean] Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter."
185,6,12,Stuart McCormick,You WHAT??
186,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!"
187,6,12,Eric Cartman,[knowingly] Shut up!
188,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"You did, dude! You drank his whole body!"
189,6,12,Eric Cartman,[knowingly] Shut up!
190,6,12,Kenny s Mom,Oh my God! This is awful! [starts moving away. The other adults follow] And disgusting!
191,6,12,Liane Cartman,"[stops and looks at Cartman] Bad, Eric, bad! [moves away]"
192,6,12,Eric Cartman,That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
193,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! [leaves the table]"
194,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Good job, fatass! [leaves the table]"
195,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body."
196,6,12,Eric Cartman,Looks like I've come to the right place.
197,6,12,Unplanned Parenthood Nurse,Can I help you?
198,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please."
199,6,12,Unplanned Parenthood Nurse,You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
200,6,12,Eric Cartman,Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! [a woman and her boyfriend enter the clinic. The woman sobs]
201,6,12,Boyfriend,"It's gonna be okay, babe."
202,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me! [the woman can't believe what she's hearing] I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!"
203,6,12,Woman,"Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! [walks away from the clinic]"
204,6,12,Steven,"Damnit! Damnit! [turns and walks off, then looks back in] Thanks a lot, kid! [throws a rock at Cartman]"
205,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Eh! [becomes catatonic once more, and another flashback comes]"
206,6,12,Eric Cartman,[Kenny! Kenny! kenny...
207,6,12,Stan Marsh,[Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree! [the last few words echo a few times]
208,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,[We're all gonna pitch in on an entry! [the last few words echo a few times. Fast forward to the day the boys are at Lolly's]
209,6,12,Lolly,[Alright! [rips a ticket in half and hands the stub to Stan] There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. [the last few words echo a few times. He gives the ticket to Stan and walks off]
210,6,12,Stan Marsh,"[[hands the stub to Cartman] Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. [the last few words echo a few times]"
211,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle..."
212,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [the last word echoes a few times. He hands the stub to Kenny]"
213,6,12,Kenny,"[(Okay!) [the word echoes a few times. He takes it and pockets it. Fast forward to some time later, on the sidewalk]"
214,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts! [fast forward to Kenny's room. He walks to a locked box by the window while looking at the ticket stub. He unlocks it, puts the ticket in, and locks the box again.]"
215,6,12,Eric Cartman,The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere! [walks up to a couple filling out paperwork] Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God! [heads out the door] You guys! YOU GUYS!!
216,6,12,George W. Bush,"Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction. [shows a picture of the ladder and another one of the clouds. Both pictures have areas circled in] We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But he has not ""re-spond-ed""."
217,6,12,Indian Ambassador,"Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD!"
218,6,12,George W. Bush,"Right. Dead, and in heaven."
219,6,12,Another Ambassador,"This is preposterous! Even if there was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there?"
220,6,12,George W. Bush,"Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him about August. [the French Ambassador has tuned out] When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan's new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment. [the assembly is overcome with silence] Question? [more silence. An ambassador raises his hand] Yes?"
221,6,12,Another Ambassador,"Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?"
222,6,12,George W. Bush,"I assure you, I am not high."
223,6,12,Eric Cartman,You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! [Stan and Kyle rise and line up on either side of Cartman]
224,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What do you mean, fatass?"
225,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere."
226,6,12,Stan Marsh,Where??
227,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic [Kyle looks down at the lumber, then looks at the pile behind him] and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box. [Kyle fishes around for a small solid piece of lumber, then finds one and aims it at Cartman's head] I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken- [thunk] AY! [is dazed for a bit, then recovers none too pleased, then glares at Kyle]"
228,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Do you see anything?
229,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! [starts at Kyle, but Stan holds him back]"
230,6,12,Stan Marsh,Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
231,6,12,Eric Cartman,Not by giving me brain damage!
232,6,12,Stan Marsh,Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
233,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[stares at Stan, then resigns to his former position] Alright, go ahead. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!... no. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!..."
234,6,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!"
235,6,12,Randy Marsh,What? [follows the ladies out with Gerald]
236,6,12,Sharon Marsh,See for yourself!
237,6,12,"Nobunaga Hiroichi, SNN Japanese Correspondent","This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben. [behind him is a set with clouds hanging from wires. Angels swing into place slowly] The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh. [one of the angels falls off her rope and hits the ground. The correspondent sees this and moves in front of her to block the shot. Someone enters the shot and plants a Japanese flag among the clouds] Therefore, hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu."
238,6,12,Natsako Semu,"Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy."
239,6,12,"Nobunaga Hiroichi, SNN Japanese Correspondent","[fairly gloating] That's the news from heben. [the set creaks behind him and falls down, showing the studio.] Dame! Dame da! Bakayarou da!! [""No good! It's no good! Idiots!""]"
240,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven."
241,6,12,Gerald Broflovski,Kids!
242,6,12,George W. Bush,Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.
243,6,12,Sharon Marsh,"Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?"
244,6,12,Randy Marsh,"If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. [behind the crowd Cartman, Stan and Kyle return with buckets of candy. That conking finally worked]"
245,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. [everyone turns to look at the boys]"
246,6,12,Some Guy,Dude.
247,6,12,George W. Bush,Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs.
248,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home."
249,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??"
250,6,12,Eric Cartman,"...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before."
251,6,12,Channel 4 Field Reporter,But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?
252,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels..."
253,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now."
254,6,12,General,"So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!"
255,6,12,Johnson,Sir!
256,6,12,Randy Marsh,"No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it."
257,6,12,Crowd,Awwww. [the crowd begins to disperse and people begin to cry in appreciation]
258,6,12,George W. Bush,[moving off with his staff] And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs.
259,6,12,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there? [walks up to the boys] You little bastards ruined my latest song! [drives his guitar into the snow, breaking it, then walks away]"
260,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy."
261,6,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
262,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[chuckles] No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick! [looks stunned] ...Oh Jesus Christ."
263,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa. [shakes Cartman around] Kenny, you in there?"
264,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! [runs off]"
265,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, come back here! [chases after Cartman]"
266,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Stop him, Kenny! [follows them off. The camera suddenly pans up]"
267,6,12,Saddam Hussein,Keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come on!
268,6,12,God,"[a bright beam of light lands on Saddam, who shields his eyes] Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here."
269,6,12,Saddam Hussein,"Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This is a chocolate chip factory. See? [displays boxes of ""Saddam's Heavenly Chocolate Chips""]"
270,6,12,God,It looks like a chemical weapons plant.
271,6,12,Saddam Hussein,"Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't make it look like a chemical weapons plant, would I? I'd make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something."
272,6,12,God,"...Alright, just checking. [removes the beam of light]"
273,6,12,Saddam Hussein,[giggles] Stupid asshole! [goes back to work]
