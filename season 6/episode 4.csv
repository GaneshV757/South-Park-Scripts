0,6,4,Ms Choksondik,"Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher."
1,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob."
2,6,4,Ms Choksondik,Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.
3,6,4,Kids,"Hi, Rancher Bob."
4,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.
5,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,[to Stan] City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
6,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death. [a shot of the cows looking back at the class.]"
7,6,4,Eric Cartman,They look so delicious. [Kyle looks at him]
8,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"[leading the class down a line of cows] Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers. [a cow moos and a guillotine comes down, chopping its head off.]"
9,6,4,Kids,Eewwww!!
10,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, dude. [Two workers come and carry the cow's body away, leaving the head behind. Rancher Bob reaches down for a skinned leg and holds it up]"
11,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Hey, anybody want a free sample?"
12,6,4,Eric Cartman,[raises his arm up with glee] Memememee!
13,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"[now standing next to a darkened doorway] And in here, boys and girls, we have our... [flips on a switch, illuminating the room beyond.] veal ranch. [the class looks at the baby calves in the room. A closeup changes the music from spritely to somber. A shot of the class, with some kids showing some dread. Bob walks over to a calf and kneels by it] You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal."
14,6,4,Stan Marsh,Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
15,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,Yeppir.
16,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??"
17,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Well, if we called it ""little baby cow"" people might not eat it."
18,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wouldn't have."
19,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Huh, me neither."
20,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man, look at that one! [moves towards the calves] It looks delicious."
21,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,What??
22,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Mm, succulent and juicy. [reaches the calf he was eyeing] Can we have a free sample of these, too?"
23,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store."
24,6,4,Eric Cartman,Alriiight!
25,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Tomorrow morning? [a shot of the calves has Stan, Kyle, and Butters transfixed. The rest of the class leaves] Dude, we gotta help them."
26,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
27,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[knocks twice on the wall below the window] Pst, Cartman."
28,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[responding to a dream] No, Uncle Jesse, no!"
29,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[knocks twice while saying] Cartman, wake up!"
30,6,4,Eric Cartman,[wakes up and sees his friends] What? What the hell are you guys doing??
31,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[opening the window] Come on, we've gotta go!"
32,6,4,Eric Cartman,Where are we going?
33,6,4,Stan Marsh,"We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!"
34,6,4,Eric Cartman,What? Why?
35,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!"
36,6,4,Eric Cartman,So?
37,6,4,Stan Marsh,"So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!"
38,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass,"" ""butthole,"" and ""douchebag."" I really don't feel like you guys's friend. [lies back down and closes his eyes]"
39,6,4,Stan Marsh,"We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together."
40,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the ""Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."""
41,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[heaves softly] Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!"
42,6,4,Eric Cartman,[sits up] Oho! So you need me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
43,6,4,Stan Marsh,[plainly] Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
44,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. [turns his ass to Kyle, lowers his pants and underwear, and waits]"
45,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
46,6,4,Eric Cartman,Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
47,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Screw you, Cartman!"
48,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss. [softly] Kiss it."
49,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Go on, dude it's the only way."
50,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,No!
51,6,4,Eric Cartman,Kiss it. Come on. [gruffly] Kiss it.
52,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Just do it really fast, and we can go."
53,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Have Butters kiss it.
54,6,4,Eric Cartman,"No, it has to be Kyle. [turns away. Kyle resists for a few moments, then slowly moves his face towards Cartman's ass through the window. Kyle finally reaches the ass and Cartman unleashes a juicy fart. Kyle withdraws in fits and starts]"
55,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Awww! [wipes off his face and then waves away the smell]
56,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[laughs uproariously] Oh man, that was soho awesome!"
57,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Sick! I felt it on my face!
58,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!"
59,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Hell, I'm not goin' with you! [lies back down and closes his eyes again]"
60,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hyaaaa! [lunges at Cartman and starts hitting him]
61,6,4,Eric Cartman,Heeeey! [rolls off the bed and the wrestling continues]
62,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: ""Not for actual breaking and entering. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."""
63,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too! [holds up parts of a torch] How does this thing work, Cartman?"
64,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[heaves and takes the torch from Stan] Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask [hands it to Stan] and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. [opens the gas valve and lights the gas stream. A blue flame shoots out and the other boys jump back.]"
65,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[softly into his headset] Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta."
66,6,4,Eric Cartman,[peers down. Butters and Kyle join him] You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
67,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[looks up and calls out] I said that's far enough! [the harness drops to the floor. He gets up and unlocks himself out of the harness, and it goes back up. A calf looks back at him innocently. Stan moves up behind the calf, the softly] Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose. [removes the chain] There you go. You're free. Run away! [the calf doesn't move, and Stan gestures] Go! They're gonna murder you."
68,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off."
69,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,You need to freeze some of your ass off.
70,6,4,Eric Cartman,"O! At least I have an ass, Jew!"
71,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What? [below, Stan removes the chains from the remaining calves]"
72,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you stupid baby cows! [walks towards the door and lifts up the security bar, then opens the door] You have to get out of here. [they just lift their heads and look at the entrance. The other boys join Stan inside the veal ranch]"
73,6,4,Butters Stotch,Huuh what's the matter?
74,6,4,Stan Marsh,They aren't leaving.
75,6,4,Eric Cartman,See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
76,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
77,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah, they're too weak to move. [a shot of the calves again] Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back."
78,6,4,Butters Stotch,No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
79,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house."
80,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
81,6,4,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
82,6,4,Eric Cartman,"I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood."
83,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!"
84,6,4,Butters Stotch,Eh yeah I do too!
85,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[moves towards the calves] We're just gonna have to carry them one by one. [lifts up his first calf] Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Butters look at each other, then move to join Stan]"
86,6,4,Eric Cartman,Eh! [follows]
87,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. [pushes the calf further across the ice]"
88,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer."
89,6,4,Stan Marsh,We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
90,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Butters had that at his house?
91,6,4,Butters Stotch,[enters carrying a box] Hey fellas!
92,6,4,Stan Marsh,Butters! [Butters turns] Did you bring it?
93,6,4,Butters Stotch,I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
94,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,All right!
95,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[reads the box] ""Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser."""
96,6,4,Stan Marsh,What?
97,6,4,Butters Stotch,"""Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"""
98,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?"
99,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works."
100,6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Marsh."
101,6,4,Sharon,Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
102,6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property."
103,6,4,Sharon,Stole? A-a-are you sure? [Randy and Shelly appear next to her]
104,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"I followed a calf-curling trail right to your house, ma'am."
105,6,4,Shelly,"Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom."
106,6,4,Sharon,"Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding. [she leads the others upstairs to Stan's room.] Stanley, did you see-? [she's stunned at what she sees]"
107,6,4,Stan Marsh,Aw crap!
108,6,4,Sharon,"Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?"
109,6,4,Stan Marsh,[points an accusing finger at Rancher Bob and approaches] That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
110,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh","Stanley, they belong to him."
111,6,4,Stan Marsh,"They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die."
112,6,4,Shelly,"Let me hit him, Mom!"
113,6,4,Sharon,"Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and [points at him] you don't have a choice! [Stan looks dejected, then defiant. He closes his door and locks himself in with Cartman, Butters and Kyle. Sharon then pounds on the door and tries to open it] Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!"
114,6,4,Stan Marsh,No!
115,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh","Stan, you're behaving like a kid!"
116,6,4,Stan Marsh,You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the ones who knew we were making little baby animals suffer! [walks off to his right]
117,6,4,Sharon,"Open this door, now!"
118,6,4,Stan Marsh,[pushing his dresser into place against the door] Kiss my ass!
119,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh Jeez, he said ""ass"" to his parents."
120,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You're getting in pretty deep, dude. [Stan glares back with a look of determination]"
121,6,4,Sharon,"I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person."
122,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back."
123,6,4,Sharon,"I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life."
124,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?"
125,6,4,Officer Barbrady,Me?? How did I get into this mess?
126,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,So what happens now?
127,6,4,Stan Marsh,"I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing."
128,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We're with you, dude."
129,6,4,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
130,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[serious] Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now."
131,6,4,Eric Cartman,I want out.
132,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[glares] Shut up, Cartman."
133,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We're with you, Stan."
134,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to."
135,6,4,Stan Marsh,Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
136,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
137,6,4,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
138,6,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Wait-what?
139,6,4,Sharon,"And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing."
140,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!"
141,6,4,Sharon,"Well excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!"
142,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open! [the adults leave the living room and go up the stairs, stopping at Stan's door] Kyle?! [pounds on the door] This is your mother! You will open this door right now!"
143,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,[pause] ...No I won't.
144,6,4,Sharon,"[gets to retort] Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila. [Sheila looks at her] That was very impressive."
145,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"[turns back to the door] Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!"
146,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!"
147,6,4,Sharon,[folds her arms] Very persuasive.
148,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,[starts pounding away furiously at the door] AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!
149,6,4,Chris,"[calms Sheila down and takes over] Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try. [faces the door] Butters? [slight zoom-in on Butters] Butters, this is your father."
150,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[to the boys] Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?"
151,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this."
152,6,4,Chris,Butters? Answer me!
153,6,4,Butters Stotch,[to the boys] But they-ah they're angry at me.
154,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say. [begins to whisper in Butters' ear] You can tell them...
155,6,4,Chris,Butters! Right now!
156,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?"
157,6,4,Chris,WHAT?!
158,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh, sweet Jesus."
159,6,4,Chris,[turns to the other adults] What's gotten into them?
160,6,4,Sharon,"Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!"
161,6,4,Stan Marsh,"This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe."
162,6,4,Sharon,Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizzas and ice cream.
163,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[weakening] Oh, God-damnit you guys."
164,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, stay away from that door!"
165,6,4,Sharon,"You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. [the adults walk away, but Sheila stops and turns back to the door.]"
166,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,[pounds on the door once more] Mmmrragh!!
167,6,4,Stan Marsh,[sighs] Round one is over. We made it. [the boys gather in]
168,6,4,Eric Cartman,"We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!"
169,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in."
170,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"But we will have to sleep, dude."
171,6,4,Stan Marsh,Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
172,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[finding a way to relate] Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!"
173,6,4,Stan Marsh,"We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! [one calf take a dump on the carpet, another walks up and takes a piss on it]"
174,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
175,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!"
176,6,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food."
177,6,4,Sharon,"Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all."
178,6,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, all right."
179,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
180,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Good night, fellas!"
181,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Good night.
182,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[to the calves] Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity."
183,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again."
184,6,4,Eric Cartman,Can't go on. Need... food...
185,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
186,6,4,Eric Cartman,"There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf."
187,6,4,Stan Marsh,"No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!"
188,6,4,Eric Cartman,All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. [points]
189,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks back at Stan] He might be right, dude."
190,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Aw, heck. [a basket floats up to the window on a pole]"
191,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Wait, what is that? [points to the basket. The other three boys turn. Cartman approaches the window and takes the basket] Dude!"
192,6,4,Eric Cartman,Food!
193,6,4,Sharon,"Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?"
194,6,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer."
195,6,4,Sharon,"Oh dear God, you've ruined everything."
196,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,All right!
197,6,4,Stan Marsh,See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
198,6,4,Eric Cartman,Look you guys! Beef jerky!
199,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! And fried chicken! [Stan sits at a corner with his apples.]
200,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[sensing a lapse] Wha? [rises and walks to his bed, where the other boys sit eating]"
201,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Mmmmm.
202,6,4,Eric Cartman,Mmmmm.
203,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are you guys doing?"
204,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We're eating, dude."
205,6,4,Stan Marsh,You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
206,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
207,6,4,Butters Stotch,Me neither.
208,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy."
209,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[returns to his corner] That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!"
210,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Go ahead, that's more for us. [tempts the calf next to him with some beef jerky] You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry? [the calf starts chewing on it] Who's the hungry man?"
211,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks over] Dude, that's messed up. [Stan looks as well, but goes back to his apples]"
212,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, check this out! [a TV now sits where the football normally is, and the picture shown is that of Stan's house. The other boys join Kyle in looking at the news report from News 4]"
213,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where four insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle."
214,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are. [Cartman looks at him, then slugs him hard] Eugh!"
215,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say."
216,6,4,Craig s father,"[with wife and son] We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community. [Craig shows his right middle finger to the camera. Next, the boys' parents are shown]"
217,6,4,Tom,"[with wife and son] We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community. [Craig shows his right middle finger to the camera. Next, the boys' parents are shown]"
218,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh","We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!"
219,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.
220,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas."
221,6,4,Stan Marsh,"No, this is exactly what we wanted."
222,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,It is?
223,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people."
224,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to ""Puppies from Around the World."""
225,6,4,Stan Marsh,[the boys are stunned] ...I don't believe it.
226,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far."
227,6,4,Stan Marsh,[notices the situation] Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! [Butters stirs and turns around]
228,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[waking] Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. [voices are heard outside and the boys sit up, then move towards the window]"
229,6,4,Voices,"We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved"
230,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Huh, what the hell is that?"
231,6,4,Hippies,If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.For a... brighter tomorrow...
232,6,4,Eric Cartman,Hippies!
233,6,4,Stan Marsh,What are they doing here?
234,6,4,Hippie,[on bullhorn] We're with you boys! Your message is real and your voice is just. [the other hippes start cheering]
235,6,4,Hippies,Hooray! Hooray!
236,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
237,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Ew, they're all dirty."
238,6,4,Eric Cartman,"What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!"
239,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict. [FBI vehicles speed in and FBI agents pour out of the vehicles]"
240,6,4,Sharon,[not believing what she sees] Oh Jesus Christ. [slaps her hand to her forehead]
241,6,4,FBI Agent,Who's in charge here?
242,6,4,Officer Barbrady,I am. But I don't want to be.
243,6,4,FBI Agent,Where's the negotiator?
244,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad."
245,6,4,FBI Agent,"All right, see what you can do."
246,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, are you okay?"
247,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. [lifts up his shirt to show the sores to the others]"
248,6,4,Butters Stotch,What is that?
249,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, maybe we should end this."
250,6,4,Stan Marsh,No!
251,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,Give me a hard line to the phone in that house! [a squad member gets on it]
252,6,4,Officer Barbrady,The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out.
253,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"[receives the phone] Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology."
254,6,4,Stan Marsh,Hello?
255,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you?"
256,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Ah, hold on. [turns to the other boys] It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?"
257,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Don't give him anything!
258,6,4,Stan Marsh,What do I say??
259,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Stan and takes over] Dah, give me that! [takes the receiver from Stan] Talk to me Mike."
260,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?"
261,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Sure, sure."
262,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other."
263,6,4,Eric Cartman,What do you have in mind?
264,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Well, how about you send out one of the calves?"
265,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike."
266,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Just one, that's all we want."
267,6,4,Eric Cartman,"All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -"
268,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, no!"
269,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! [Cartman holds out his palm to silence them]
270,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[clears his throat] We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own."
271,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"What? I, I can't do that."
272,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye."
273,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad."
274,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work."
275,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"[trumped] Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do."
276,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,Okay. Up a little... left a little... [a crane lifts a box of ammunition towards Stan's window. Kyle and Butters wait for it] Almost there.
277,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",[arrives with Sharon] What is that?
278,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,We're giving the boys some guns in return for our calves
279,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",What?
280,6,4,Sharon,You're giving my baby guns?
281,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"[snaps back] Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't! [walks off in a huff to the negotiation van] Get them on the line for me!"
282,6,4,Eric Cartman,[answers the ringing phone] Hello.
283,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain."
284,6,4,Eric Cartman,"All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. [in the background, Kyle takes out the guns, tossing them to Butters]"
285,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?"
286,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! [Butters assembles a machine gun while Kyle inspects a sword. Stan lies by a corner in a fetal position, on a calf, with more lesions appearing on his face]"
287,6,4,Stan Marsh,O-ogh...
288,6,4,Eric Cartman,"We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! [Butters plays soldier in the background, moving his gun around and then saluting while Kyle practices some lunges]"
289,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [to fellow agents as he holds his hand over the mouthpiece] Damnit, I'm losing them. [to Cartman] Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf."
290,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! [Kyle tosses a dud grenade at Butters, who hits it with a spear. The grenade flies off the bed and onto the floor. Kyle and Butters jump with joy]"
291,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,What do you have in mind?
292,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"A little to the left... [this time the crane is lifting a missile] Okay, that's good. A little to the right. [Butters and Kyle wait by the window again]"
293,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,You're giving them a missile??
294,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"[losing patience] Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust!"
295,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[dabbing Stan's sores with a moist towel] Stan's getting worse, you guys."
296,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Mike, speak."
297,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,How are we doin'?
298,6,4,Eric Cartman,"We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?"
299,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word ""veal"" to ""tortured baby cow."" [holds up an FDA document]"
300,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Good, good."
301,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.
302,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike."
303,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Now, now please can, can we get you to come out? [Cartman looks over at Stan, who looks sicker by the minute]"
304,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them."
305,6,4,Adults,Yes! All right! Woohoo!
306,6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator."
307,6,4,FBI Agent,They're coming out now?
308,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico."
309,6,4,Sharon,What??
310,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on ""Star Trek"" to drive the truck. [beat] In full makeup."
311,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",Jesus Christ!
312,6,4,FBI Agent,"All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action!"
313,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples."
314,6,4,FBI Agent,"Get out of here! [Dumont bolts. The agent talks to Barbrady] We'll get them the semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy. If they see that, thay'll come out and then, we could take them."
315,6,4,Officer Barbrady,But isn't that dishonest?
316,6,4,FBI Agent,"Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen?"
317,6,4,FBI Agent,All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?
318,6,4,Michael Dorn,"[aka Worf, arrives in full makeup] I was woken up at three in the mornng, told I had to put on makeup, and come to this town. [folds his arms] What the hell is gong on?!"
319,6,4,FBI Agent,"I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help."
320,6,4,Michael Dorn,This is highly unusual!
321,6,4,FBI Agent,"[on the bullhorn] All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International."
322,6,4,Eric Cartman,And Worf?
323,6,4,Michael Dorn,My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character called Worf.
324,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes to Stan] Stan! It worked!
325,6,4,Stan Marsh,[looking very weak and with a few more sores on his body] It... did?
326,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!"
327,6,4,Stan Marsh,Pick me up. I... I want to see. [Kyle picks him up]
328,6,4,Eric Cartman,Step back! Tell those men to step back!
329,6,4,FBI Agent,Do it!
330,6,4,FBI Agents,[lowering their weapons and stepping back] Mmrrrr.
331,6,4,Hippies,All right! Woohoo! Yeah!
332,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[heads for the street] Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies! [approaches the semi-truck, where Michael Dorn now sits at the wheel. He gets into the passenger side and sits] Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as ""Captain."""
333,6,4,Michael Dorn,Where am I supposed to drive to?
334,6,4,Eric Cartman,"No. See, must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"""
335,6,4,Michael Dorn,"Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
336,6,4,Eric Cartman,You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
337,6,4,Michael Dorn,This whole thing is ridiculous!
338,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[correcting Dorn] ""Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"""
339,6,4,Michael Dorn,"[beat, then in a low voice] Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous. [starts up the engine]"
340,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[calls out] Okay, all set!"
341,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom."
342,6,4,Butters Stotch,Okay Cartman!
343,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Step on it, Mr. Worf! [the semi peels off]"
344,6,4,Boys,All right!
345,6,4,Butters Stotch,We're going! [Kyle grins]
346,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Mexico here we come! [Dorn honks to clear everyone out of the way.]
347,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!"
348,6,4,Michael Dorn,We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!
349,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[correcting gently] ""Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"""
350,6,4,Michael Dorn,"Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads."
351,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers."
352,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on."
353,6,4,FBI Agent,"Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it! [another agent presses a button and a buzzer is heard. A few seconds later balloons fill up under the semi and lift it off the ground. The whole thing comes to a stop]"
354,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[looks out] Oh, it's a double-cross!!"
355,6,4,FBI Agent,"[approaches with his fellow agents] Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!"
356,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! No!!
357,6,4,Eric Cartman,"What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!"
358,6,4,Michael Dorn,I'm NOT killing anybody!
359,6,4,Eric Cartman,Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
360,6,4,Stan Marsh,"We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!"
361,6,4,FBI Agent,"[On the bullhorn] Alright boys, just stay right there until your parents arrive."
362,6,4,Michael Dorn,Can I go now?
363,6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you"
364,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Oh. [glances at the stack of veal forming next to him] Well, it doesn't matter now."
365,6,4,Officer Barbrady,What you do mean?
366,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"You see, in the six days since the word ""veal"" was officially changed to ""little tortured baby cow"" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see ""little tortured baby cow"" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'."
367,6,4,Butters Stotch,Really?
368,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life."
369,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry! [Stan doesn't respond. He's passed out] Stan? Stan?? [Butters appears next to them]"
370,6,4,Dr Doctor,He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.
371,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",Vaginitis?
372,6,4,Dr Doctor,"It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy."
373,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude."
374,6,4,Dr Doctor,We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
375,6,4,Eric Cartman,Thank God we stopped it in time.
376,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas."
377,6,4,Butters Stotch,Hear hear.
378,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start."
379,6,4,Chris,I'll say!
380,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Aw, we're still grounded?"
381,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause."
382,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer."
383,6,4,Chris,"That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms. [Sternly] But first, [softens] maybe we can grab some burgers."
384,6,4,The Boys,All right!
