0,6,3,Show Announcer,"Today on the Maury Povich show, these poor unfortunate people [a shot of one dwarf walking, then of another being interviewed by Maury] all have horrible disfigurements, [a shot of a man with elephantitis getting some popcorn, then going down an escalator] and you won't believe how we exploit them for your amusement! [Maury interviews a flatheaded man, a blond with stumps for arms wrestles with a brush in the shower]"
1,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Hm, that sounds pretty good."
2,6,3,Kenny,[walks in] (Hey guys. What's going on here?)
3,6,3,Stan Marsh,Hey Kenny! [the three boys grin]
4,6,3,Kenny,"(Gosh darn it, my name's not Kenny!)"
5,6,3,Eric Cartman,"That's awesome, Kenny. [""Kenny"" removes his hood, and it's Butters]"
6,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead."
7,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Not-Kenny."
8,6,3,Butters Stotch,"And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither! [takes off the coat and tosses it away] I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!"
9,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on."
10,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh, all right, then. [takes a seat on the sofa between Kyle and Cartman]"
11,6,3,Maury Povich,Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones
12,6,3,Damla,"[a blonde] Hello, Maury. [walks out. She has spindly legs, but no chest, abdomen or back. Think Mike Wazowski of ""Monsters Inc."" The boys are suitably disgusted]"
13,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Aww, sick dude!"
14,6,3,Maury Povich,"[Damla climbs onto the guest chair] You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you."
15,6,3,Damla,[voice quivering] Thank you
16,6,3,Maury Povich,[leans forward] Can you tell the audience how miseable your life is?
17,6,3,Damla,"Uh-uh, yes. It is."
18,6,3,Maury Povich,[giggles] You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?
19,6,3,Damla,Sometimes.
20,6,3,Maury Povich,[puts his left hand on her forehead] Do people sometimes stare at you?
21,6,3,Damla,Sometimes
22,6,3,Maury Povich,"[sits on the ground in front of her] Do they go, ""Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing""?"
23,6,3,Damla,Mmm-I don't know. [looks away and down]
24,6,3,Maury Povich,Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.
25,6,3,Damla,Yes.
26,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance! [the studio audience applauds, music starts up to lead to commercial] All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman who head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna giver her a makeover!"
27,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!"
28,6,3,Show Announcer,"Do you or someone you know have a disfigurement or disability that we can exploit on the Maury Povish show? If so, call 1-555-HEY MAURY!"
29,6,3,Stan Marsh,Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
30,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cool!
31,6,3,Eric Cartman,Oh YES!! [gets off the sofa and heads for the phone]
32,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh, that'd be awesome! [Cartman dials the number]"
33,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,[he and the other two follow Cartman] Do you think they'll believe it?
34,6,3,Stan Marsh,What disease should we say?
35,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Shhh. Be quite, you guys! [talks to someone on the phone] Hello, is this Maury Povish? [beat] Oh, well who the hell are you? [beat] Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks? [Stan grins, Kyle stifles a laugh] Ye-right, people with disabilities? [beat] Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show. [beat] Great! [beat] Hih-his condition? [beat] Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis."" [beat] Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin. [Stna stilfes a laugh and closes his eyes, then Butters stifles a laugh. All of them giggle. Cartman tells the others] Shut uh- shut up you guys. [beat, then on the phone] Yes. [beat] Yes, of course he's very upset about it. [beat] Yes, he cries all the time. [beat] Miserable, uh huh. [beat] You wha- Really?"
36,6,3,Stan Marsh,[drops his hands] What? [the others follow]
37,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!"
38,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Awesome!
39,6,3,Butters Stotch,Cool!
40,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show. [trying to be subtle] There will of course be a prize involved? [beat] Great. I'll call you back in an hour. [gladly] No, thank you. [hangs up] YES!"
41,6,3,Stan Marsh,This is gonna be so funny!
42,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh, it sure is!"
43,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
44,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?"
45,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
46,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters."
47,6,3,Stan Marsh,"We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?"
48,6,3,Butters Stotch,"We-ell hold on a second, you guys."
49,6,3,Eric Cartman,"[hops off the chair] Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies."
50,6,3,Butters Stotch,Hang on now.
51,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!"
52,6,3,Butters Stotch,Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
53,6,3,Stan Marsh,"It has to be you, Butters. Think about it."
54,6,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
55,6,3,Butters Stotch,"But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad."
56,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
57,6,3,Butters Stotch,"I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. [crosses his arms and looks away]"
58,6,3,Stan Marsh,[looks away and up] Kenny woulda done it. [Butters reacts]
59,6,3,Butters Stotch,...So? I told you guys before: [with emphasis] I'm not Kenny.
60,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool."
61,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend."
62,6,3,Stan Marsh,"[begins to walk and lead the others away] Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. [Butters now looks chastened]"
63,6,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
64,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?"
65,6,3,Brunet Trekker,"Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spirit gum."
66,6,3,Butters Stotch,Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.
67,6,3,Stan Marsh,Where's you get the balls from?
68,6,3,Brunet Trekker,"We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside."
69,6,3,Eric Cartman,Nice.
70,6,3,Blond Trekker,"Now we just blend the skin tones, add a little hair, [spins the chair around] and presto! [shows Butters' new look to the boys. Butters indeed sports a fake scrotum]"
71,6,3,Stan Marsh,Wow!
72,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,That looks awesome!
73,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aw, I feel silly."
74,6,3,Eric Cartman,"They look great on you, Butters. They really do."
75,6,3,Blond Trekker,I believe you owe us payment now? [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
76,6,3,Stan Marsh,"All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I"
77,6,3,Brunet Trekker,Wooww!
78,6,3,Blond Trekker,They weren't lying!
79,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] Why the hell would they want that anyway? [drops to a whisper] Episode I sucked balls.
80,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. [the Trekkers begin to fight over it the tape. Butters checks his new balls self-consciously]"
81,6,3,Blond Trekker,"Here, damnit!"
82,6,3,Brunet Trekker,"Hey, hey! Stop it, man!"
83,6,3,Show Announcer,Gay Air Flight 243 with service to New York now ready for general boarding.
84,6,3,Stan Marsh,"That's your flight, Butters."
85,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, here's your ticket [hands it to Butters] and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. [pushes him forward]"
86,6,3,Butters Stotch,Uh wait. [stops] You guys aren't comin' with me?
87,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV."
88,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[backs up into the lineup] Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go."
89,6,3,Eric Cartman,"God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?"
90,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, he sure is."
91,6,3,Stan Marsh,Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! [pause]
92,6,3,Eric Cartman,Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
93,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[hesitant] Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. [heads for the gate, then turns around. The boys wave at him. Butters looks down, then walks into the plane.]"
94,6,3,Stagehand,"Thanks for coming on the show, kid. Maury is very excited to meet you. And this is the Green Room where you can hang out with the other guests until we call for you on set. Boy with Balls on Chin, meet Man with Foot on Head, Girl with Rapid Aging Disease, Disfigured Country Singer, and Man With No Face."
95,6,3,Butters Stotch,Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
96,6,3,Man With No Face,"[goes for some water] Yes, this is my sixth appearance. [drinks]"
97,6,3,Stagehand,"I'll come back in a bit, folks. [leaves]"
98,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Hey Roger! [the stagehand stops] What the hell is with these horrible veggie platters?!
99,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, we told you last time we want fresher vegetables."
100,6,3,Roger,"I'm sorry, this is what the studio provides. Just take a seat on the couch, kid. I'll be back in a minute. [Butters looks at the others, then makes his way to a spot on the couch and sits down. A long silence follows]"
101,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,...Boy with balls on his chin. Haven't seen you around. How long have you been on the circuit?
102,6,3,Butters Stotch,What circuit?
103,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
104,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?"
105,6,3,Man With No Face,"Oprah two times, Jenny Jones once, Sally Jessie five times."
106,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,[looks at the man with no face] You've only done Jenny once?
107,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Oh, ah I hate doing the Jenny Jones show. They don't even have their own hair people."
108,6,3,Man With No Limbs,I'm doing Jenny tomorrow.
109,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, you picked a good show to do first, kid, but you need to learn the ropes. There are a lot of people like you all over the country, and we all do talk shows for a living."
110,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,We all know each other and we kinda stick together to make sure our industry is protected
111,6,3,Man With No Face,Yeah. Like when someone LIES about being a freak.
112,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[trembling] Oh they, they do, huh?"
113,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, they'll make up a fake condition to go on these shows and then take our money away!"
114,6,3,Man With No Limbs,We don't take kindly to that.
115,6,3,Butters Stotch,Well I can certainly see why.
116,6,3,Man With No Limbs,It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy.
117,6,3,Butters Stotch,Lobster Boy?
118,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Yeah, loh-, Lobster Boy used to make appearances on all the talk shows. He was one of the most popular disfigured peoiple on TV."
119,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,But then we all found out that Lobster Boy wasn't a real freak at all. He was just an actual lobster.
120,6,3,Man With No Limbs,[grousing] Lying sack of crap.
121,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,So you know what we did to him?
122,6,3,Butters Stotch,What?
123,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"One night all us freaks got together, and we... boiled him alive. [Butters stares, then an image of a lobster in a boiling pot appears, then vanishes]"
124,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,Now Lobster Boy is no more.
125,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers."
126,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,We're glad you agree.
127,6,3,Stagehand,"Okay, Boy with balls on his chin, you're up next."
128,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[hops off the couch and heads for the door.] Oh, Jesus, see me through this."
129,6,3,Show Announcer,"Next on the Maury Povich show: we bring back some of our favorite disfigured people [four scenes: first, the man with the foot on his head is talking to the girl with rapid aging disease and disfigured country singer, then the disfigured country singer is shown eating a subway sub, then the man with no face shows his disfigurement, and finally Butters' shadow is shown in profile] and introduce you to some new ones"
130,6,3,Stan Marsh,Here he comes.
131,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,This is gonna be awesome!
132,6,3,Maury Povich,Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
133,6,3,Eric Cartman,Testicles and scrotum! [laughs gleefully]
134,6,3,Maury Povich,"Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado. [Butters looks out timidly at the audience from behind the curtain, then heads for the guest chair.] Thanks so much for coming on our show."
135,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose."
136,6,3,Maury Povich,"So, is it tough being ...different?"
137,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uhhh, yeah."
138,6,3,Maury Povich,And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
139,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[forgetting why he's supposedly made of] They sure do. They always say to me, ""Butters, you're not Kenny."" But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-"
140,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, we're losin' him."
141,6,3,Butters Stotch,"I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it."
142,6,3,Maury Povich,"Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?"
143,6,3,Butters Stotch,Uh what condition?
144,6,3,Maury Povich,[terse] You have balls that hang off your chin.
145,6,3,Butters Stotch,"I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that."
146,6,3,Stan Marsh,Phew.
147,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Phew.
148,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that was close."
149,6,3,Maury Povich,What names do they call you at school?
150,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, ""Hey, there goes Chinballs!"" [Stan and Kyle grin, Cartman laughs hard]"
151,6,3,Maury Povich,"And do they call you ""freak"" and ""weirdo""?"
152,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, I s'psoe"
153,6,3,Maury Povich,[sits on the floor and draws closer] Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
154,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh, sure."
155,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you."
156,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Wait, here it is, here it is!"
157,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait, here it is, here it is!"
158,6,3,Eric Cartman,The present.
159,6,3,Maury Povich,"Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!"
160,6,3,Butters Stotch,Oh really?
161,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wow!
162,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""?"
163,6,3,Maury Povich,"Go on, you're going right now!! [Butters hops off and walks away happily]"
164,6,3,Stan Marsh,"But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!"
165,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
166,6,3,Eric Cartman,Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
167,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Hello, is this the Maury Povich show? [beat] Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin. [strokes his ""balls""] I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?"
168,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,"[just painted the fingermails on her right hand and is having them dry] I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic."
169,6,3,Eric Cartman,What's the new topic?
170,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,Please help my out-of-control child.
171,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!"
172,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,Really? [pulls out a notepad and starts taking notes] Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
173,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh, sure!"
174,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
175,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies"
176,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,"Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out."
177,6,3,Eric Cartman,"[stunned] ...my, my mom?"
178,6,3,Eric Cartman,Mmoooomm?
179,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Yes, sweetie?"
180,6,3,Eric Cartman,Could yo do me a favor?
181,6,3,Liane Cartman,"What's that, my little man?"
182,6,3,Eric Cartman,Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?
183,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop."
184,6,3,Eric Cartman,"I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?"
185,6,3,Liane Cartman,Orf course I do.
186,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother."
187,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Sweetie, don't."
188,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother. [turns around and walks out] Such a beautiful mother."
189,6,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!"
190,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[still wearing his balls, looking hurt] Oh I'm sorry, mom."
191,6,3,Chris,"Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!"
192,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again."
193,6,3,Chris,"Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!"
194,6,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!"
195,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[with voice trembling, turns around] Yes ma'am. [removes his balls]"
196,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? [his phone rings. Butters goes for the receiver]"
197,6,3,Stan Marsh,"[on the other end] Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?"
198,6,3,Butters Stotch,Oh Jesus! They were??
199,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they wanted to find you bad."
200,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?"
201,6,3,Stan Marsh,I- told them where to find you.
202,6,3,Butters Stotch,What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
203,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. [hangs up. Butters looks helpless, then walks to the window to see if the freaks are coming. They are indeed]"
204,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh Jesus no. [hops off his dresser and walks away from the window] They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here! [reaches his bedroom door, but turns around] Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! [the doorbell rings.]"
205,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Napoleon? [the disfigured country singer goes for the knob and opens the door.]
206,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Napoleon Bonaparte? [leads the other freaks in. Butters quickly prepares his false scrotum...] I think he's up here. [opens the door, and Butters grins back at them with one hand on the dresser and a suave pose. His balls are back in place]"
207,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?"
208,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"There you are, Boy With Balls On His Chin."
209,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,We've got big news! The union is striking.
210,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[relaxes] The union? Oh, that's why you came?"
211,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"We're tired of our crappy prizes! So the union president, Man with Terrible Skin Condition, has told us to round everyone up."
212,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded."
213,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Grounded for what?
214,6,3,Butters Stotch,"For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'. [strikes the pose again] Ah I'm not grounded."
215,6,3,Man With No Face,"Good, then you can march with us. Freaks of the world,"
216,6,3,The Freaks,Unite! [Butters looks at them]
217,6,3,Show Announcer,"Today on Maury Povich: These moms [three are shown. Only Liane grins] don't know what to do with their out-of-control kids! [a fat blonde girl is shown, then Cartman's school picture] Young boys and girls so whorish on our show that it borders on child pornography!"
218,6,3,Maury Povich,[on his stool] We're here talking with moms who think their children are out of control. [the woman next to him blows her nose] Vanessa here says that her thirteen-year-old daughter Vanity is already doing drugs and having sex with older men [Vanessa begins to bawl]
219,6,3,Studio Audience,Ooohhhhhhhh
220,6,3,Maury Povich,"Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework."
221,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"[sobbing] She says she hates me. She, she calls me ""retard""? And, she says my cooch is all dried up and nobody wants it. [sobs some more]"
222,6,3,Studio Audience,Aawwwwww. [music starts up]
223,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well, let's bring her out. Here's Vanity! [she steps out and the awws turn into boos]"
224,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"Wha'evah, wha'evah! You fuckin' cocksuckers don't know shit! Fuck you! [moosn the audience, and an OOPS! bubble appears over the area. Vanity then walks up to her mom and slaps her hard across the face. Vanessa winces in pain]"
225,6,3,Maury Povich,"Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen."
226,6,3,Some audience members,"Yeah! [the rest cheer, then a chant rises from the din] Maury! Maury!"
227,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"Wha'evah! Maury, my mom don't know shit! You could aks her! I aks her all my homies that they be down wit it. You know, it's all good shit. [the audience boos and she holds up her middle fingers, which are blurred] Fuck you, cocksuckuhs!"
228,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Jeez, that girl is pissed off."
229,6,3,Stagehand,"[enters] Okay, Cartman family, you're on in two minutes. [leaves]"
230,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,[weeping] Why can't you just listen to me and love me [Vanity slaps her] Ow!
231,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"Shu' up! Shut the fuck [slap] up, you God-aweful skank! [slap. Vanessa weeps again]"
232,6,3,Liane Cartman,"I'm glad you're not that bad, poopsie-kins"
233,6,3,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize. [leaves the room and finds the stagehand] Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?"
234,6,3,Stagehand,Second door on the right.
235,6,3,The Freaks,Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
236,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Brothers and sisters, the time has come for us to be treated with the respect we deserve! We are a strong and diverse group of people, with members like [shown] Woman with Crablike Body, [shown] Incredibly Obese Black Person, [shown] Man with Brains Outside of Head, and [shown] Liza Minnelli. The talk shows have us on and give us little gifts and perks while they make tens of thousands of dollars."
237,6,3,The Freaks,Yeah!
238,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"We told the talk shows our demands, and they laughed! They say they can get plenty of other stupid guests to go on their shows! So we must picket those other guests!"
239,6,3,The Freaks,Yeah!
240,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys."
241,6,3,Hammerhead Man,You're not gonna picket?
242,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,Who's not gonna picket? [the crown parts and all hands point to Butters]
243,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,Boy with Balls on Chin doesn't wanna picket. [lowers his left arm]
244,6,3,Butters Stotch,Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
245,6,3,Man with No Limbs,"[emerges from the crowd] Why? You're not a SCAB, are you?"
246,6,3,Butters Stotch,NO I I'm not a scab.
247,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Now, we will split up into groups and form picket lines. The first group will be led by: Incredibly Obese Black Man."
248,6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,"Escuse me, I'm not Incredibly Obese Black Man, I'm Incredibly Black Obese Man."
249,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"[looks at Incredibly Black Obese Man, then says flatly] ...Oh, right. My bad."
250,6,3,Show Announcer,"And now, back to more kids who are out of control, on the Maury Povich show!"
251,6,3,Maury Povich,Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.
252,6,3,Studio Audience,Awww.
253,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,Why won't you kids behave? [Vanity stands and smacks her acroos the face]
254,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"[shakes her mom around by the neck] Shut up, skank, he's not talkin' to you! [slaps her again and sits down]"
255,6,3,Maury Povich,"So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?"
256,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle"
257,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. [a video starts up with Cartman dolled up as a slut moving around to hip-hop music]"
258,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt! [brings out a lollipop] I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!"
259,6,3,Studio Audience,"[gasps, then] BOOOO!!"
260,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he's such a cutie."
261,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! [steps out from behind the curtain and immediately gives the finger to the audience]"
262,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Wha'evah! Wha'evah! [walks up to a seat next to his mom's and sits there] Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!"
263,6,3,Maury Povich,"Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?"
264,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear."
265,6,3,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs."
266,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I mean, sex and drugs."
267,6,3,Studio Audience,Oooohhh!
268,6,3,Eric Cartman,[hops off his chair and tries the audience] What-evah! What-evah! [snaps his left-hand fingers back and forth] I'll do what I waunt!
269,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"Oh, what-evah. You ain't tough, ho! I roam with gangs!"
270,6,3,Eric Cartman,Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! [sits back down]
271,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,What Evah! You ain't bad! You ain't nothin'! I ditch class and go shoot heroin in the school bathroom!
272,6,3,Eric Cartman,"What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!"
273,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,What do we want?
274,6,3,The Freaks,Better prizes!
275,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,When do we want them?
276,6,3,The Freaks,Now!
277,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,What do we want?
278,6,3,The Freaks,Better prizes!
279,6,3,Butters Stotch,[muttering along] Better prizes.
280,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,When do we want them?
281,6,3,The Freaks,Now!
282,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Never. [approached the Man with Terrible Skin Condition] Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me."
283,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together."
284,6,3,Butters Stotch,But I gotta get back to my family.
285,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"[drops his sign and drops on one knee next to Butters] We're you family too, Napoleon. We're like you. When we look at you we don't even see the testicles on your chin. We see the testicles in your heart. [back to the freaks] What do we want?"
286,6,3,The Freaks,Better prizes!
287,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,When do we want them?
288,6,3,The Freaks,Now!
289,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. [joins the others in the strike. Several police cruisers pull up and police pour out of them]"
290,6,3,Police Captain,"Okay folks, we're gonna have to move along."
291,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Why? We're a union and we have a right to picket.
292,6,3,Police Captain,"I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go."
293,6,3,Middle Dwarf,What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important?
294,6,3,Police Captain,"Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people."
295,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!"
296,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh."
297,6,3,Show Announcer,Who is the most out of controlled child? We're back with Maury.
298,6,3,Maury Povich,"We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control."
299,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,What evah!
300,6,3,Eric Cartman,I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
301,6,3,Maury Povich,"[walks to the third woman on the panel] Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old."
302,6,3,Studio Audience,Aawwww.
303,6,3,Joline and Chantal,"Mmhmm, that's right Maurih."
304,6,3,Maury Povich,"Let's bring her out: here's Chantal! [Chantal crawls out amid audience boos. The camera focuses on her diaper. Chantal reaches Joline, who picks her up and sits her on the chair next to hers] So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? [Chantal plays with her rattle]"
305,6,3,Joline and Chantal,"Maurih, it's like this: Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked!"
306,6,3,Studio Audience,Ooohhh!
307,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,Whatevah. I helped in a drive-by shooting.
308,6,3,Eric Cartman,What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
309,6,3,Maury Povich,"Wow, that is out of control!"
310,6,3,Joline and Chantal,"Why, just last night I had three gentlemen callers over to my house, and Chantal took her clothes off right in front o' everybody!"
311,6,3,Studio Audience,Boooo! [Chantal drops down and starts wiggling.]
312,6,3,Joline and Chantal,"You see? [Her diaper drops, then her top.] There she goes. There she goes. [Chantal shows her butt to the audience] OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE!"
313,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,[appearing] Attention Maury viewers
314,6,3,Maury Povich,What the hell is this? [another image replaces the one of Man with Foot on Head]
315,6,3,Elephant Man,"A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of hours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with ""freak"" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, ""Look for the True Freak label"" [his image fades to that of the True Freak label]"
316,6,3,Butters and the Freaks,"[Butters sits atop a True Freak label box and starts off] Look for the True Freak label
[four freaks join in] When you are watching a TV talk show
[a side shot of more freaks streaming their way to the box] Remember somewhere,
[a shot of the audience] our union's growing
[a front shot of the freaks walking in] Our wages going to feed the kids.
[a front shot of more freaks walking in] And run the house-
We work hard, but who's complaining?
[a zoom-out shot as the freaks crowd in around Butters] With TFU we're making our way!
[a pan shot] So always look for the True Freak label,
[a full crowd shot] Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.!
[the Maury Povich logo is restored]"
317,6,3,Maury Povich,"Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-"
318,6,3,"The Freaks, including
Man With No Face
Man With Foot On Head
Disfigured Country Singer
Man With No Limbs
Man With Terrible Skin Condition, their leader
Incredibly Obese Black Man
Dwarves
Elephant Man","They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. [takes her hand and leads her out. Other audience members begin to grouse and leave]"
319,6,3,Maury Povich,"[pleading] Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!"
320,6,3,Eric Cartman,[hops off his chair and steps forward] Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! [more audience members leave]
321,6,3,Show Cameraman,"Sir, the ratings have just started to plummet."
322,6,3,Maury Povich,"Ah, those damned freaks! [throws his microphone against the back wall and heads for the exit]"
323,6,3,Maury Povich,I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?! [the freaks simply look back at him] Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! [goes in and slams the door shut. A few seconds later the freaks cheer their victory]
324,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,We did it! The strike worked!
325,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,Now we can go on with our careers!
326,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. [drops his sign and moves off. An angry Cartman catches up to him]"
327,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! [rips the balls off Butters' chin. The frreaks react immediately and fall silent]"
328,6,3,Butters Stotch,Oh. Double hamburgers.
329,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Jesus Christ! That out-of-control kid ripped poor Napoleon's balls right off!
330,6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,Get him!
331,6,3,Eric Cartman,Aaahh! [three freaks trail behind with a boiling pot of water]
332,6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,"Get him! Get him! [the freaks charge at Cartman, who runs off in fear]"
333,6,3,Butters Stotch,Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. [a taxicab pulls up and screeches to a halt]
334,6,3,Chris,[quickly exits the cab with Linda] Butters!
335,6,3,Butters Stotch,[anticipating] Oh I know.
