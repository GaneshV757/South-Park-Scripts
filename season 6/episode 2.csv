0,6,2,Sharon Marsh,"Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda."
1,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, it was fabulous!"
2,6,2,Linda Stotch,"Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!"
3,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah. We figure that if our boys are goona be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too."
4,6,2,Linda Stotch,"Friends, by default. [giggles]"
5,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void."
6,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!"
7,6,2,Eric Cartman,"[alerting the other two] Look you guys, Butters is asleep."
8,6,2,Stan Marsh,He's such a douchebag
9,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? [drops down] When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water, [takes a glass of water and brings it to Butters' hand] and you put their hand in it... [dunks Butters' hand in it]"
10,6,2,Stan Marsh,"[watches as Cartman climbs the sofa] Yeah, and then what?"
11,6,2,Eric Cartman,"And then, you pee on it! [drops his pants and pees on Butters' hand] heheh-heheheheheheheh."
12,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee."
13,6,2,Eric Cartman,"[still peeing] Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh"
14,6,2,Chris,"And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend."
15,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that."
16,6,2,Chris,"No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation.."
17,6,2,Randy Marsh,They let you stay for free?
18,6,2,Chris,Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
19,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,Well that sounds like a good deal.
20,6,2,Randy Marsh,Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
21,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! [an '80s tune begins to play. A shot of the boys in the living room, then the adults pour in from the kitchen]"
22,6,2,Stephen Stotch,Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!
23,6,2,Stan Marsh,All right! [Butters stirs awake]
24,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,All right! [Butters stirs awake]
25,6,2,Eric Cartman,All right! [Butters stirs awake]
26,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies! [feels some tension as he stretches] Oh, I'm all sticky. [wipes his hands on the sofa and cushions]"
27,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Here we are, everyone. [Before them lies a valley with many buildings in it. Next to the station wagon is a sign reading ""WELCOME TO ASPEN""]"
28,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!"
29,6,2,Chris,Where are Butters and Eric?
30,6,2,Stan Marsh,They're still asleep.
31,6,2,Chris,"Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! [a knock on the door, and Linda rises to answer it. Two men enter]"
32,6,2,Phil,"[brunet] Hello, folks, I'm Phil and this is Josh [a blond]. We're with the Aspen Time-Share Company. [the other parents gather 'round]"
33,6,2,The Parents,Hello.
34,6,2,Josh,You folks enjoying the condo?
35,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,It's lovely. Thank you.
36,6,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!"
37,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,What
38,6,2,Eric Cartman,"So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler."
39,6,2,Stan Marsh,What's a Hitler?
40,6,2,Eric Cartman,"You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?"
41,6,2,Stan Marsh,"No, I never have."
42,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Shh-shh, here he comes."
43,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?! [Cartman starts laughing] A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?"
44,6,2,Eric Cartman,"[knowingly] Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!"
45,6,2,Phil,"Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?"
46,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, do we have to do it right now?"
47,6,2,Josh,"Well, best to do it and get it out of the way."
48,6,2,Chris,"Okay. [Phil and Josh leave, Sheila steps forward, and the adults begin to exit]"
49,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill."
50,6,2,The Boys,Okay.
51,6,2,Chris,We'll meet you boys on the slopes. [exits and closes the door]
52,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Hey, do you guys smell that?"
53,6,2,Stan Marsh,Smell what?
54,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. [Cartman chuckles]"
55,6,2,Eric Cartman,"I don't smell anything. Do you guys? [bursts out laughing. Stan and Kyle just look at him as Butters looks up, wondering...]"
56,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo."
57,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. [laughs at his cleverness. A skier skis up to them]"
58,6,2,Thumper,"All right, little dudes, [sets his skis aside] great to see you out here. My name is Thumper, and I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor. [gives the boys two thumbs up]"
59,6,2,Eric Cartman,[to Stan] His name is Thumper?
60,6,2,Thumper,"We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...? [puts his left hand to his ear, hoping for an answer. The boys just look at him] Time, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time."
61,6,2,Butters Stotch,So where's the part where we have a good time?
62,6,2,Thumper,"Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here. [motions to the nose, where Butters does indeed have crap]"
63,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Wuh, that's my face, sir."
64,6,2,Thumper,"Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together [he puts his indices and thumbs together; front ski tips touch], in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries. [begins to drift forward] You see that? [wedges the skis] Pizza, [lines up the skis] French fries, [wedges the skis] Pizza, [lines up the skis] French fries. [moves farther away each time]"
65,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?"
66,6,2,Thumper,"Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name?"
67,6,2,Ike Broflovski,Iiiiike!
68,6,2,Thumper,"Okay, Mike, ski down to me! [Ike looks down the hill, but doesn't move]"
69,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Go on, Ike."
70,6,2,Ike Broflovski,"[begins to practice the positions] Pee-za, Fron fries. Pee-za, Fron fries. Fron friiiies. [skis out of control] Peeee-zaaa [skis for a lodge and right through its wall.]"
71,6,2,Thumper,"Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time!"
72,6,2,Phil,"And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4."
73,6,2,Josh,That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!
74,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo."
75,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal."
76,6,2,Phil,"Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - ""Not me, I can't afford it."" But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!"
77,6,2,Josh,Wow!
78,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
79,6,2,Phil,"Well you see, ""time-share"" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves [exits screen left and immediately enters screen right] You [puts his hands together] ""share"" the condo with other investors and pick the [points to his watch] ""time"" you want to stay."
80,6,2,Josh,"[makes a fist with his right hand] Share, [makes a fist with his left hand] time. [joins his fists together] Time share."
81,6,2,Randy Marsh,So then it's not really ours.
82,6,2,Phil,"Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, ""I've got a little place in Aspen."""
83,6,2,Josh,"Try it. Try saying it. ""I've got a little place in Aspen."""
84,6,2,The Parents,I've got a little place in Aspen.
85,6,2,Phil,"Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary ""I've got a nice little place in Aspen?"" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives."
86,6,2,Randy Marsh,"[looks at his watch] Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?"
87,6,2,Phil,"Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend."
88,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
89,6,2,Phil,"Right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting. [the parents just look at him] Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at  the luncheon."
90,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[practicing his moves] ...French fries... pizza... french fries... [does the pizza moves and sees Cartman fallen on his back] come on, Cartman."
91,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, no more., [Kyle skis on. Stan is skiing as well, and another skier comes up to him, showering him with snow]"
92,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Looks like you think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid?"
93,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess."
94,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat me?
95,6,2,Stan Marsh,Uhh... no.
96,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"What's your name, hot shot? [two of his friends join him]"
97,6,2,Stan Marsh,Stan. Marsh.
98,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,Stan Marsh [laughs] Stan DARSH is more like it.
99,6,2,Skier,"Haaaa, Darsh! [his pole is slapped by the first skier's]"
100,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Alright, how about a race, then? You and me."
101,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I'm just learning."
102,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"OooooOOOOooo! [starts moving and squawking like a chicken, ending up facing Stan] Looks to me like you're not a ""hot shot"" after all."
103,6,2,Stan Marsh,I never said I was.
104,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,Oooooooo!
105,6,2,Tad s friends,Oooooooo!
106,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two! [the two other skiers left] See ya later, Darsh! [laughs, kicks some snow into Stan's face, and skis away]"
107,6,2,Phil,"And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,..."
108,6,2,Josh,It's downright smart!
109,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,Aha. [waiters come in with platters of food]
110,6,2,Phil,"Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch!"
111,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!"
112,6,2,Sharon Marsh,[apreciatively] Not bad. [Sheila and the others begin to eat]
113,6,2,Josh,"It's nice to feel rich, isn't it."
114,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, you know, this is really great."
115,6,2,Chris,It sure it. [the waiters whisk the plates away]
116,6,2,Randy Marsh,What?
117,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,What?
118,6,2,Randy Marsh,Wait...
119,6,2,Phil,You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford.
120,6,2,Josh,And then share it with the people that come tomorrow.
121,6,2,Randy Marsh,"All right, look, we've been here for over three hours"
122,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah. Can we go now, please?"
123,6,2,Phil,Of course you can. Go hit those slopes! [softly] If you could just please show me the backs of your table place cards real quick? [the others pick up their cards and look] Oh my God! You got the red sticker!
124,6,2,Josh,They got the red sticker?!
125,6,2,Phil,They got the red sticker!
126,6,2,Stephen Stotch,What's the red sticker?
127,6,2,Josh,"Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes."
128,6,2,Randy Marsh,"No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay."
129,6,2,Phil,"Okay, okay, fine, I mean... [his voice gradually drops to a whisper] It would only take a second, but, I mean, you know, what did we do for you except, give you a free condo for the weekend. Huh. Seems like you could just... could just come up... and see what prize you had... [Josh begins to cry]"
130,6,2,Stephen Stotch,O-all right!
131,6,2,Stan Marsh,...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
132,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries...[loses control and jerks forward, then flips over and lands next to Ike, who's half-buried in the snow. Kyle looks over and gets up quickly. He dusts himself off as Stan catches up] I wonder where our parents are."
133,6,2,Stan Marsh,Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
134,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[arrives, with his friends close behind] well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!"
135,6,2,Stan Marsh,[winces and covers his face with his right hand] Oh no.
136,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?"
137,6,2,Stan Marsh,Heather? [a woman skis up and stands next to the skier]
138,6,2,Heather,"Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves."
139,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean. [giggles]"
140,6,2,Heather,"You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests."
141,6,2,Stan Marsh,[just looks at them] ...who are you people?!
142,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh! [laughs disdainfully]"
143,6,2,Stan Marsh,"All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?"
144,6,2,Tad and friends,Oooooooo!
145,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now!"
146,6,2,Stan Marsh,Okay.
147,6,2,Tad s friends,Race! Race!
148,6,2,Resort Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Aspen Mountain presents another ex-TREME racing showdown. [the gathering crowd cheers] Seven-time World Aspen champion Tad Mikowski versus eight-year-old Stan Marsh!"
149,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Hah! You're going down, little boy!"
150,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, prob'ly"
151,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Do you think Stan has a chance? [the countdown begins. The chutes open and Tad takes off. Stan moves along allowing, sticking to the basic moves] Uh go Stan! [Tad flies down the hill, banking and weaving throughout. Stan appears a few seconds later, going down carefully]"
152,6,2,Stan Marsh,Fries... fries...
153,6,2,A skier,"[Tad zooms past him] He's got it! Tad's gonna win it! [as the crowd cheers, Tad clears the last few hills and then goes through the finish line. He comes to a stop and people gather around him]"
154,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[raising his arms in victory] Yeah! Yeeah! Yeah! You lose, Darsh! [kisses Heather, who reacts. They lock lips. Stan finally crosses the finish line, in the wedge position] Yeah! [Butters, Kyle and Ike walk up to Stan]"
155,6,2,Butters Stotch,"U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you."
156,6,2,Stan Marsh,"[drops his poles] Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. [a group of young adults walk by carrying Tad high in the air. The group stops, the boys turn around to see]"
157,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[looking down at Stan] No hard feelings, right Darsh?! [starts laughing.. The group moves away. The boys turn left as their eyes follow the group] Yeah!"
158,6,2,Teen Girl,"Stan, [theh boys turn to see her] for what it's worth, I think you were really brave."
159,6,2,Stan Marsh,Thanks. Who are you?
160,6,2,Teen Girl,"Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be at the youth center tonight for a dance. I hope you'll come because you're just so... we-hell, you're just so.. well, that's all. [turns around and walks off]"
161,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Finally, we get to go skiing!"
162,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are."
163,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy."
164,6,2,Lift Operator,Can I help you?
165,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?"
166,6,2,Lift Operator,"Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks."
167,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Thank you. [the parents move forward and position themsleves for the lift, which comes down presently. The parents get on and the lift goes up the slope again]"
168,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, this certainly is nice."
169,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody."
170,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!"
171,6,2,Linda Stotch,"Oh, Chris. [Randy giggles, then looks up]"
172,6,2,Chris,"Hey look, this trailer goes right into a building. [the lift turns, drops them off, and moves back out.]"
173,6,2,Phil,"Welcome back, folks!"
174,6,2,Josh,We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
175,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, God-damnit!"
176,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!"
177,6,2,Teen Girl,I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?
178,6,2,Stan Marsh,I' seems fine.
179,6,2,Voguing Skier,"Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building"
180,6,2,Voguing Skier 2,Where are all us kids supposed to go?
181,6,2,Stan Marsh,Don't care. [the boys go further onto the dance floor]
182,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,What do you wanna do now?
183,6,2,Stan Marsh,I dunno.
184,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Let's dance. [begins to dance. Cartman watches with dismay. Butters does a bunch of dancve movies, including the Moonwalk and some break-dancing]"
185,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. [the music is stopped and a voice is heard]"
186,6,2,Resort Announcer,"Alright, Aspen-heh. As a special treat tonight we're proud to have the winner of today's race, Tad Mikowski. [moves off and the crowd begins to cheer as Tad approaches the mic]"
187,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,Yeah!
188,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh,. God. [buries his face in his hand again.]"
189,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Hey everyone. [the crowd quiets down] I'd like to sing a little song, if I may."
190,6,2,The Ladies,[swooning] Ooooooooo.
191,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Gah, let's go you guys. [turns around and leads the others towards the door...]"
192,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. [Stan stops in his tracks]Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...Stan. Darsh. Darshy DaaarshStan DaaarshStan Darsh, Stan-darshStan Daaaaarsh DaaarshStan Darsh..."
193,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell is your problem?!"
194,6,2,Tad and friends,OooOOOOOOoooooo!
195,6,2,Stan Marsh,"I raced you, You won!"
196,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought."
197,6,2,Teen Boy,"He'll ski you anytime, anywhere"
198,6,2,Teens,Yeah!
199,6,2,Teen Girl,"[talking to Tad, referring to Stan] But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center"
200,6,2,Stan Marsh,What?
201,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13. [points at a window. The camera pans to the window, and a lone huge peak is shown. Tow teens look and are horrified]"
202,6,2,A Teen Boy,[steps into view] The K-13? But that's the most dangerous run in all of America. [steps away]
203,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?! [starts squawking like a chicken]"
204,6,2,Stan Marsh,"I'll be there, you queen!"
205,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Oh, yeah?!"
206,6,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
207,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow."
208,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?"
209,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I have to!"
210,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[shoves Stan a bit and faces him] Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude."
211,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's got Heather!"
212,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,You don't even know Heather!
213,6,2,Stan Marsh,"I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?"
214,6,2,Mechanic,"[appears out of nowhere] The K-13? You don't wanna go down that run. That run has got a history. Thirty-five people have died goin' down it, and some say you can still see their ghosts up there. It was on that very ski run that a group of students were killed by a wolf-boy who escaped from a mental institution. You see, that ski run was once a burial ground to a tribe of vampire Wichicaw Indians who ate the flesh of children with no eyes. Yah-, a lot of history on that ski run. [the boys just look at him]"
215,6,2,Stan Marsh,...Thank you.
216,6,2,Mechanic,Yah. [moves off]
217,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend."
218,6,2,Stan Marsh,"This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!"
219,6,2,Phil,...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving.
220,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
221,6,2,Josh,And we certainly don't want to pressure you.
222,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
223,6,2,Phil,"Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show."
224,6,2,Randy Marsh,"[Rises from his chair angrily] No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! [leads the others towards the door]"
225,6,2,Josh,I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?
226,6,2,Phil,"That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!"
227,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!"
228,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"My God, can you believe those people?!"
229,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation."
230,6,2,Randy Marsh,Let's just get out of here. [opens a door across the hall. The parents find themselves in a room exactly like the one they left across the hall]
231,6,2,Phil,"Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are still deeded properties!"
232,6,2,Parents,"Aaagh!! [they turn around and walk out... er, in]"
233,6,2,Phil,"Oooo, you folks really lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand!"
234,6,2,Josh,That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!
235,6,2,Stan Marsh,That does it! I'm calling the police! [takes out the cell phone and begins dialing. One of the salesmen groans softly]
236,6,2,Stan Marsh,"[approachs] Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13."
237,6,2,Thumper,"K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time."
238,6,2,Stan Marsh,"I have to do this, okay? I have to!"
239,6,2,Thumper,"Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!"
240,6,2,Singer and backup singers,"The day is approaching to give it your best
You've got to reach your prime!

[Thumper and Stan do some Tai Chi on their skis, then Thumper has Stan ski down the hill blindfolded while he takes notes on technique and time]

That's when you need to put yourself to the test
And show us the passage of time
We're gonna need a montage (Montage)
A sports-training montage (Montage)

[The teen girl is reading to Stan from a book: Skiing for ""DUMBASSES."" Then Thumper spots Stan as Stan does barbells, then has him do a few more runs. The times aren't satisfactory.]

And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)

[Bulldozers show up at the youth center to knock it down, but a group of families shows up to protest the demolition. Next shot, the parents are still at those meeting, getting quite weary and tired]

And with every shot, show a little improvement
To show it won't take too long
That's called a montage (Montage)
Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)

[Stan skis down a little faster, and Thumper shows him how much he's improved. Tad is then shown polishing his skills, landing after a ski jump and receiving Heather into his arms. The girl reads to Stan some more, but Stan's fallen asleep. She rouses him and resumes the lesson]

In any sport, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro
You'll need a montage (Montage)
a simple little montage (Montage)

[she shows Stan a few pictures in her book. Next, Stan is skiing down the hill with bricks weighing his shoulders down. Kyle stands on a bluff with a picture of himself and Stan and looks wistfully at it and at K-13. Cartman rubs his finger into his ass and gives a sleeping Butters the Hitler again. Cartman stifles a laugh]

Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)

[Again, Stan skis down the hill with Thumper looking on. Now Thumper approves of the time. The instructor, the teen girl, and Stan look out at K-13 from a nearby hill, the camera at their backs]

If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
Montage (Montage)

[The camera faces the trio now and zooms out slowly. Stan sets his skis down and steps into them, then skis down the slope. Fade out]"
241,6,2,Randy Marsh,"All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!"
242,6,2,Phl,"That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time."
243,6,2,Thin Cop,"All right, let me see if I got this straight. You two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability [suddenly animated] ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars?!"
244,6,2,Phil,That's right!
245,6,2,Fat Cop,Sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be you people for passin' up such a great deal!
246,6,2,Thin Cop,"That's right, you're practically stealing condos at that price. ""Book 'em, Danno!"" [laughs. The parents look on, chagrined]"
247,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, Jesus."
248,6,2,Linda Stotch,No! No!
249,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"The police work for time-share, too? [the police draw their guns and aim at the parents]"
250,6,2,Phil,"[somewhat menacing, moves forward] The police, the mayor, the president of the United States. Perhaps now you see the severity of your situation. I think we shall all sit down... [backs up] and listen to the presentation."
251,6,2,Josh,[draws his own gun and aims] Sit! [the parents go to the table and sit on the chair]
252,6,2,Phil,"Now, you're probably asking yourselves... ""Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?"""
253,6,2,Josh,"""What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"""
254,6,2,Phil,The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their-
255,6,2,Resort Announcer,The powder is fresh and the stage is set for Tad versus Stan on the K-13!
256,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!"
257,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. [Cartman gives him an angry look]
258,6,2,Resort Announcer,Ready. Set. Go! [the crowd cheers and Tad takes off. Stan begins to ski]
259,6,2,Stan Marsh,Pizza... pizza... pizza...
260,6,2,Man In Yellow Jacket,Tad's got the lead.
261,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Come on, Stan! [Tad is shown zipping down the hill, Stan is still at the summit making his way down]"
262,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,[stops near a tree] Haha. [pulls out a small saw hidden in the back side of his jacket] This should slow down Darsh a bit! [goes to the tree and starts sawing it off at the base. Stan has gone down the mountain some more]
263,6,2,Resort Announcer,[the crowd cheers the skiers on] And it looks like Tad is way out in front.
264,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[finishes sawing the tree in two and laughs] Now, I'll win for sure!"
265,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Awgh, dude, I can't look. [closes his eyes and covers them with his hands  Tad is shown zipping further down the hill, Stan has left the summit]"
266,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[stops and looks up the hill, then leaves. He returns with a bucket of sand and pours it out]Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! [leaves. Stan continues his run. Tad returns with more sand and pours it out]He doesn't stand a chance, now! [Stan reaches the fallen tree and climbs over it, then continues his run. Tad pours out even more sand]I'm gonna beat 'em! [tosses the bucket away and leaves]"
267,6,2,Resort Announcer,[as the crowd cheers] The race is half over and Tad is still out in the lead! [Stan is moving along nicely. Tad stops further down and pushes a large cage of hamsters onto the slope]
268,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!"
269,6,2,Teen girl,"[walks in] Oh, Tad."
270,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,...What are you doing up here?
271,6,2,Teen girl,"Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these. [lifts up her jacket and top. Tad look and is unable to move as he groans at what he sees. Stan moves along in the background and passes Tad, who remains spellbound. Stan reaches the finish line and breaks it. The boys and the crowd cheer the victory and approach Stan. Another song begins to play]"
272,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Good job, dude!"
273,6,2,Stan Marsh,Thanks. [Tad reaches the finish line to see the celebration start without him. He takes off his goggles and throws them to the ground in anger]
274,6,2,Resort Announcer,"You did it, Stan! [Tad approaches Heather, who gives him the cold shoulder and walks away. Tad is crestfallen]"
275,6,2,Teen girl,"Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center. [the crowd cheers louder, and the mechanic stops by]"
276,6,2,Mechanic,"Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits of the Wakichaw Indians can finally rest in peace. [three spirits rise from K-13 thanking Stan for setting them free.]"
277,6,2,Heather,"[walks up to Stan] Stan, I was wrong about you. Would you like to go out again? [Stan looks at her incredulously]"
278,6,2,Teen girl,"Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted. [the parents arrive]"
279,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"There you are, boys!"
280,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad!"
281,6,2,Stan Marsh,Where the hell have you guys been?!
282,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office."
283,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!"
284,6,2,The Boys,[disappointed] Awwwwww!
285,6,2,Stephen Stotch,What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing? [the song is stopped abruptly]
286,6,2,Stan Marsh,No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! [turns right and leads the other boys away]
287,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what a stupid sport! [the parents turn left and follow the boys away]"
288,6,2,Thumper,[looks at the teen girl] I heard that you were the one responsible for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.
289,6,2,Teen Girl,Yeah. Well he really flipped when he saw these. [lifts up her jacket and top again and two creatures appear where her breasts should be]
290,6,2,Left Creature,"[softly, slowly] Quaid..."
291,6,2,Right Creature,"[softly, slowly] Start the reactor..."
