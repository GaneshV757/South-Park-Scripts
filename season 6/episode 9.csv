0,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, cool. A preview. [the curtain goes up and the preview, for a PG-rated film, airs]"
1,6,9,Announcer,"Coming this summer [those words seem to approach the viewer], it's the classic film that changed America. E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, the new, redone version for 2002. [First, the classic shot of the kids flying across the sky with the moon in the background, then a shot of the kids taking off from the road. The police who are there to stop the kids have walkie-talkies in hand instead of guns.] All the E.T. effects have been digitally upgraded. [a shot of E.T. dressed in drag walking across a room] All the guns have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies. And the word ""TERRORIST"" has been changed to ""HIPPIE."""
2,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Aw, dude, why would they do that?"
3,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing."
4,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C."
5,6,9,Stan Marsh,That's gay. [next trailer airs. No rating seen]
6,6,9,Announcer,"Coming this summer, it's the motion picture that changed America. Saving Private Ryan, the RE-RE-RELEASE, where the word ""NAZI"" has been changed to ""PERSONS WITH POLITICAL DIFFERENCES,"" and all their guns have been replaced by walkie-talkies. [a shot of the landing at Normandy, in all its bloody glory, but all the guns are indeed walkie-talkies]"
7,6,9,Stan Marsh,Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
8,6,9,Announcer,"And now, for your feature presentation: the classic RE-RE-RE-RELEASE of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"
9,6,9,The Boys,Woohoo!
10,6,9,Announcer,"In the version, the word ""WOOKIE"" has been changed to ""HAIR CHALLENGED ANIMAL"" and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by Ewoks."
11,6,9,The Boys,"[first express shock, then anger] AWWWW!!! [they leave their seats.]"
12,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit, that pissed me off!"
13,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[they reach the ticket booth] Yeah, we want our money back!"
14,6,9,Shlomo,"Sorry, suckers! [quickly rolls the blinds down. The boys turn around]"
15,6,9,Eric Cartman,You asshole! [turns around and catches up with the other boys]
16,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
17,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore."
18,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!"
19,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now."
20,6,9,Stan Marsh,We have to do something. Let's form a club.
21,6,9,Eric Cartman,Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
22,6,9,Stan Marsh,"No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!"
23,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club"
24,6,9,Eric Cartman,Yeah
25,6,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah
26,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!"
27,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!"
28,6,9,Tweek Tweak,I'm not! I'm not a team player!
29,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!"
30,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[giving in] D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!
31,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!"
32,6,9,Stan Marsh,Well what's wrong with it?
33,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. [takes the marker and adds the words ""FRee HAT"" at the very end.]"
34,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"""Free hat?"""
35,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up."
36,6,9,Tweek Tweak,But we don't have hats!
37,6,9,Eric Cartman,Well we can just make them out of paper.
38,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Aahh!
39,6,9,Eric Cartman,"It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!"
40,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??"
41,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. [walks off with Cartman and Kyle screen right]"
42,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Fifty hats? Oh Jesus! [runs off screen left]
43,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! [his father happens by and notices the commotion]
44,6,9,Richard Tweek,[approaching with his own mug] Tweek!
45,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[shrieks] Hrrr!
46,6,9,Richard Tweek,"Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center."
47,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"My center. My... center. [closes his eyes and cups his chest] Calm [enters a state of meditation. Richard turns and leaves, his cup stays] Cup? [he finds himself sitting in the Lotus position by the side of a serene stream in a lovely meadow. All kinds of animals frolic around him, and a small Buddhist temple sits in the background]"
48,6,9,Eric Cartman,[enormous face appearing over the clouds] Tweek! [brushes the clouds away with his hands] TWEEK!! [Tweek opens his eyes] TWEEK!!
49,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[comes out of his meditation] Gaaaaah!
50,6,9,Eric Cartman,How many hats have you made?
51,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh God!
52,6,9,Eric Cartman,We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow! [slaps him hard across the back.] Get the lead out!
53,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Aaaah! Oh God! [Cartman turns and walks out, a rattled Tweek resumes making the hats.]"
54,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"You guys, we have a big problem!"
55,6,9,Stan Marsh,What?
56,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!"
57,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough."
58,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet. [turns and opens the door, then peeks in. The place is packed. All the bleachers are filled, and there are five rows of people standing on the gym floor. He backs out, closes the door, and turns to his friends] Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!"
59,6,9,Tweek Tweak,A thousand? [freaks out] Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
60,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!"
61,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Goohoo!
62,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps forward] Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats."
63,6,9,Crowd,"[from inside the gym] Free hat! [Kyle turns right, then left, not believing what he's hearing. Tweek's jaw drops] Free hat! Free hat!"
64,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[""Free hat!""] Oh God!"
65,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[""Free hat! Free hat! Free hat! Free hat!""] I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat."
66,6,9,Crowd,Free hat! Free hat!
67,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"I gotta move away, you guys!"
68,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats."
69,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[takes the mic] Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause."
70,6,9,Crowd,Yeah! Yeah!
71,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. [the cheering dies down and a voice pipes up]"
72,6,9,Skeeter,Eh- Excuse me?
73,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes the mic] Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them."
74,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
75,6,9,Woman,[a blonde] We don't care about that.
76,6,9,Tweek Tweak,You don't?
77,6,9,Stan Marsh,"You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?"
78,6,9,Skeeter,Yeah. Free Hat.
79,6,9,Tweek Tweak,What?
80,6,9,Man,"Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!"
81,6,9,Man 2,Yeah!
82,6,9,Crowd,Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
83,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Aaaah, [""Free Ha-""], okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? [the crowd stops moving]"
84,6,9,Man,To do what?
85,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
86,6,9,Skeeter,"Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. [the crowd breaks up and exits]"
87,6,9,Crowd,Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
88,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Waitwaitwaitwait! [the crowd stops] Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!"
89,6,9,Skeeter,Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?
90,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat."
91,6,9,Some people,Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!
92,6,9,Crowd,Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
93,6,9,Stan Marsh,"...212, 213, 214 members!"
94,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[barges in through the front door] You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!"
95,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
96,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
97,6,9,Stan Marsh,Really? That's great.
98,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yah.
99,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!"
100,6,9,Stan Marsh,"If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films."
101,6,9,Eric Cartman,But just remember that I do all the talking.
102,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,You?? Why?
103,6,9,Eric Cartman,Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
104,6,9,Stan Marsh,When did we do dibs for it?
105,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Just now - [quickly, counting off with his left hand] 1 2 3 dibs! [punches his right palm with his left fist]"
106,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Me.
107,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Ga-ahah!
108,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, fine! [points to Cartman] You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!"
109,6,9,Eric Cartman,What could possibly go wrong?
110,6,9,Ted Koppel,"A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?"
111,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[blinks and looks at the camera for a long time] ...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. [the camera moves from Cartman to Tweek]"
112,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Gaaarh!
113,6,9,Ted Koppel,"Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?"
114,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[""TWEEK, ADVOCATE OF TODDLER MURDER"" appears at the bottom of the screen] Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!"
115,6,9,Ted Koppel,"Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as ""positive"" about toddler murder?"
116,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?
117,6,9,Ted Koppel,"[ponders the possibility] Yes... It is easy. [switches gears] Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?"
118,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
119,6,9,Ted Koppel,"Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [they walk in and stand behind the boys. The boys look at them a bit awed]"
120,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!
121,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"[wearing a CSLB jacket and director's hat] Hello, Ted."
122,6,9,George Lucas,"[meekly] Oh hi, Ted."
123,6,9,Ted Koppel,"Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?"
124,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers."
125,6,9,George Lucas,You're here.
126,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[to Stan] Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [resumes gawking at the two]"
127,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!"
128,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children."
129,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children."
130,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we're children."
131,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?"
132,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted."
133,6,9,Ted Koppel,How so?
134,6,9,Eric Cartman,Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
135,6,9,George Lucas,I'm not a Jew! [crosses his arms in anger]
136,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ewver did."
137,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!"
138,6,9,Steven Spielberg,[a stroke of brilliance overcomes the two men for a few seconds] Wait a minute. What'd you say?
139,6,9,George Lucas,"Eh, that's brilliant!"
140,6,9,Steven Spielberg,Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!
141,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,[regretting the comparison] No. NOO!!
142,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark. [the crowd begins to murmur] There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? [hands the mic to Cartman, who moves over to an easel]"
143,6,9,Eric Cartman,Thank you. [turns a page up and over. A schematic of George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch is shown] Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
144,6,9,Man 3,And if we get a hold ot the negative they can't change the movie?
145,6,9,Stan Marsh,That is our understanding.
146,6,9,Woman,Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
147,6,9,Crowd,YEAH!
148,6,9,Skeeter,Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!
149,6,9,Crowd,YEAH! [the signs go up] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
150,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rusn to the mic] Nonono! We need to do this first.
151,6,9,Woman,But we have to free Hat.
152,6,9,Stan Marsh,"It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies."
153,6,9,Man 4,"Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!"
154,6,9,Crowd,YEAH!
155,6,9,Eric Cartman,He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
156,6,9,Skeeter,Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.
157,6,9,Man 5,"Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!"
158,6,9,Crowd,YEAH! [the signs go up] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
159,6,9,Stan Marsh,Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
160,6,9,Skeeter,"He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat."
161,6,9,Crowd,YEAH! [the signs go up and the crowd moves out. Not one of them stays with the boys] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
162,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves."
163,6,9,Tweek Tweak,No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! [walks off the stage]
164,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
165,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Hwaaah!
166,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up to stop Tweek] Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well."
167,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Haaah!
168,6,9,Eric Cartman,"People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?"
169,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Okay, go. [the other boys, with their own flashlights, pour in]"
170,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[trying to stay composed, with eyes closed] I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field."
171,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[draws near] Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! [walks off]"
172,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,[eyeing a prop] This looks like the right room.
173,6,9,Tweek Tweak,I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.
174,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[finding the video library] Over here! [the other boys join him at the stacks. They see ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 300,"" ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 301,"" ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 302,"" etc., then ""First Day of School"" and ""First Day of School, Digitally Enhanced,"" then ""Wedding Video"" and ""Wedding Video, Digitally Enhanced."" The camera scans past ""Kids First Swimming Lesson"" and ""Kids First Swimming Lesson w/ Digitally Enhanced Weather"" to stop at the reel of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark, Original Negative 1982.""]"
175,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,That's it!
176,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!"
177,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Huh uh.
178,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!"
179,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Guh huh huh! [walks off and returns with a stool. He climbs up on it and gets the reel canister. The door opens behind the boys and the lights go on]
180,6,9,George Lucas,What are you doing?! [the boys turn in horror]
181,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh God! Oh Jesus!
182,6,9,George Lucas,You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that! [grabs the film reel from Tweek]
183,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[hops off the stool] Aaaaaah!
184,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas! [goes down on his right knee] But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark."
185,6,9,George Lucas,"We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!"
186,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B."
187,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Aw, really?"
188,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Oh God, no! Not Plan B! [Lucas looks at the boys quzzically]"
189,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[beat] You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? [the boys reach for the left side of their bodies and rip off their clothes. Underneath they wear colorful Latin outfits and grin.]"
190,6,9,George Lucas,[confused] ...What??
191,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Hit it, Tweek! [Tweek goes over to a boombox and presses the play button, then returns to the group. Caribbean music plays] In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-"
192,6,9,Stan Marsh,Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
193,6,9,Eric Cartman,"...No, he has an icy heart."
194,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart."
195,6,9,Stan Marsh,"So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song"
196,6,9,Eric Cartman,It's a cool island song.
197,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
198,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, do we wanna do that?"
199,6,9,George Lucas,"ALRIGHT, that does it!"
200,6,9,George Lucas,"[listening] Yes, thank you, officer. [hangs up and walks around the boys] The police are on their way, boys. [stops and faces them] Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED!"
201,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[freaks out] Aaaahh!
202,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. [Lucas looks at them]"
203,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. [Lucas hangs his head in shame and turns away]"
204,6,9,George Lucas,"It is... too late for me, boys."
205,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
206,6,9,George Lucas,"M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them"
207,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[steps forward] You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours."
208,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society"
209,6,9,George Lucas,Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?
210,6,9,Stan Marsh,Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
211,6,9,George Lucas,"[turns and approaches them] Perhaps... you are right. [presents the reel to Stan, but a door opens...]"
212,6,9,A Voice,"STOP! [Lucas is startled and the camera pans to Steven Spielberg and three guards] What are you doing, George?!"
213,6,9,George Lucas,"Steven, Uh, I-"
214,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!"
215,6,9,George Lucas,"Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was good."
216,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?! [voice lowers] Don't forget: you belong to me."
217,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! [Lucas, stuck between the two arguments, stops and thinks...]"
218,6,9,George Lucas,"I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys. [slowly walks to Spielberg and presents the reel. Spielberg snatches it away]"
219,6,9,Steven Spielberg,[cackles] Now take the children prisoner! [the guards approach and surround the boys]
220,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,What??
221,6,9,Steven Spielberg,You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW Raiders of the Lost Ark! Your gay little club is over!
222,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! [the boys turn and make their way to the door]"
223,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[runs] Oh my God they're gonna kill us. [the guards block the way, and the other three boys are stuck. Kyle tries to get around a guard, but...]"
224,6,9,Guard 1,"[aims his walkie-talkie at him] Don't even think about it, kid! I'm not afraid to use this walkie-talkie!"
225,6,9,Guard 2,"The one with the cocaine-problem escaped, mein Direktor."
226,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Leave him!! Let him run back to his mommy! [strokes the reel canister] We must get the film ready for the premiere. [turns and walks off] Lucas! Come! [Lucas, shame-faced, turns and follows Spielberg out. The boys look at the guards]"
227,6,9,Announcer,"[""COMING THIS SUMMER""]Coming, this summer! [""RE-RELEASE OF EPISODE 1 SOUTHPARK""] It's the digitally-enhanced re-release of the very first pilot episode of South Park! [scens from ""Cartman Gets An Anal Probe"" play - the cafeteria, the boys walking down the street, Stan, Kyle, and Wendy in the woods, Stan and Kyle at Stark's Pond...] Yes, the classic, rough, hand-made first episode is getting a make-over for 2002! [the visitors are shown, then new 3D versions are shown] The simple, funny aliens are now super-badass and kewl! [the mothership is shown beaming Cartman up, then a much more intricate version is shown] Flying saucer? No longer cheap construction paper, but a 4.0 megapixel constructed through a masterpiece of technology! Everything's new! New is better!"
228,6,9,Trey Parker,"[bearded] When we first made South Park, we didn't wanna use construction paper. We just had to because it was cheap."
229,6,9,Matt Stone,"And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused."
230,6,9,Trey Parker,Expensive. [Both men nod their heads]
231,6,9,Announcer,"[The flames coming from Cartman's ass are replaced with a 3D version, and cars and people are added to the scene] Yes, all the charm of a simple little cartoon [a model of the new ship is rotated to a new position] will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation!"
232,6,9,Trey Parker,"[a shot of him, then of the bus stop with the boys waiting for the bus. New creatures enter the scene] For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it."
233,6,9,Announcer,"[A special-edition DVD of CGAAP ""new version for 2002"" is shown. ""ACT NOW"" blinks on the screen over the DVD]Get this special enhanced version quick, because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for 2003!"
234,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president [Stan], treasurer [Kyle], and secretary [Cartman] have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!"
235,6,9,Man 3,"Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?"
236,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[grits his teeth, shuts his eyes and bows his head in frustration] Yes, just like hat!!"
237,6,9,Skeeter,But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison? [the other members grumble]
238,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!"
239,6,9,Woman,"Hey, he's got a point there."
240,6,9,Man 6,[a rancher] Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song!
241,6,9,Townspeople / Free Hat Club Members,[scattered reaction] Yeah.
242,6,9,Tweek Tweak,No!
243,6,9,Skeeter,No?
244,6,9,Man 7,No! He's right. We have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song.
245,6,9,Woman,Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
246,6,9,Man 8,Let's cool his hot temper with a fresh island song.
247,6,9,Man 9,That's it!
248,6,9,Man 1,Let's go! Come on! [the members rally and take off]
249,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
250,6,9,Pat O Brien,"Well, the print is finished and the day has come. Tonight, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas [shown] will be at the premiere of the new special edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lots of celebrity guests and other rich people will be on hand to witness all the updated effects and modernized technology."
251,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Hello!
252,6,9,Steven Spielberg,[moves forward and takes a hard look at the figure on the hill] The kid? The tweaked out kid?!
253,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg! [the other boys try to sneak away, but the guards are around them quickly]"
254,6,9,Steven Spielberg,Your pesistence surprises even me. [begins to fan himself with his hat]
255,6,9,Francis Ford Coppola,[steps forward] Surely you don't think you can escape from this premiere.
256,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[fixes his aim on his target] That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
257,6,9,Eric Cartman,Wow.
258,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
259,6,9,Eric Cartman,AY!
260,6,9,Francis Ford Coppola,And if we refuse?
261,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Then your premiere has no movie!
262,6,9,Stan Marsh,He's definitely lost it
263,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yup.
264,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"[moves around to clear the area] Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand ba- stand back! Back! [people move away] Okay kid, you win. [puts on his hat] Blow it up. [some guards try to get the box, but Spielberg takes a walkie-talkie and forces them back] Zuroch!  Zuroch! [turns and faces Tweek] Blow it back to God. [Tweek trembles, but his aim doesn't waver] All your life has been the pursuit of seeing a great film! This new version of Raiders has digital effects beyond your wildest dreams! You want to see it screened just as much as I. [Tweek grunts, showing he may be breaking]"
265,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!"
266,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"[turns, walks to the box, and stands next to it] Son, we are simply passing through history. This... is imPROVED history. [Tweek stalls. The boys wait for Tweek's next move] Do as you will. [backs away, leaving the box clear. Tweek struggles, but lowers the launcher. Three guards appear behind him]"
267,6,9,Townspeople / Free Hat Club Members,"In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, the air is fresh and the people are free."
268,6,9,Man 5,But here in the mountain there's no freedom like that.
269,6,9,Skeeter,There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. [the governor looks up a bit surprised]
270,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"[moving his arms over the Ark] Hafaa malifi! Thanks for coming, everyone. [the two men return, remove the lid, and walk off with it. A third man reaches inside the Ark and pulls out the ""RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK NEW AND IMPROVED 2002"" reel] This is the birth of the NEW version of Raiders of the Lost Ark! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration!"
271,6,9,Premiere Audience Members,Hooray! All right!
272,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Begin the film! [a man loads the film and plays it. On screen, three men appear and approach a mountain]"
273,6,9,Premiere Audience Members,[impressed] Whoa.
274,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[pleading] You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it."
275,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Ah, what?!"
276,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[pleading] Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! [the boys quickly turn away, shut their eyes, and bow their heads]"
277,6,9,Premiere Audience Members,[impressed] Whoa. Ahhh.
278,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"It's beyooootiful. [a scene of Indiana Jones using a whip to swing across a chasm. Flaming arrows shoot past him. As he lands on theother side, natives approach.They look and chatter like Ewoks]"
279,6,9,Viewer 1,Wait a minute. This version is awful!
280,6,9,Viewer 2,Yeah! They ruined it!
281,6,9,Viewer 3,"Oh my God, it's terrible! [George Lucas is suddenly frightened stiff. Coppola is also frightened. The boys keep their eyes closed and away from the screen]"
282,6,9,George Lucas,AaaaAAAAA!!
283,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Yuh, you guys okay. [the others open their eyes. The ropes that bound them are gone]"
284,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I I think so.
285,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Man, that new version must have sucked balls."
286,6,9,Mayor's Aide,"Today is a day of celebration, and we owe it all to these four brave young boys. [The four boys grin]"
287,6,9,Townsman,Yeah! Alright!
288,6,9,Mayor's Aide,"And thanks to the bravery of this young man in particular, [Tweek smiles proudly] ...Hat McCollough is finally free from prison! [the smiles fade from the boys' faces]"
289,6,9,Townsfolk,Yeah! Woohoohoo!
290,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,...What? [a thin balding man with creepy appearance walks onstage and waves to everyone]
291,6,9,Townsfolk,Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat!
292,6,9,Hat McCollough,"Thank you everyone-KILL! KILL THE INNOCENT!! Uh, I'm so thankful for all your support-RAPE THE VIRGINS!! And uh, I just wonder if i could get a baby real quick? [grins in a creepy way. The crowd falls silent for a moment]"
293,6,9,Skeeter,Sure. Give that man a baby!
294,6,9,Townsfolk,Yeah! Woohoohoo! [the aide comes onstage holding a baby in his arms. Hat looks at the baby sinisterly. The baby senses this and quickly crawls up the aide's arm and onto his shoulder]
295,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys turn and walk off. Tweek can't help but look at the baby's fate]"
296,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh my God!
297,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan? [the boys stop] I mean, no one even seemed to notice."
298,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world."
299,6,9,Eric Cartman,That and youth. Those guys are old.
300,6,9,Tweek Tweak,But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
301,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it."
