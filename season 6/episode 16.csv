0,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[thrusts the bag at Clyde] Throw it away, Clyde!"
1,6,16,Clyde Donovan,I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
2,6,16,Stan Marsh,[arriving] What's going on?
3,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,[points at the joint] Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
4,6,16,Stan Marsh,So throw it away.
5,6,16,Clyde Donovan,Nobody wants to touch it.
6,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
7,6,16,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?"
8,6,16,Clyde Donovan,And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
9,6,16,Stan Marsh,"You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations."
10,6,16,Token Black,How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.
11,6,16,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, I did Ecstasy once. [the other boys look at him] Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. [the other boys just stare]"
12,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,...Where did you have sex with her?
13,6,16,Jimmy Valmer,"In her... va-vagina. [smiles, but the other boys remain silent] Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience."
14,6,16,Stan Marsh,[annoyed at his friends' skittishness] It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
15,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[takes the bag from Kyle and offers it to Stan] Then you throw it away, smartass. [Stan walked into that one]"
16,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Fine, I will. [takes the bag and walks over to the stump, faces the boys, and tosses the joint into the bag] There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal."
17,6,16,Ozzy,You kids [bleep] don't [bleep] around with your [bleep] mom!
18,6,16,Jack,"Dad, we [bleep]ing can't! It's a big [bleep]ick a [bleep]"
19,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"[enters scolding] Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?"
20,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come on, Mom."
21,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"It's going to make you retarded! [starts flipping channels, then settles on a news report, then walks away]"
22,6,16,Stan Marsh,"It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!"
23,6,16,Grandpa Marvin,Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.
24,6,16,Tom,"In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago. [a silhouette of a man running is behind the words ""CRAZY MAN"" and a question mark is on the silhouette] The man claimed to be from the future and ran naked through the city streets screaming ""The past! The past! Oh my God, it's the past!"" Which is what one would expect someone in the future to yell. [a knock is heard on the front door, Sharon goes to answer it. Before her stands a disheveled man with long brown hair and stubbly beard. He's wrapped in a large towel and wears a blue cap with red piping and puff, like Stan does]"
25,6,16,Naked Man,"[slurring his voice] Oh my God, it's the past! [looks at Sharon] Oh, whoa man, it's you!"
26,6,16,Sharon Marsh,Who are you?
27,6,16,Naked Man,"It's me, Mom, your son Stan. [Sharon looks shocked, and the camera zooms in on that. Behind her, still watching TV, are Stan and Marvin. Stan looks over]"
28,6,16,Randy Marsh,"[joining Sharon at the door] Who is it, Sharon?"
29,6,16,Naked Man,Dad!
30,6,16,Randy Marsh,Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
31,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[rises from the sofa and walks over] Who the fuck is it, Mom and Dad?"
32,6,16,Naked Man,"No way, it's me from the past! [looks quite relieved]"
33,6,16,Stan Marsh,I'm me from the past?
34,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"[genuflects to Stan, who leans back a bit] No, I'm you from the future! [rises, and Randy helps him up] Oh man, this is so messed up."
35,6,16,Randy Marsh,"[pushing the man out the door] Okay, we've had enough!"
36,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist, and you don't like chicken. Mom, your maiden name is Kimble and you have a scar on your left knee from when you slipped in the swimming pool."
37,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"[in hushed tones] Randy, what's going on?"
38,6,16,Randy Marsh,[in hushed tones] I don't know.
39,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Dude, just let me talk to you for like, five minutes. After that I'll bail."
40,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out."
41,6,16,Randy Marsh,How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
42,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"But why are you back in this time with us, son?"
43,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"I have no idea, man. I was just about to go asleep in an alley behind the crackhouse, [Stan is aghast at what he would become] and I shot up a little heroin, and then this electrical storm started. Next thing I knew I was running around in my own past, man. I thought... I was just tripping, but then I came down and I was still here. Oh, dude, it's so bizarre!"
44,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!"
45,6,16,Randy Marsh,"[laying hands on the man's shoulder] Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you."
46,6,16,Sharon Marsh,[reaching out] That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.
47,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,Thanks. Can I get another beer?
48,6,16,Sharon Marsh,You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
49,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,That'd be killer. Where can I crash?
50,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?"
51,6,16,Stan Marsh,What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! [squeezes his eyes shut and buries them in his right hand]
52,6,16,Singer,"Here we are, face to face, ""My Future Self -n- Me"" 
[Stan and Future Stan stroll down a road. Future Stan has a beer]"
53,6,16,Stan Marsh,[right at the camera] Stop it.
54,6,16,Singer,"So much alike, and yet so different"
55,6,16,Stan Marsh,[Stan's future self joins him in bed after freshening up in the bathroom] No.
56,6,16,Singer,"One of them's messy, the other one's clean!
[Stan's future self turns off the light while Stan looks pissed off]
Gettin' along isn't always easy, sometimes we disagree
[Stan's future self brushes his teeth as Stan stands next to him, avoiding him. Future Stan spits his frothy toothpaste into the sink]"
57,6,16,Stan Marsh,Quit it.
58,6,16,Singer,"But in the end we know we're good for each other
[both Stans eat cereal, but the future Stan has trouble pouring milk into his bowl. It splashes out of the bowl along with some cereal. Stan just buries his face in his hands in frustration]
Two peas in a pod, Future Self -n- MeFuture Self -n- Me, Future Self -n-
[Now they have separate beds. Stan turns the light out and tries to sleep. Future Stan reaches over to turn it on. Stan moves to turn it on, and they fight over the switch until one of them sleeps]
Me"
59,6,16,Stan Marsh,Hey guys.
60,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,Hey.
61,6,16,Eric Cartman,Hey.
62,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys."
63,6,16,Eric Cartman,Who's this asshole?
64,6,16,Stan Marsh,This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
65,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. That's pretty cool.
66,6,16,Eric Cartman,Then how does he know our names?
67,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,"'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows."
68,6,16,Eric Cartman,Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
69,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol. [Cartman has a hearty laugh]"
70,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman!"
71,6,16,Eric Cartman,That is so awesome!! Thank you God! [bows deeply] Oh praise God!
72,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, what happens to me in the future?"
73,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006."
74,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[pats Stan on the back] Juvi Hall! [laughs heartily, then gloats] Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! [laughs heartily]"
75,6,16,Stan Marsh,[under his breath] God-damnit!
76,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters."
77,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?"
78,6,16,Stan Marsh,"I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him."
79,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success."
80,6,16,Stan Marsh,I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy! [gets off his seat and starts pacing the floor] Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
81,6,16,Butters Stotch,"I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too."
82,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's like everything I do, he... [stops and then looks at Butters] Wait a minute, what'd you say?"
83,6,16,Butters Stotch,"I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. [Stan is surprised by this account]"
84,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[after a moment] Dude, how long has your future self been around?"
85,6,16,Butters Stotch,Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
86,6,16,Stan Marsh,Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
87,6,16,Butters Stotch,Nobody asked.
88,6,16,Stan Marsh,Where is he now?
89,6,16,Butters Stotch,Probably watching Becker.
90,6,16,Becker,My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific. [laughs. Future Butters finds this quite funny. Stan and Butters enter the house to meet future Butters.]
91,6,16,Butters Stotch,"See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-"
92,6,16,Future Butters Stotch,Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always.
93,6,16,Linda Stotch,"[walks in with a plate holding a glass of water and a bottle] Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine."
94,6,16,Stan Marsh,Liver medicine?
95,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school. [an air of determination appears] I need to learn to behave myself! [Stan crosses his arms and gets mad, then bolts for the door] Hey! Where are you going, Stan? [follows Stan out.]"
96,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!"
97,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?"
98,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? [starts rifling through future Stan's clothes]"
99,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then."
100,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Here it is. [pulls out a wallet and reads the license. It's from the future, with LOSER printed in large letters on it and an expiration date of 10-19-2043] It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this? [pulls out a Motivation Corp. key card, expiring on 12/26/02] This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?"
101,6,16,Butters Stotch,I don't follow.
102,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[flips the card over to see the info on the other side] Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. [heads out the door.]"
103,6,16,Butters Stotch,[excitedly] Oh! Are we out for an adventure? [follows Stan out]
104,6,16,Stan Marsh,Here it is. Motivation Corp. [the camera pans up to show the name of the building. Stan puts the card into the reader next to the door. The door opens and Stan heads in.]
105,6,16,Butters Stotch,"[turns away. Stan stops right at the entrance] I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else."
106,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Butters] Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. [heads in]"
107,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? [follows Stan in and closes the door.]"
108,6,16,Stan Marsh,What the hell is going on here?
109,6,16,A voice,"It should take about a month to achieve the results you want. [Stan hears the voice and pulls Butters behind some bushes underneath the window. Stan peeks out over the bushes. The director appears with a couple ] Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to be very pleased with the results."
110,6,16,Mr Brooks,We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs.
111,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son."
112,6,16,Josh Casher,"Nice to meet you, ""Mom and Dad."" [they all laugh heartily]"
113,6,16,Mrs Brooks,"My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin."
114,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son."
115,6,16,Mr Casher,"I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass."
116,6,16,Mrs Brooks,"Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs."
117,6,16,Mr Brooks,"Heh it sure should, heh."
118,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Alright, then we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News."
119,6,16,Mr Brooks,"Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well?"
120,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,Motivation Corp. takes care of everything. [hands out some stapled sheets of paper] Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives.
121,6,16,Mrs Brooks,"[reads from her script] ""Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future."" Oh this is going to be fun."
122,6,16,Stan Marsh,I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
123,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I can't believe it!"
124,6,16,Stan Marsh,They've all been lying to us this whole time!
125,6,16,Butters Stotch,"This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this? [thinks about this a minute. Stan lowers his eyelids to half-closed as he realizes Butters is still clueless] Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject."
126,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[closes his eyes a bit, then] Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!"
127,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Eh, but then why did they come back to the past"
128,6,16,Stan Marsh,"They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!"
129,6,16,Butters Stotch,Oh... Oohhhh. [Stan rolls his eyes] But that's like they're lyin'
130,6,16,Stan Marsh,"It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!"
131,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!"
132,6,16,Stan Marsh,Who's that?
133,6,16,Butters Stotch,"You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!"
134,6,16,Stan Marsh,What?
135,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! [heads off. This time, Stan follows]"
136,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. [slides his closet door open, steps inside the closet, and slides the door shut]"
137,6,16,Stan Marsh,We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
138,6,16,Butters Stotch,[jumps out of the closet and cackles] Now you know my terrible secret!
139,6,16,Stan Marsh,"...You're gay? [Butters loses his moment] It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care."
140,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan."
141,6,16,Stan Marsh,"But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! [walks off]"
142,6,16,Butters Stotch,"[walks downtrodden to the mirror and looks at himself] Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver."
143,6,16,Butters Stotch,How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
144,6,16,Stan Marsh,"No, we gotta run away somewhere warm."
145,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Wow, look at this, Stan. [reads from the paper] ""Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."""
146,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[heading for the phone] Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. [picks up the phone receiver and starts punching in the numbers]"
147,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Hey look, somebody lost their pet."
148,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America? [listens for the answer] Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?"
149,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks."
150,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[still on the phone] Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please? [listens and writes down the address] Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?"
151,6,16,Butters Stotch,This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
152,6,16,Stan Marsh,Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you. [hangs up] That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
153,6,16,Butters Stotch,"[rises on his knees] Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too."
154,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Fine, then you can come with me. [heads out the door]"
155,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Hooray! [follows him out] And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them."
156,6,16,Stan Marsh,I guess this is it.
157,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?"
158,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[an egg-shaped chair is seen, with its back to the boys] Yes, come in, please. [the chair turns around, and Cartman appears seated on it.]"
159,6,16,Stan Marsh,Cartman??
160,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys."
161,6,16,Stan Marsh,What the hell are you doing here?!
162,6,16,Eric Cartman,"I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?"
163,6,16,Butters Stotch,You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
164,6,16,Stan Marsh,"God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. [both boys turn and walk towards the door]"
165,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then? [Stan and Butters stop in their tracks] Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?"
166,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[turns around] Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!"
167,6,16,Eric Cartman,"That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since."
168,6,16,Stan Marsh,How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
169,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. [Stan and Butters think a moment, then take seats before Cartman]"
170,6,16,Stan Marsh,Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
171,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[lets out a heavy sigh] God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?"
172,6,16,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
173,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way."
174,6,16,Stan Marsh,How much is this going to cost us?
175,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Eighteen thousand dollars. [Butters looks to Stan for guidance] How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five. [Stan still looks angry, Butters follows] How about five bucks?"
176,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding."
177,6,16,Randy Marsh,I think he's pretty scared alright.
178,6,16,Sharon Marsh,It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.
179,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking."
180,6,16,Sharon Marsh,Well that makes sense.
181,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism. [a shot of a marijuana leaf superimposed over the burning World Trade Center] Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means."
182,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us."
183,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here. [displays a few brochures and opens one] What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop."
184,6,16,Butters Stotch,Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
185,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. [displays some swatches with poop samples on them]"
186,6,16,Butters Stotch,Poop- poop swatches?
187,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents."
188,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?"
189,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Now, personally, I like the baby green. [switches to a new swatch] But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house."
190,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best."
191,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom."
192,6,16,Butters Stotch,Well that sounds good.
193,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice."
194,6,16,Butters Stotch,Hooray!
195,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school."
196,6,16,Stan Marsh,[brightly] Yeah.
197,6,16,Eric Cartman,"The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office."
198,6,16,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
199,6,16,Eric Cartman,Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
200,6,16,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
201,6,16,Eric Cartman,"And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. [Stan's excitement vanishes]"
202,6,16,Butters Stotch,Wow! Neato!
203,6,16,Stan Marsh,"That's not neato, that sucks."
204,6,16,Eric Cartman,What?
205,6,16,Stan Marsh,You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
206,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches."
207,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!"
208,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations. [throws the brochure away and gets some paper from inside the desk] Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog"
209,6,16,Stan Marsh,Dude!
210,6,16,Eric Cartman,Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
211,6,16,Stan Marsh,"No, that's too extreme!"
212,6,16,Eric Cartman,[sighs] Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
213,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! [leaves his seat and heads for the door.]"
214,6,16,Eric Cartman,"I'm a professional, suh! [watches Stan leave] Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied."
215,6,16,Stan Marsh,Hey future self.
216,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Yes, former self?"
217,6,16,Stan Marsh,"You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about? [future Stan looks at Stan as if the boy were crazy] You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?"
218,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh..."
219,6,16,Stan Marsh,You must know what I'm talking about.
220,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Sure uh, uh, [quickly rises from the table and walks toward the dining room entrance] oh man, could you all excuse me for a second? I think I'm gonna crap my pants. [leaves. Stan crosses his arms, quite annoyed]"
221,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Uh, Stan, [Randy stops eating his taco and looks at Stan] don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?"
222,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself."
223,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. [Sharon and Randy shift in their chairs]"
224,6,16,Randy Marsh,Oh. You. You don't?
225,6,16,Stan Marsh,"No. [plants his hands along the table's edge] You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax! [crosses his arms again] And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me! [uncrosses his arms] See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across."
226,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Well, you know what I think, Stan?"
227,6,16,Stan Marsh,What?
228,6,16,Randy Marsh,I think he IS from the future.
229,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, he must be. [Stan looks at them with eyebrows knitting] It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?"
230,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol."
231,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Right. [Stan looks at them with anger, then looks forward with anger]"
232,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe! [a painter descends from the small ladder he's on] The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!"
233,6,16,Felipe,"¿Qué? ¿La caca no esta aquí? [""What? The poop isn't here?""]"
234,6,16,Eric Cartman,"¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!"
235,6,16,Felipe,"¡Sí, sí señor! [""Yes, yes sir!""]"
236,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú? [looks in another part of the living room] ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we [sees a sponge on the floor and picks it up] spackle with the sponge. [dips the sponge into a poop tray and spackles the wall with it] See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado."
237,6,16,Carlos,"Sí. Marrado. [""Yes. Gently""]"
238,6,16,Eric Cartman,Marrado. Spectacularrr.
239,6,16,Carlos,Sí. [takes the sponge from Cartman and begins spackling]
240,6,16,Eric Cartman,"God, it's so hard to find good help. [runs into Butters, who has just entered the house] Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?"
241,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Boy, it sure is stinky in here!"
242,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice."
243,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-"
244,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I? [notices another worker] ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!"
245,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up- [the front door opens]"
246,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Oh, Stan! [Sharon and Future Stan look. Stan enters the dining room]"
247,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek?"
248,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[takes a seat at the table] Hide and go seek, huh?!"
249,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?"
250,6,16,Stan Marsh,I don't believe that he's my future self!
251,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?"
252,6,16,Stan Marsh,"No, I actually have a way to be sure. [whips out a meat cleaver in his right hand and places his left wrist on the table] I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear."
253,6,16,Sharon Marsh,[rises frantically] S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.
254,6,16,Stan Marsh,But I have to know for sure. [readies the cleaver]
255,6,16,Randy Marsh,"[stammers] Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. [Sharon is fearful]"
256,6,16,Stan Marsh,Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
257,6,16,Randy Marsh,Stan...
258,6,16,Stan Marsh,Yes?
259,6,16,Randy Marsh,Uh... nothing. Go ahead.
260,6,16,Sharon Marsh,Randy!
261,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[lowers the cleaver onto his wrist. The left hand falls away, and he lifts his left arm] AAAH! [a red area marks where the left hand was]"
262,6,16,Randy Marsh,AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look! [points. Stan looks behind his seat. Randy moves quickly to Future Stan and chops off his left hand. Blood spurts out. Stan faces the adults again as Future Stan screams in pain] What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
263,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!"
264,6,16,Stan Marsh,"That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake."
265,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Uh.. [tries to put Future Stan's back in place] Look, it was fake in the future, too. [Future Stan passes out in shock]"
266,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?"
267,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off."
268,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?"
269,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Ooo, ah, that's a different company. [the doorbell rings] Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!"
270,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Uh but Cartman! Wait! [once Cartman and crew leave, Butters faces the front door] Oh Christmas! [the door opens and Stan enters]"
271,6,16,Stan Marsh,Butters!
272,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, Stan!"
273,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here."
274,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden."
275,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Butters, we're running away!"
276,6,16,Butters Stotch,We are?
277,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! [Stephen, Linda, and future Butters enter with groceries]"
278,6,16,Stephen Stotch,What the hell is this?!
279,6,16,Linda Stotch,"Oh my God, our house!"
280,6,16,Butters Stotch,"[squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his hands] Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now"
281,6,16,Stephen Stotch,[both parents approach with hands on hips] Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!
282,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, not really sir, I just uh..."
283,6,16,Linda Stotch,"Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault."
284,6,16,Stephen Stotch,"What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son."
285,6,16,Stan Marsh,[watching his words fall apart] Huh?
286,6,16,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib."
287,6,16,Linda Stotch,We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
288,6,16,Stephen Stotch,"We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son! [starts crying as he and Linda hug Butters]"
289,6,16,Linda Stotch,"We're sorry, baby. [starts crying also. Butters, feeling the love, smiles, then grins.]"
290,6,16,Stan Marsh,Get the fuck out of here. [Randy and Sharon rush into the house]
291,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too."
292,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future."
293,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!"
294,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are."
295,6,16,Stan Marsh,"I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!"
296,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything."
297,6,16,Stan Marsh,"I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning."
298,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them"
299,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!"
300,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!"
301,6,16,Randy Marsh,"You really did a nice job, Eric. [Sharon holds a box of cookies]"
302,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby."
303,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present."
304,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become."
305,6,16,Future Eric Cartman,"[Future Cartman walks into the scene. His appearance is tall, fit, clean, handsome, and wearing a suit] Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice."
306,6,16,Eric Cartman,Who the hell are you?
307,6,16,Future Eric Cartman,"Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future. [genuflects] I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!"
308,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[sets the box of cookies down] Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!"
309,6,16,Future Eric Cartman,Right on!
310,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want! [The Marshes leave. He joins them] Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!"
311,6,16,Future Eric Cartman,"No, wait! [flashes of electricity runs through his body. His form becomes obese, dirty, and disheveled. His suit becomes an dirty open blue shirt over a dirty white shirt with a name tag. He also holds a tool box and a wrench] Oh, God-damnit!"
