0,6,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh, hello boys."
1,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again."
2,6,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh, but I thought your teacher died."
3,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay."
4,6,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. [turns and walks off]"
5,6,10,Tweek Tweak,Cartman likes to play with dolls?
6,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[strokes the lamb and sets it aside] Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious. [grabs a basket with a bottle of lotion sitting inside and lowers it down the hole. The basket stops when it reaches Polly Prissy Pants, which sits at the bottom of the hole] Now it takes the lotion from the basket."
7,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"[Cartman voicing] Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here."
8,6,10,Eric Cartman,It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
9,6,10,Poodle,[Cartman voicing] Bark bark bark bark!
10,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket."
11,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"Please, mister, let me out."
12,6,10,Eric Cartman,It puts the lotion back in the basket!
13,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"I miss my mom, mister. I wanna see my Mommy-"
14,6,10,Eric Cartman,[throws a fit] Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
15,6,10,Liane Cartman,Sweetie.
16,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes, mom?"
17,6,10,Liane Cartman,You have to get ready for school.
18,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[thinks a bit, then looks up] ...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?"
19,6,10,Liane Cartman,"Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back."
20,6,10,Eric Cartman,[pause] Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
21,6,10,Liane Cartman,"You'll get over it, honey."
22,6,10,Eric Cartman,[starts to throw another fit] But I wanna plaaayyy.
23,6,10,Wendy,I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? [Bebe walks in]
24,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Hey guys.
25,6,10,Wendy,Hey Bebe.
26,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"You guys, uh, [holds out her arms] notice anything different? [looks down at her body]"
27,6,10,Wendy,"[the three girls gaze] Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs!"
28,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away."
29,6,10,Mr Mackey,"[enters the classroom and walks past the girls] M'kay, kids, let's take our seats, m'kay? [the girls take their seats] I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?"
30,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?"
31,6,10,Mr Mackey,"No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems. [turns, grabs some chalk, and starts writing on the board] M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do, uh, four time four, m'kay?"
32,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look at Bebe. [""We'll move into the five times thing."" Bebe is busy taking notes. ""We'll try five time three...""] Something seems different about her."
33,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?"
34,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know. [Bebe continues writing]
35,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"Hey Token. You know, I never really noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool."
36,6,10,Token Black,"I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with."
37,6,10,Butters Stotch,"[pipes up behind Annie] Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? [Bebe continues writing]"
38,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?"
39,6,10,Craig Tucker,I don't know. Why?
40,6,10,Eric Cartman,It just... It just seems like a really awesome shirt.
41,6,10,Craig Tucker,"Yeah. It kinda does. [Bebe continues writing, but stops and looks to her right. All the boys are looking at her, all the girls look at the board.]"
42,6,10,Mr Mackey,"Okay, and so uh, [Bebe is looking back, wondering why the boys keep staring at her] so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?"
43,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"[breaks the stare and answers] Oh, uh, forty-eight?"
44,6,10,All the boys,Whoa.
45,6,10,Clyde Donovan,That is an awesome answer!
46,6,10,All the boys,Yeah!
47,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Bebe is really smart!
48,6,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
49,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, may be."
50,6,10,Wendy,"...And I was like, ""I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars."" [the girls stop and giggle]"
51,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[arriving with a group of boys: Kyle, Cartman, Token, Butters, Tweek, and Clyde] Ah, hey, Bebe."
52,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Yeah?
53,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us."
54,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Really? [Wendy and Red look at her] I've never done that before.
55,6,10,Butters Stotch,"[Stan and Kyle part a bit for a better view] Wuuhh, it's really fun. You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me."
56,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's cool."
57,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Well sure, that sounds hella fun."
58,6,10,The boys,Hahahahahaha...
59,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
60,6,10,Stan Marsh,Hella fun.
61,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Right, heh."
62,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"Wow, hella fun. That's awesome."
63,6,10,Token Black,I'm gonna start saying that now.
64,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Cool. [the boys turn as one and walk back the way they came] We'll see you later, Bebe."
65,6,10,Wendy,"[Wendy catches up to Stan. The boys are grinning. Stan stops and looks] Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys."
66,6,10,Stan Marsh,"That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. [turns and walks off]"
67,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,[looks over his shoulder] Yeah. She's really cool. [Wendy gets upset]
68,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"It's weird how we never noticed before. [Wendy looks back at Bebe, who just shrugs]"
69,6,10,Stan Marsh,"So what you do, see, is you wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. [he throws a rock towards the road and the others look at the trajectory. A blue pick-up truck drives by and is hit]"
70,6,10,Driver,You damn kids!
71,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Cool.
72,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"You try it, Bebe."
73,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Okay.
74,6,10,Token Black,Here comes a sedan. [Bebe throws a rock at the red sedan and hits it]
75,6,10,Driver,You damn kids!
76,6,10,The boys,Awesome!
77,6,10,Butters Stotch,Cool! [close up] That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
78,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"That was sweet, Bebe. [shows her another rock and another grip] Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-"
79,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah. [grabs a hold of the rock and pulls it a bit] Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-"
80,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,[pulls back] I'm showing her.
81,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"[pulls back] Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-"
82,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[gives an ape look and smacks Clyde, who lets go of the rock] Hoh!"
83,6,10,Clyde Donovan,[grunts back and moves off] Hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe is stunned at this development]
84,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh! [watches, then reverts to normal and talks to Bebe. Stan moves in] Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-"
85,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[grabs the rock and demonstrates] Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-"
86,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[peeved] Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe backs up, scared]"
87,6,10,Stan Marsh,Hoh hoh hoh!
88,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hah hah hah!
89,6,10,Craig Tucker,[beats his chest] Urh urh urh! [all the boys start grunting and displaying aggression]
90,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Uh. Listen guys, um, it's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. [leaves. The boys continue grunting and putting on displays. She walks faster the farther she moves from the boys. The boys notice her absence and stop.]"
91,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[beat] ...Wait, what were we doing again?"
92,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,We were throwing rocks at cars.
93,6,10,The boys,Oh yeah.
94,6,10,Eric Cartman,Woohoo.
95,6,10,Butters Stotch,[points] Uh there comes an SUV. [Token throws a rock and hits the SUV]
96,6,10,Jimbo Kern,You damn kids!
97,6,10,The boys,"Hi, Bebe."
98,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Hey everybody.
99,6,10,Wendy,"[rolls her eyes and rests her head on her right hand] Oh, for Christ's sake!"
100,6,10,Mr Mackey,"[arriving, puts his textbooks on the teacher's desk] M'kay. Kids, yesterday I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who wants to start? [Clyde raises his hand] M'kay, Clyde?"
101,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"[picks up his paper and starts] My paper is called, ""Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever""."
102,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, that's what I wrote about!"
103,6,10,Butters Stotch,Me too!
104,6,10,Clyde Donovan,[grunts] Hoh!
105,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[grunts and pounds his desk] Hah hah, hah! [the other boys start grunting like apes]"
106,6,10,Mr Mackey,"Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde."
107,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"[glowers at Stan, then reads] ""My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end."" [some applause]"
108,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper?"
109,6,10,Token Black,"[picks up his paper and reads] ""If I could be Bebe."" [Wendy is miffed and rolls her eyes] ""If I was Bebe, I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."""
110,6,10,Mr Mackey,"[takes a moment to think, then] M'kay, interesting, Token. Uh... Who would like to go next? [the rest of the boys raise their hands energetically and make small sounds to get Mackey's attention] Uh, how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is?"
111,6,10,The boys,[softly] Oh. [they lower their hands. Bebe raises hers]
112,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, Bebe?"
113,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"[picks up her paper and reads] ""My cat Thumper."""
114,6,10,The boys,Wwooww.
115,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"[sees the reaction and continues reading] ""Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail."" [the boys break out in laughter]"
116,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Chase his tail? That must be so funny!
117,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"""Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."""
118,6,10,The boys,Wwooww!
119,6,10,Eric Cartman,"God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone."
120,6,10,Craig Tucker,"That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet."
121,6,10,Stan Marsh,That's such a great paper! [starts clapping. The other boys join in the applause]
122,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?"
123,6,10,Wendy,"[picks up her paper and reads] ""The new Cold War."""
124,6,10,Eric Cartman,Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! [the boys crack up]
125,6,10,Wendy,"But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-"
126,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"[arrives with Kyle, Token, Craig, Bradley, and Francis] Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?"
127,6,10,Wendy,[angrily] No!
128,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe she's in the lunch line.
129,6,10,The boys,Yeah.
130,6,10,Wendy,Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
131,6,10,Millie Larsen,I can't stand her anymore! She's such a slut!
132,6,10,Esther,She's a total slut!
133,6,10,Red,You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.
134,6,10,Millie Larsen,I heard that she lifted her shirt to the boys at the bus stop.
135,6,10,Wendy,"I heard that her asshole is this big around. [makes a hole with her hands, thumb touching thumb, the other fingers touching their counterparts on the other hand]"
136,6,10,Millie and Esther,Wwooww.
137,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[comes into view] Hey guys.
138,6,10,Wendy,"Oh, hey Bebe. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut."
139,6,10,Millie Larsen,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
140,6,10,Esther,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
141,6,10,Millie Larsen,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
142,6,10,Bebe Stevens,...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
143,6,10,Wendy,"Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut."
144,6,10,Millie Larsen,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
145,6,10,Esther,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
146,6,10,Red,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
147,6,10,Wendy,Slut.
148,6,10,Millie Larsen,"[fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [the girls take their trays and leave, giggling]"
149,6,10,Girls,[out of view] Whore. Slut. Slut.
150,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Bebe, is something the matter?"
151,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"[turns and faces her mom] Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today. [faces the window again and rests her head on her right hand] They called me a ""slut with a huge gaping vagina""."
152,6,10,Bebe s Mom,"[approaches] Oh, sweetie. You're all just growing up. [begins to stroke Bebe's hair] Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next."
153,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool."
154,6,10,Bebe s Mom,"I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family."
155,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine! [rests her head on her hands] Guys are way cooler, anyways."
156,6,10,Tweek Tweak,[arrives] You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
157,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk."
158,6,10,Tweek Tweak,[sits next to Cartman] Oh God.
159,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[offers Tweek his plate] Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met."
160,6,10,Stan Marsh,True.
161,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,True.
162,6,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
163,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yep.
164,6,10,Eric Cartman,"And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process."
165,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Right.
166,6,10,Stan Marsh,Uh huh.
167,6,10,Eric Cartman,"And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend."
168,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
169,6,10,Stan Marsh,That would be best.
170,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you."
171,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Huh??
172,6,10,Stan Marsh,Kyle??
173,6,10,Eric Cartman,"And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts]"
174,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!"
175,6,10,Eric Cartman,"And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip."
176,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!"
177,6,10,Eric Cartman,Pleeeeease???
178,6,10,Stan Marsh,No!
179,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[removes the watch and peanuts] Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that it's been really fun. Here's a watch and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts again]"
180,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,No way! Tweek's cool!
181,6,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
182,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?"
183,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
184,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Sure thing, Bebe."
185,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[arrives] That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan! [leaves, then returns] Fuck you, Tweek! [leaves, then returns] Bebe, you're still cool. [leaves again]"
186,6,10,Wendy,What are you doing?!
187,6,10,Clyde Donovan,We're trying to get Bebe to run for class president.
188,6,10,Wendy,I'm class president! The vote was last fall!
189,6,10,Craig Tucker,"Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you."
190,6,10,Token Black,[gushing] Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.
191,6,10,The Other Boys,Uh huh.
192,6,10,Wendy,"She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! [the boys just look at her]"
193,6,10,Clyde Donovan,What?
194,6,10,Wendy,"Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! [walks away in a funk]"
195,6,10,Butters Stotch,[puts his fists on his hips] Stupider than Bebe!
196,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Yeah!
197,6,10,Craig Tucker,Yeah!
198,6,10,Butters Stotch,"Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?"
199,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Yeah!
200,6,10,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
201,6,10,Craig Tucker,Sure is!
202,6,10,Butters Stotch,Uhyep.
203,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
204,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. [they arrive, but find four other boys arriving at the same time: Timmy, Kevin, Bradley, and Francis] Where are you guys going?"
205,6,10,Bradley Biggle,We're going to see our friend Bebe.
206,6,10,Stan Marsh,Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
207,6,10,Francis,Bebe is everybody's friend.
208,6,10,Kevin Stoley,Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives.
209,6,10,Stan Marsh,[steps forward and grunts] Hoh!
210,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,[steps forward and grunts] Hoh hoh hoh!
211,6,10,Kevin Stoley,Arf arf!
212,6,10,Francis,Arf! [a few more grunts are heard]
213,6,10,Timmy Burch,Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!
214,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. [goes and knocks on the door]"
215,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Oh, hello, boys."
216,6,10,Stan Marsh,Is Bebe home?
217,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait."
218,6,10,Bradley Biggle,Who is she with?
219,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"I believe she is playing ""Lambs"" over at Eric Cartman's house."
220,6,10,Stan Marsh,Cartman's?
221,6,10,Eric Cartman,[holds up the poodle] And this is Precious.
222,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Precious?
223,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[squeezes the poodle] Bark bark bark. [sets the poodle aside] Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket [puts the lotion in the basket] and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. [the basket descends]"
224,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[watches the basket drop] Uh huh. [the basket stops once again in front of Polly Prissy Pants]
225,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."""
226,6,10,Bebe Stevens,It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
227,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Heheh, yeah."
228,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"Mister, please let me out of here."
229,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Now say it again, louder."
230,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[louder] It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
231,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!"
232,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!"
233,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"""
234,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Put the lotion in the basket!
235,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Put the lotion in the fucking basket! [pushes the rubber poodle into the hole] Oh no! Precious! [does Polly's voice] I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it! [a door is heard opening and Kyle goes down the steps, followed by Stan, Kevin, Craig, Clyde, Butters, Francis, Tweek, Bradley, Token, Pip, and Timmy] Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"""
236,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Don't you hurt my fucking dog!
237,6,10,Eric Cartman,"You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- [stops when he hears Timmy's wheelchair and looks around]"
238,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing?
239,6,10,Eric Cartman,"We're playing ""Lambs."""
240,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[moves over to Bebe] Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today."
241,6,10,Butters Stotch,[moves forward] Then we gotta work on your campaign.
242,6,10,Francis,"[moves forward] Right, but first we gotta go to the-"
243,6,10,Stan Marsh,[jumps in front of Boy 2] Hoh! [the other boys begin to grunt and face each other]
244,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"You guys, calm down!"
245,6,10,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
246,6,10,Bebe Stevens,This is insane!
247,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Stop it you guys, please!"
248,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble!"
249,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[atop a pile of boys] Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! [he's knocked them all out and tossed them into a mound]"
250,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out."
251,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"I know. They've been there all day. [Outside, Token messes with a trash can. Cartman notices and walks over, pushing the trash can down. Stan plays with a rock on the steps. Craig inches his way towards Stan, who watches him from time to time, and Francis is up a tree.]"
252,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!"
253,6,10,Craig Tucker,"Hah hah hahah hah! [the other boys turn and start grunting. Stan chases Craig away from the steps, then returns to sitting there.]"
254,6,10,Stan Marsh,Hoh hoh hoh! [picks up his rock and plays with it] Hohohoh hoh!
255,6,10,Mrs Stevens,Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.
256,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?"
257,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman."
258,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters."
259,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart. [gives her a hug and then leaves]"
260,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Mom? [her mom stops and turns around] What's six times eight?
261,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers. [satisfied, she turns around and walks out and downstairs. She opens the front door and the boys back away grunting] Alright boys, time to be getting home. Bebe's not feeling well and she can't come out today. Go one, shoo. [the boys walk away slowly, grunting in disappointment. A whistling sound is heard and a space shuttle crashes into a field across the street. The boys stop at the sight.]"
262,6,10,Stan Marsh,Hoh. Hoh?
263,6,10,Astronaut 1,Aah. We made it.
264,6,10,Astronaut 2,"Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us? [the boys start to grunt again. Stan backs up into the crowd of boys]"
265,6,10,Astronaut 1,Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over!
266,6,10,Astronaut 2,"I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?!"
267,6,10,Astronaut 1,"I don't want to live in this futuristic madness! [pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]"
268,6,10,Astronaut 2,"Take your ape rule and go to hell! [pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]"
269,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[sighs] Having boobs sucks.
270,6,10,A Doctor,"Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today? [sits at his desk]"
271,6,10,Bebe Stevens,I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. [the doctor leans forwards and visually inspects Bebe's chest]
272,6,10,Dr Hallis,You?
273,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
274,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age."
275,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
276,6,10,Dr Hallis,Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.
277,6,10,Bebe Stevens,I think it's insane to want them bigger.
278,6,10,Dr Hallis,Why do you... hate your breasts so?
279,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
280,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Oh, come on now, that's just silly."
281,6,10,Blonde Nurse,"[nice shape, walks in with a folder] Here's the Anderson file, Doctor."
282,6,10,Dr Hallis,"[looks up, looks down and grins, then looks up again] Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thanks you so much. [The nurse walks out. Bebe lowers her eyelids halfway]"
283,6,10,Brunette Nurse,"[not as nicely shaped, walks in with a cup and plate] And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor."
284,6,10,Dr Hallis,"[quickly, subdued, looks askance] Yeah, whatever. Get out of here. [the nurse walks out, and he addresses Bebe again] Now, I was saying?"
285,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want."
286,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?"
287,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero."
288,6,10,Dr Hallis,"That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl."
289,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Damnit!
290,6,10,Dr Hallis,"If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?"
291,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Oh, fuck off! [walks off in disgust]"
292,6,10,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?"
293,6,10,Randy Marsh,Why? What's the matter with him?
294,6,10,Sharon Marsh,"It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. [Randy looks. In the living room Stan has taken out his crayons and drawn some figures on the wall]"
295,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[disheveled, in his primal state] Aaaa-ta. [starts drawing another boob. The wall is covered with them, singly or in pairs. One stick-figure woman has a large pair] Aaaa-ta."
296,6,10,Sharon Marsh,"He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why."
297,6,10,Stan Marsh,[picks up a stick and moves it around] Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
298,6,10,Randy Marsh,Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
299,6,10,Sharon Marsh,[relieved and proud] Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. [Randy leaves his seat at the table and approaches Stan]
300,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[points to the wall with his stick] Ahta. Ah, ahta!"
301,6,10,Randy Marsh,"Hey there, son."
302,6,10,Stan Marsh,[turns to face his father] Hoh? Ahta. [points to the wall] Ahta.
303,6,10,Randy Marsh,"Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan."
304,6,10,Stan Marsh,Ahta.
305,6,10,Randy Marsh,"Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ""ahta"" will start becoming a major part of your life."
306,6,10,Stan Marsh,Ahta? [Sharon walks behind Randy and sits on one of the sofa's arms]
307,6,10,Randy Marsh,"But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever."
308,6,10,Stan Marsh,[considers each argument] Friend. Ahta.
309,6,10,Randy Marsh,"I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday, [places his left hand on Sharon's right shoulder. She smiles] you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most."
310,6,10,Sharon Marsh,[putting her right arm around Randy] I love you.
311,6,10,Randy Marsh,"If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all."
312,6,10,Right Breast,The boys are at war. All is going as planned.
313,6,10,Left Breast,Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees.
314,6,10,Right Breast,We grow larger every day.
315,6,10,Left Breast,And stronger.
316,6,10,Right Breast,Soon the entire tow- [Bebe awakens]
317,6,10,Left Breast,Sh! Sh! She's awake!
318,6,10,Right Breast,"Ah, quiet."
319,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[shrieks and kicks her blanket off] MOM!! MOM!!
320,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"[rushes to Bebe's room and enters] What is it, Bebe?"
321,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[scared] My breasts!
322,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"[approaches the bed, sits, and holds her] Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady."
323,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!"
324,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"[beat] Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You're blossoming into a woman. [hugs her]"
325,6,10,Bebe Stevens,That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
326,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?"
327,6,10,Wendy,Yes! I want to get breast implants!
328,6,10,Mrs Testaburger,I tried to tell her she was too young.
329,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant."
330,6,10,Mrs Testaburger,[considers the doctor's argument...] But she's eight!
331,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty."
332,6,10,Wendy,That's what I said.
333,6,10,Dr Hallis,"However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone. [takes out a notepad] I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go."
334,6,10,Wendy,"I have three thousand dollars, cash. [her mom blanches]"
335,6,10,Dr Hallis,"[quickly disposes of the pad and pen, then rises and leaves the desk] You pass. Let's do this thing."
336,6,10,Mrs Testaburger,"[mortified] Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now?"
337,6,10,Dr Hallis,Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure. [holds Wendy's right arm up and points to the armpit] What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.
338,6,10,Mrs Testaburger,I still don't know about this.
339,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?"
340,6,10,Dr Hallis,"[shove] Cha! [shove] Gotta! [shove] Jam it! [shove] Up there! [shove] Get! [shove] In! [shove] There! [shove] You! [shove] Bitch! [shoves faster] Get! [shove] In! [shove] There! [shove] You! [shove] Bitch! [the implant is finally in place; everything is covered in blood] Hah! [wipes his brow] Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great."
341,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades."
342,6,10,Clyde Donovan,[in primal mode] Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! [he and a few others grunt a bit]
343,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay? [the grunts start up again]"
344,6,10,Bradley Biggle,Bebe! [more grunts.]
345,6,10,Stan Marsh,Ahta! [more grunts. Bebe enters wearing a cardboard box over her clothes. The boys quiet down.]
346,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Hey guys. [a few boys grunt back with ""Hi!!"" ""Hey."" ""Hm."" as she heads for her seat. The boys are confused.]"
347,6,10,Craig Tucker,Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? [Bebe smiles at her uncoolness]
348,6,10,Token Black,Yeah. What the hell happened to us?
349,6,10,Stan Marsh,Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
350,6,10,Eric Cartman,Bebe's boobs?
351,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Oh cool! It worked!
352,6,10,Stan Marsh,Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
353,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
354,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Yes!
355,6,10,Eric Cartman,"So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?"
356,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.
357,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
358,6,10,Stan Marsh,"I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us."
359,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!
360,6,10,Craig Tucker,"I'm sorry for fighting, you guys. [all the boys leave their seats and start apologizing to each other, hugging each other]"
361,6,10,Mr Mackey,"[moved by this display of affection] Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?"
362,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Let's never let boobs come between us again!
363,6,10,The Boys,Hear Hear!
364,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Boobs are stupid!
365,6,10,Wendy,"[enters with her new, ample implants] Hi, everybody. [the boys look at her for a long while, then start laughing heartily. Wendy is stunned at the response]"
366,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Look at those ridiculous things!
367,6,10,Butters Stotch,"[steps up and touches the left breast] Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!"
368,6,10,Eric Cartman,"What a stupid bitch! [the boys start laughing again. Butters is laughing hard, but realizes that his finger is still on Wendy's breast.]"
