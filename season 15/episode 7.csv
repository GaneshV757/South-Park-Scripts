0,15,7,Boys,Yay! [Liane sits next to Cartman with a camera of her own]
1,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright now, open presents! Open presents!"
2,15,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! [Stan reaches over and opens it]
3,15,7,Eric Cartman,Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
4,15,7,Liane Cartman,"[reaches under the table and gives Cartman a gift] Here you go, sweetie."
5,15,7,Eric Cartman,Yaaaay!
6,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
7,15,7,Liane Cartman,"Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too. [in a softer voice] Otherwise, he gets a little upset."
8,15,7,Eric Cartman,[eagerly opening his own gift] What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
9,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God...
10,15,7,Stan Marsh,"[opening his gift] Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters."
11,15,7,Butters Stotch,I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
12,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox! [Speed Zone for XBOX 360] D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?"
13,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Here, this one's from me, Stan."
14,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh thanks, dude."
15,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Stan's getting another present, Mom."
16,15,7,Liane Cartman,"Here you are, muffin. [throws up another gift]"
17,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Yaaaay! [rips the wrapper off] Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?"
18,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?"
19,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah dude!
20,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"[walks up behind Stan] Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?"
21,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah they're the best!
22,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff."
23,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Mom, I'm 10 years old now."
24,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy."
25,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?"
26,15,7,Randy Marsh,Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
27,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about."
28,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Well, do you really think we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?"
29,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!"
30,15,7,Randy Marsh,Tween Wave?
31,15,7,Sharon Marsh,You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
32,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?"
33,15,7,Sharon Marsh,This is different!
34,15,7,Randy Marsh,[waits a few seconds] ...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
35,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"[stops washing and turns around] It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better."
36,15,7,Randy Marsh,"[mimicking an elderly man] ""Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."""
37,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Fine, Randy! [hands him the CD] You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! [goes back to washing dishes]"
38,15,7,Randy Marsh,"I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. [walks out and towards his den.]"
39,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Well, it sounds like crap, right?!"
40,15,7,Randy Marsh,Uh... NO I mean... [looks at Sharon] I like it.
41,15,7,Sharon Marsh,Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
42,15,7,Randy Marsh,"No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon."
43,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!"
44,15,7,Randy Marsh,"It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! [turns towards the computer. Sharon walks away exasperated. Randy clicks his fingers, but the farts noises keep coming and Randy keeps wincing]"
45,15,7,Anchorman,"It's called Tween Wave, and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it. A new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012. or ""The Tweens."" Every generation has their music, but many parents say Tween Wave sounds like crap."
46,15,7,Man 1 and Wife,"It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good."
47,15,7,Woman 1,This sounds like poo.
48,15,7,Man 2,[an elderly man] I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.
49,15,7,Anchorman,Kids however say they don't hear crap at all.
50,15,7,Kid 1,Parents are dumb.
51,15,7,Kid 2,They don't get it.
52,15,7,Kid 1,They don't get it. Parents are stupid.
53,15,7,Kid 3,Tween Wave is swick.
54,15,7,Kid 4,"Tweem Wave is super swick and parents don't get it, 'cause their ears are old."
55,15,7,Kid 5,Parents are dumb.
56,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music."
57,15,7,Randy Marsh,"[sitting with the boys] Ugh, that's so unfair!"
58,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,But that's our music! We like it!
59,15,7,Randy Marsh,Yeah it's good!
60,15,7,Sheila Broflovski,What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
61,15,7,Stan Marsh,We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
62,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us."
63,15,7,Gerald Broflovski,"I wanna educate you kids with some real music. [pops in a CD of The Police's ""Synchronicity""] This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. [presses Play and ""Every Breath You Take"" starts up, but instead of lyrics you hear poop sounds]"
64,15,7,The Boys,Yuck!
65,15,7,Randy Marsh,What?
66,15,7,Stan Marsh,That sounds like shit!
67,15,7,Gerald Broflovski,Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
68,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Gross!
69,15,7,Eric Cartman,Turn it off dude!
70,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you."
71,15,7,Stan Marsh,"I know, Mom. I love you too."
72,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff."
73,15,7,Stan Marsh,"It's okay, Mom. I understand."
74,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. [Stan turns away and closes his eyes.]"
75,15,7,Stan Marsh,"'Night. [Sharon turns off the lights and closes the door. A few seconds later, Stan opens his eyes and looks at the door to make sure his mom isn't looking at him. Then he reaches under the mattress and pulls out his iPod] Haha. [listens to some music. Soon some shitty sounds creep in] Ugh. [tries some other tracks, but each one has poop noises in it. He sits up] What the hell? [tries more tracks, but all he hears now is shit]"
76,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Cartman] Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! [has Cartman listen to his song]"
77,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, that one's cool. [gets into the rhythm] Yeah, this part's killer. [looks like he's exercising]"
78,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,[seeing Stan approach] Hey Stan. [hands Cartman his iPod]
79,15,7,Stan Marsh,Hey dudes.
80,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite."
81,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?"
82,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Sure. [they walk off to a small clearing] What's up?
83,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle."
84,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
85,15,7,Stan Marsh,"No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me."
86,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Why? What's it sound like?
87,15,7,Stan Marsh,It... kind of sounds like shit.
88,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?"
89,15,7,Stan Marsh,"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close. [has Kyle listen to a track] You don't hear shit?"
90,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,No.
91,15,7,Stan Marsh,That doesn't sound like shit to you?
92,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor."
93,15,7,Stan Marsh,"And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me."
94,15,7,Doctor,"Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?"
95,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit."
96,15,7,Doctor,[reads his medical file] This says you had a birthday recently?
97,15,7,Stan Marsh,I just turned 10.
98,15,7,Doctor,"Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes."
99,15,7,Stan Marsh,So this is normal?
100,15,7,Doctor,"It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear. [plays some music, with lots of fart sounds] What's that sound like to you?"
101,15,7,Stan Marsh,Sounds like shit.
102,15,7,Doctor,Aha. Now I'm going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan. [plays a Dylan track. Dylan gets through three syllables before fart sounds replace him.]
103,15,7,Stan Marsh,Uh that sounds like shit too.
104,15,7,Doctor,"Wait, this sounds like shit to you?"
105,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, it's just shit."
106,15,7,Doctor,"Well that's very strange. [turns off the player] Hm, I'm gonna try somethin' else. [takes two pictures up to Stan] Look at these two pictures. One of them is an ad for Kevin James' new movie The Zookeeper, and the other is a turd in a microwave. Which one is the ad for The Zookeeper?"
107,15,7,Stan Marsh,"They both look the same. [true enough, except for the turds]"
108,15,7,Doctor,You don't see any difference in the pictures?
109,15,7,Stan Marsh,No.
110,15,7,Doctor,[holds up the picture in his right hand] That is an ad for The Zookeeper and [holds up the picture in his left hand] that is a turd about to be reheated.
111,15,7,Stan Marsh,They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
112,15,7,Doctor,"Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called ""being a cynical asshole."""
113,15,7,Stan Marsh,Oh no.
114,15,7,Doctor,"Yes. And there's no known cure, I'm afraid. Everything just seems shitty, and everyone starts to seem shitty, and everything they say just starts to [sounds shitty now, and Stan can't believe his ears. Soon, shit comes out of the doctor's mouth and Stan is more horrified]"
115,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"[walking by] Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?"
116,15,7,Randy Marsh,Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
117,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!"
118,15,7,Randy Marsh,No it doesn't sound like crap to me! [one pooping sound and the headphones are off] Ugh. [gets up and walks around angrily]
119,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called ""getting older"", Randy. It's okay."
120,15,7,Randy Marsh,"That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!"
121,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!"
122,15,7,Randy Marsh,Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
123,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake. [presses the play button] A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control! [fart noises, courtesy of his own butt] I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow [more fart noises. A janitor listens in] I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. [more fart noises.]"
124,15,7,Bar Patron,You suck!
125,15,7,Randy Marsh,"No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! [more fart noises.]"
126,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
127,15,7,Two Farmers/Janitor/Farmer 1 and Farmer 2,"Nah, I'd a heard that."
128,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
129,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,What fer?
130,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style. [sniffs] It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
131,15,7,Two Farmers/Janitor/Farmer 1 and Farmer 2,You mean that guy that plays the blues and died in an airplane crash?
132,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
133,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!"
134,15,7,Kenny McCormick,(Get him!)
135,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?"
136,15,7,Eric Cartman,"He's lying, dude. Hit X"
137,15,7,Kenny McCormick,"(No, he's telling the truth) [Stan walks in]"
138,15,7,Stan Marsh,Hey guys.
139,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?"
140,15,7,Stan Marsh,He said I have cynicism?
141,15,7,Eric Cartman,What's that?
142,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit."
143,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire."
144,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?"
145,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle."
146,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we got him!"
147,15,7,Stan Marsh,How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
148,15,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Hit the X button, Kyle!)"
149,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna level up to detective!
150,15,7,Stan Marsh,That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
151,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?"
152,15,7,Stan Marsh,"[looking at his chocolate sundae] Aw, dude, this looks like shit."
153,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,You don't wanna eat it?
154,15,7,Stan Marsh,"It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit."
155,15,7,Eric Cartman,Look like ice cream to me.
156,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?"
157,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit."
158,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?"
159,15,7,Stan Marsh,"What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever."
160,15,7,Randy Marsh,"City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much [puts the mic to his ass and farts into it]"
161,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"Lord, I ain't never seen britches take a whoopin' like that."
162,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
163,15,7,Randy Marsh,"City bop! City yeah! [more fart sounds, and the song ends] Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks."
164,15,7,Steamy Nicks,"[sounding a lot like a goat] Thank you, thank you so much. [Randy presses play and a song begins]"
165,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"Wait now, who's that lady?"
166,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,That there's Steamy Nicks.
167,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"You mean that gal who played for Fleetwood Mac and wrote that song ""Landslide""?"
168,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,"Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. [sure enough, she does this, and Randy joins her a second later]"
169,15,7,Randy Marsh,Yoyoyo! [more fart sounds]
170,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"[enters the bowling alley and heads straight for Randy] Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!"
171,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
172,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,Them britches have had enough!
173,15,7,Waitress,All alone today?
174,15,7,Stan Marsh,Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
175,15,7,Waitress,"Well, what can I get you?"
176,15,7,Stan Marsh,Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
177,15,7,Waitress,"A little young to be so pessimistic, aren't ya kid?"
178,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. [just outside, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny walk by, not noticing Stan in the diner. Stan, on the other hand, notices them walk by. He quickly leaves the booth and catches up with them outside, where they're happily talking about something.]"
179,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,[laughing] I know! That's so hilarious!
180,15,7,Stan Marsh,I thought you guys were sick! [the other boys don't know what to say]
181,15,7,Eric Cartman,"...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. [Cartman and Kenny turn and walk away. Stan approaches Kyle]"
182,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you totally lied to me!"
183,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-"
184,15,7,Stan Marsh,Where were you guys going?!
185,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright dude, we were going to the movies."
186,15,7,Stan Marsh,Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
187,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!"""
188,15,7,Stan Marsh,You guys... don't wanna be around me?
189,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time."
190,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you."
191,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinks about it, then sighs] Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain."
192,15,7,Stan Marsh,I won't say a word.
193,15,7,Stan Marsh,Oh shit.
194,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! [apparently trailers are still playing]"
195,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh cool, the movie trailers!"
196,15,7,Announcer,"Adam Sandler is Jack. Adam Sandler is Jill. [Jack and Jill are at a well, and Jill poops on Jack... and they both look like turds]"
197,15,7,Stan Marsh,Awww God! [squeezes his eyes shut and puts his hand over them]
198,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!"
199,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry."
200,15,7,Announcer,"[a toilet bowl spews out shit] This November, Adam Sandler shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth. [Some eyes, ear, and mouth are shown separately, and poop lands on each of them] It's Adam Sandler in Pbbbbbt, rated Arg for pirates. Fuck you!"
201,15,7,Eric Cartman,That looks pretty good.
202,15,7,Stan Marsh,How can you say that looks good?!
203,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Shhh, you're doing it again!"
204,15,7,Announcer,"Jim Carrey has a bunch of turds in his apartment. [dancing turds that create turd sounds, at that]"
205,15,7,Stan Marsh,[shields his eyes from the shit] Ugh.
206,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Stan, knock it off!"
207,15,7,Stan Marsh,But it's just crap.
208,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, they're penguins! Stop it!"
209,15,7,Announcer,"[shots of Carrey carrying two turds, slipping on another turd, then taking a crap while two turds look on] It's Jim Carrey in Whatever, You'll Pay To Go See It. Fuck you! July 12."
210,15,7,Announcer,"The President of the United States... is a duck?? [the duck pops up and opens its beak, which issues forth lots of shit] A duck is President and the whole country is goin' to the dogs. [two dogs are shown. One of them has his ass to the camera, and it begins to poop] Or whatever, the President is a dog. [the dog and duck now stand before a U.S. flag] Who cares? Coming June something. [a bunch of poop hits the scene, landing on the dog and duck and spelling out ""JUNE""]"
211,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh come on, people!"
212,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! [leaves his seat and walks out. Kenny and Cartman follow suit]"
213,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry."
214,15,7,Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude."
215,15,7,Stan Marsh,Me?! Did you see that shit?!
216,15,7,Stan Marsh,Hang on guys!
217,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! [he and Kenny leave. Kyle stays behind]"
218,15,7,Stan Marsh,Kyle?
219,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around] Dude, you've... you've changed."
220,15,7,Stan Marsh,"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?"
221,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- [poop starts coming out of his mouth and spewing all over the place. He then turns into a huge turd - this is how Stan sees him. The rest of us see him normally. Stan turns and walks away. Kyle turns and walks away in the opposite direction]"
222,15,7,Randy Marsh,"You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!"
223,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!"
224,15,7,Randy Marsh,"I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!"
225,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"... You're 42 years old, Randy!"
226,15,7,Randy Marsh,"I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!"
227,15,7,Sharon Marsh,Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
228,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,What do you suppose is goin' on in there?
229,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
230,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,You... sure you wanna do this?
231,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,"We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches."
232,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! [the two men slide a side window up ever so quietly, go in, and sneak upstairs]"
233,15,7,Randy Marsh,Why can't you ever just support me?!
234,15,7,Sharon Marsh,Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!
235,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!"
236,15,7,Sharon Marsh,WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
237,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! [Sharon reflects on this for a moment and her voice goes soft]"
238,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous."
239,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,"[the two men sneak out the way they came in] Come on britches, we're settin' you free."
240,15,7,Randy Marsh,I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
241,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me."
242,15,7,Randy Marsh,You kind of seem shitty to me too.
243,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"People get older, Randy. People grow apart."
