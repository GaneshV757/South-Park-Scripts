0,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Last week the students of this school participated in the Presidential Fitness Test. I'm sad to announce that South Park Elementary scored the lowest in health and fitness in the entire country. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] On the whole, you students actually scored fine. But the President's Fitness Test is scored on a school-wide average, and one fourth grader at this school scored so low, with a terrifying body fat score, [Cartman knows the man is talking about him], and high blood pressure and the cholesterol levels of a seventy-year-old man, that it actually brought you entire school's average down to the lowest in the country. [Cartman yawns] However, the Presidential Fitness Program never wants to single out one child, because then that child might feel bad. And so as far as we're concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs."
1,15,12,Principal Victoria,"Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?"
2,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Sorry. As far as the board is concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs. And so it is the recommendation of this board that every week, each class will alternate turns, giving up their recesses and instead reporting to PE."
3,15,12,School Assembly,AWWW!
4,15,12,PE Coach,"Alright, fourth grade class, you're up first. We're gonna do some rope-climbin'."
5,15,12,Stan Marsh,God this sucks!
6,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,Four weeks we gotta do this?
7,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. [Stan, Kyle, and some other kids are not amused]"
8,15,12,PE Coach,"Alright McCormick, let's start with you. Climb the rope. [Kenny approaches the rope, jumps up, and starts climbing]"
9,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. [Kenny climbs down and Kyle approaches]"
10,15,12,PE Coach,"Alright, let's go Broflovski. [Kyle jumps on and starts climbing]"
11,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?"
12,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!"
13,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us."
14,15,12,Stan Marsh,Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
15,15,12,Craig Tucker,Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
16,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip."
17,15,12,Wendy Testaburger,"We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!"
18,15,12,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
19,15,12,Clyde Frog,Oh grow up.
20,15,12,Eric Cartman,Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
21,15,12,Stan Marsh,"That's what we mean by ""grow up"" dude! Stop being a baby!"
22,15,12,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! [Cartman gasps]"
23,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl."
24,15,12,Clyde Frog,"But Eric, you are cool."
25,15,12,Eric Cartman,"I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault."
26,15,12,Peter Panda,"It's not your fault, Eric. How can they blame you for what is clearly President Obama's fault?"
27,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, Peter Panda?"
28,15,12,Peter Panda,You didn't make that stupid Presidential Fitness Test. Obama did.
29,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl."
30,15,12,Eric Cartman,Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
31,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon."
32,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver."
33,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? [the doors burst open and Cartman steps in and looks around. No one says a word]"
34,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! [slams a door, but it doesn't close. Cartman walks out]"
35,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club."
36,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit."
37,15,12,Fifth Grader,Yeah. The fifth graders agree. We're all being punished for one lazy bitch. Let's make him suffer.
38,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
39,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary."
40,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?"
41,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair."
42,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,What do you want me to do about it?
43,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate."
44,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"[rises from his chair and approaches a chart] 'Fraid that's impossible. The National Fitness Test has very specific standards. No one child can ever be made to feel singled out. We don't even like to use the term ""physically fit"" anymore because it can make a student feel unphysically fit, and then that student might end up feeling like a total retard."
45,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?"
46,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.
47,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is."
48,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
49,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Mom, have you been here all day?!"
50,15,12,Liane Cartman,"No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?"
51,15,12,Eric Cartman,Somebody's been in my room! [she looks up at him as he goes back to his room. He looks under his things to see if anything is missing. His mom appears at the door] Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
52,15,12,Liane Cartman,"Are you sure, sweetie?"
53,15,12,Eric Cartman,Am I sure?? Look at this place!
54,15,12,Liane Cartman,But who would want to s-
55,15,12,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and glares at her] Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me! [goes back to searching his stuff and finds a watch] They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch... [finds a video game] My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have- [looks at a corner of his room. A chair set apart for Clyde Frog is empty, but his other four dolls are arranged and seated in from of it.]  Oh my God. [panicking] Clyde Frog!"
56,15,12,Liane Cartman,What?
57,15,12,Eric Cartman,"No. [goes to the corner and tosses his dolls aside, then looks up in despair] NOOO! [runs to his closet and looks in there. He doesn't find Clyde Frog in there] CLYDE FROG!! [stops to tell him mom] They took Clyde Frog! [runs out of his room. Liane is confused]"
58,15,12,Eric Cartman,"[calling out and walking around] Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?! [stops and notices something on a tree. It is Clyde Frog, nailed to a tree through his front paws and forehead. It's ripped all over and cotton pops out of the rips. Under the frog is the word ""VENGEANCE"" scratched onto the tree bark in red spray paint] Clyde. CLYDE FROG! [throws up]"
59,15,12,Eric Cartman,"I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers. [Stan and Kyle are falling asleep. Kyle rests his head on his left hand] And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-"
60,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut the hell up, Cartman!"
61,15,12,Eric Cartman,Got something to say Kyle?! [grips the sides of the podium]
62,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
63,15,12,Eric Cartman,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle! [stops himself] Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. [a bagpipe player begins a tune. Two men lower the casket into the ground]"
64,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-"
65,15,12,Craig Tucker,Where's our five dollars?
66,15,12,Eric Cartman,Fly bu-what?
67,15,12,Craig Tucker,It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
68,15,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
69,15,12,Eric Cartman,[thinks a moment] Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
70,15,12,Class,AWWW! [all the kids get up and leave]
71,15,12,Kid 1,Come on!
72,15,12,Kid 2,Screw this.
73,15,12,Kid 4,"Hurry up, screw this."
74,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ."
75,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?"
76,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Oh yes, the Boom Boom Chubby Choom Choom school."
77,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them."
78,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"[runs to the front door followed by the receptionist] Oh my Jesus! Oh, not a 99% rally."
79,15,12,Butters Stotch,I sure hope this works.
80,15,12,Field Reporter 1,"[out of nowhere] Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this? [no comment from either of the boys]"
81,15,12,Eric Cartman,Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
82,15,12,Peter Panda,Why would somebody do such a terrible thing?
83,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl."
84,15,12,Eric Cartman,"I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!"
85,15,12,Rumpertumskin,"Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business."
86,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?"
87,15,12,Rumpertumskin,"We all know who fuckin' killed Clyde Frog, and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives!"
88,15,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?"
89,15,12,Polly Prissypants,Does everything look okay?
90,15,12,Peter Panda,"Sit down, you fucking bitch."
91,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party."
92,15,12,Liane Cartman,"[takes a seat at the other end of the table] Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-"
93,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Shut your fat piehole, bitch!"
94,15,12,Rumpertumskin,"Yeah! You know what you did, skank! You let Clyde Frog get murdered!"
95,15,12,Liane Cartman,"No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear."
96,15,12,Muscleman Marc,"Then why did you write in your diary ""It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals"" anyway?!"
97,15,12,Eric Cartman,"That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue."
98,15,12,Muscleman Marc,"Well, all I'm saying, Eric, is that-"
99,15,12,Liane Cartman,"Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-"
100,15,12,Muscleman Marc,"ALL I'M SAYING, ERIC, is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason!"
101,15,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it."
102,15,12,Eric Cartman,"So then, we are all going to need some... more tea."
103,15,12,Sgt Yates,"[on the phone calling for backup] You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks! [hangs up and walks to the command center nearby] Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?"
104,15,12,Officer 1,"It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area. [next to Red Robin]"
105,15,12,Sgt Yates,And where are the actual protesters?
106,15,12,Officer 1,"Oh, these two people right here. [circles the spot on which Butters and Jimmy stand]"
107,15,12,Sgt Yates,How are we gonna contain this ting?!
108,15,12,Officer 2,I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.
109,15,12,Sgt Yates,Bon Jovi?
110,15,12,Officer 2,"These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer."
111,15,12,Sgt Yates,Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards? [steps forward] Full-on class warfare.
112,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What the hell?! [the flames set his curtains on fire. He sees them next to his bed and stands up on the bed] Mom? Mom, my room is... [turns around and sees Peter Panda and his dresser on fire] AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!"
113,15,12,Fireman 1,The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.
114,15,12,Eric Cartman,[runs up] Don't you touch him! Leave him alone! [swats the doll out of the fireman's hands] Peter Panda!
115,15,12,Peter Panda,"Eh, Eric."
116,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!"
117,15,12,Peter Panda,Eric... Remember... [sobbing] Stay... keeewl. [Eric begins bawling. The fireman picks the doll back up]
118,15,12,Fireman 2,"Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence."
119,15,12,Eric Cartman,[on all fours] Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
120,15,12,Female Reporter,"The 99%ers movement continues to grow as more and more Americans occupy Red Robin. I asked some of the people exactly what they hoped to accomplish. [earlier] And sir, what do you hope to accomplish by this movement?"
121,15,12,Red Robin Patron,"I like the uh, A1 Peppercorn Burger. And they got ummm, bo-bottomless fries."
122,15,12,Female Reporter,"And as the protesters inside Red Robin unite together, word is that filmmaker Michael Moore has joined the protesters outside."
123,15,12,Michael Moore,[through his bull horn] I look at the faces of you protesters and I see the future of America! We are the 99%! YESSS!!
124,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?"
125,15,12,Fifth Grader,Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. You got any proof?
126,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?"
127,15,12,Fifth Grader,That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.
128,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire."
129,15,12,Fifth Grader,"He's in your class but you don't deal with him! So we are gonna remedy the situation! We've got big plans! Just stay out of our way and let the men handle this! [closes the door. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny turn around to leave.]"
130,15,12,Liane Cartman,Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
131,15,12,Bob Black,Of course. You can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage.
132,15,12,Linda Black,"To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close."
133,15,12,Liane Cartman,"I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token."
134,15,12,Eric Cartman,"This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright."
135,15,12,Token Black,Why are you involving me in this?
136,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong."
137,15,12,Field Reporter 2,"Breaking news from the Occupy Red Robin movement. The protesters have decreased in number from two to one, as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement: Occupy the Restroom."
138,15,12,Field Reporter 1,"Tom, Occupy the Restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now. Certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever. These 99%ers are fed up, [backs up to the restroom door] and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is ""OCCUPIED."" [points to a little window that now reads ""OCCUPIED."" A second later, a toilet is flushed inside. The door opens and Butters exits zipping his pants up.] Uh, Tom, it looks like the movement is finished, but from the time it took, it must have been a pretty decent-sized movement."
139,15,12,Token Black,[getting irritated] Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
140,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?"
141,15,12,Token Black,This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
142,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home."
143,15,12,Token Black,You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
144,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me. [the alarm sounds. Cartman puts his chips aside and gathers his toys close] What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!"
145,15,12,Token Black,That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
146,15,12,Eric Cartman,What?! Who?!
147,15,12,Token Black,I don't know.
148,15,12,Eric Cartman,"I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! [Token looks out his window, Cartman leaves the bedroom]"
149,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Who's there?! [notices Token coming out behind him] Lock that door behind you, Token. [then shouts at whomever might be there] Black people live here! [some flood lights come on]"
150,15,12,Token Black,A motion detector. [Kyle's shadow runs by and Cartman notices it. He gives chase and tackles Kyle]
151,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!"
152,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!"
153,15,12,Eric Cartman,Oh sure!
154,15,12,Stan Marsh,"[walking out from behind a garage] Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned."
155,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader? [looks around] Oh shit! [drops the bat and runs back inside] I told you to lock that door, Token! [runs up to Token's room and searches for his stuffed toys] No. [sees the other four boys come in] Nononono! [grabs Kenny by the throat and shakes him] Where are they Kenny??!!"
156,15,12,Kenny McCormick,[slaps Cartman's hand off] (I don't really know!)
157,15,12,Eric Cartman,"HAAAAGH! [runs out and closes the door, then locks it and runs off]"
158,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
159,15,12,Eric Cartman,[returns] I don't trust any of you assholes! [to his dolls] Where are you sons of bitches?! [leaves]
160,15,12,Stephen Tamil and two other Fifth Graders,Alright guys. You ready?
161,15,12,Classmates,Ready!
162,15,12,Stephen Tamil and two other Fifth Graders,"Here we GO! [he and one of his friends raise their signs, and the three of them march forth]"
163,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?"
164,15,12,Stephen Tamil and two other Fifth Graders,We are the 83%! We are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class! The fourth grade is stickin' it to the other 83% of the school!
165,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%."
166,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?"
167,15,12,Stephen Tamil and two other Fifth Graders,"Because your class had Cartman in it, and he's the 1%!"
168,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%."
169,15,12,Field Reporter 3,This is it. The inevitable has happened at Occupy Red Robin. It is full-on class warfare.
170,15,12,Female Reporter 2,And now class warfare is breaking out. Apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class.
171,15,12,Sgt Yates,It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
172,15,12,Officer 2,Yeeah!
173,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Hello?? [lightning crackles outside and floods the kitchen in light for a moment] Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! [sees a boiling crock pot, walks up to it and removes the lid. Inside he see the third...]"
174,15,12,Eric Cartman,Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! [more lightning crackles as he runs out of the kitchen.]
175,15,12,Eric Cartman,Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin! [walks towards the fireplace] Jesus Christ! [over the fireplace he sees Rumpertumskin drawn up by four chains and a bomb wrapped around his neck]
176,15,12,Rumpertumskin,Eric! Don't come any closer!
177,15,12,Eric Cartman,Who did this to you?!
178,15,12,Rumpertumskin,You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
179,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, I'll get you down!"
180,15,12,Rumpertumskin,"No Eric, don't come any- [Cartman trips a wire that sets off the bomb, decapitating Rumpertumskin]"
181,15,12,Eric Cartman,AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER [begins to cry] Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
182,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"It's okay, Eric. It's over now. [you can see Cartman actually doing her voice. He expresses shock, then turns around. Polly Prissypants is seated on an armchair with a loaded gun resting against her]"
183,15,12,Eric Cartman,Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
184,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up."
185,15,12,Eric Cartman,"...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! [Token, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny look down from the second floor]"
186,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together."
187,15,12,Eric Cartman,They were your FRIENDS!
188,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!"
189,15,12,Bob Black,"Dead-bolted. Token! [knocks twice, then heads for the window] Token, you in there?! [the three adults look in]"
190,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!"
191,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after."
192,15,12,Eric Cartman,"There's one problem. [walks up to the doll, takes the gun and walks back to where he was] You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything."
193,15,12,Polly Prissypants,Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
194,15,12,Eric Cartman,Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
195,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric."
196,15,12,Eric Cartman,"[sobs for almost a minute, then aims the gun] Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you."
197,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Say ""hello"" to the sunrise for me. [Cartman cries and looks away as he starts firing at her. First shot is straight through the forehead. He fires twice more as the four boys watch from the second floor, and three more as the Blacks and Ms. Cartman watch from outside. Polly Prissypants has four shots through the head and two more that took out chunks of her cheeks. Cartman cries, having lost the last of his stuffed dolls]"
198,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell?"
199,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
200,15,12,Liane Cartman,[apologetic] My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. [laughs weakly]
201,15,12,Field Reporter 3,"Occupy Red Robin is over. Class warfare has torn apart the 99% and replaced it with the 30%, the 26%, and even little brackets of 5%s here and there. What does this mean for our country? What oes this mean... for me?"
202,15,12,Officer 2,Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!
203,15,12,Field Reporter 3,Oh hell yeah! I'll occupy me some goat-cheese peppadew peppers! [runs off]
