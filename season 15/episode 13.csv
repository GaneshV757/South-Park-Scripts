0,15,13,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats. [most of them are seated; Kyle, Token, Bebe and Stan are the last four to get seated] As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American."
1,15,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh neato, huh fellas?"
2,15,13,Guest,"[a stout ""Native American""] Hello boys and girls. My name is David Running Horse... Sawitsky, and I am one sixteenth Cherokee Indian."
3,15,13,Eric Cartman,Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? [Sawitsky crosses his arms and is not all all pleased]
4,15,13,Sawitsky,"There've been a lot of ""stories"" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?"
5,15,13,Butters Stotch,[innocently] Thanksgiving is about murder?
6,15,13,Eric Cartman,This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
7,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over."
8,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them."
9,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks over his shoulder angrily] Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!"
10,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today."
11,15,13,Stan Marsh,"We all have to do this report together, dude."
12,15,13,Eric Cartman,"You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV."
13,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,How is that gonna help?!
14,15,13,Eric Cartman,"[like a doorbell] Dumbass, it's November. [normally] The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need."
15,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"You're watching The History Channel, where the truth is history."
16,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,[as re-enactments play in color and in black and white] A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
17,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?"
18,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"[more re-enactments] We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens! [dramatic flashes of darkness as the alien is shown up close, then a picture of a fetus, and then...]"
19,15,13,Duncan Everton,"[Professor of History, Oakmont H.S.] In every journal entry we researched from those early Pilgrims, not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there."
20,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"And what about the food? [a juicy baked turkey is shown, then the previous image is shown without the alien] Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? [the alien reappears in the scene, but with two other aliens]"
21,15,13,Eric Cartman,Uh-huh??
22,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,What? This isn't history.
23,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it is called History Channel."
24,15,13,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
25,15,13,Charles Biggens,"[Culinary Associates of America] And if we look in all the journals and aall the history books, there is no reference to stuffing before 1621. So where did it come from? Did it come from space? We just don't know."
26,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form? [an alien with an erect penis is drawn over the aerial image] What exactly did the Pilgrims experience? [colored lights move around over the ocean's horizon as Pilgrims gather by the beach] How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? [a tiny UFO hovers near a turkey]"
27,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,What??
28,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?"
29,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
30,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? [he and Kenny raise their hands, then Stan raises his]"
31,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,[at Stan] Dude!
32,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? [raises Kyle's hand]"
33,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[sighs] Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!"
34,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",[sits up in bed] Yes? A report from where? [sits up on the side of the bed] Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can. [hangs up and sits back down]
35,15,13,Wife,Darling?
36,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",They found something. This could be it. [makes a fist]
37,15,13,Eric Cartman,Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
38,15,13,Stan Marsh,...What?
39,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause."
40,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!"
41,15,13,Eric Cartman,"See what I mean, you guys? [a black car with tinted windows pulls up at a corner within sight of the boys and the passenger window comes down and the agents inside look at the boys]"
42,15,13,Agent 1,[brunet] Is that them?
43,15,13,Agent 2,[blond] That's them.
44,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",You boys have been very busy... [he closes the report] We need to know everything that you know.
45,15,13,Stan Marsh,'bout what?
46,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
47,15,13,Agent 1,Did you come across some kind of ship or something?
48,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel."
49,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","[silence for a few seconds, then] We are The History Channel. [rises from his chair] For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence."
50,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,We saw it on your channel.
51,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",What exactly did you seez?!
52,15,13,Stan Marsh,"That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?"
53,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
54,15,13,Steven Stotch,"Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel."
55,15,13,Butters Stotch,Okay Dad.
56,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"You're watching the History Channel, the only network dedicated to history. Coming up next, it's Monster Quest! Larrh! Followed by Hairy Bikers. Errh! But now, back to Part 3 of Ancient Aliens at Thanksgiving."
57,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings."
58,15,13,Stan Marsh,[history expert] Stuffing wasn't mentioned anywhere until 1621? And it might have been... alien technology?
59,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?"
60,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[Ph. D., Professor of Thanksgiving - DeVry Institute] Of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can't ""prove"" that... the Pilgrims themselves weren't alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand! Maybe that symbol matches... galaxies in space or something! OooOoOoOooOOO! [moves his hands around]"
61,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"[a scene of alien families sharing Thanksgiving on Earth] Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say ""yes."""
62,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
63,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. [smiles]"
64,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. [a knock is heard at the front door and Kyle goes to answer it]
65,15,13,Sawitsky,What are you doing?!
66,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,...Uh oh.
67,15,13,Sawitsky,The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
68,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
69,15,13,Sawitsky,Haven't my people been through enough?! [whips out a gun with his left hand and quickly aims at at Kyle] Goddamn you!
70,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,Ack dude! [backs up as Sawitzky walks towards him]
71,15,13,Sawitsky,"The white man is gonna PAY for his lies! [stops in front of Stan and Kenny, keeping his gun aimed at Kyle]"
72,15,13,Agent 2,"Look at this, sir! [hands him a picture] An aerial photograph of Cape Cod where the Pilgrims landed in 1620. [puts his right hand on it and traces a turkey on the photo with it] Five Pilgrim settlements, with Plymouth Rock here. [puts a dot on the location] The same symbols appear everywhere in history. [on a baked turkey, in the night sky...]"
73,15,13,Agent 1,"The symbology lines up to mirrored points in space. If Kyle Broflovski is right, then Plymouth Rock is some kind of wormhole."
74,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
75,15,13,Agent 3,Sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things.
76,15,13,Agent 2,True dat.
77,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",True dat.
78,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
79,15,13,Agent 4,"[through his bullhorn] Alight people, let's clear out! We need you ALL to disperse! [a woman and her daughter stop to listen] This area is under quarantine. [the woman and daughter leave]"
80,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Give me a piece of chalk. [agent 1 hands it to him. The president quickly traces a turkey on the rock, then backs up.] Huh... Nothing."
81,15,13,Agent 5,Guess Kyle Broflovski was wrong.
82,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid. [they all turn and walk out of the water] We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space."
83,15,13,Agent 6,Here. You can see it right there. An object clearly fell from the sky and struck the Earth.
84,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",What is it?
85,15,13,Agent 6,"It's a Pilgrim, sir. [the president is stunned, looks outside, then walks outside with five other men]"
86,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all. [the camera pans up into the sky. Another camera travels through space]"
87,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets. [the camera approaches a rock formation that has golden (literally) ears of corn sticking out of it. The camera then goes around the formation and through a thick cloud layer] These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth. [the camera pops up and sees a magnificent building from which rise four massive golden ears of corn. An entrance with 14 colossal Pilgrim statues is shown. Inside the cathedral-like building a Pilgrim king, seated on a throne flanked by two huge golden cornucopias overflowing with gold and jewels, speaks to a huge crowd]"
88,15,13,Pilgrim King,Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!
89,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples","Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING! [the Indians cheer]"
90,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?"
91,15,13,Liane Cartman,What hon?
92,15,13,Eric Cartman,Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
93,15,13,Liane Cartman,"Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet."
94,15,13,Eric Cartman,Oh no. Oh NO!
95,15,13,Liane Cartman,"What is it, hon?"
96,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! [turns around and leaves the kitchen]"
97,15,13,Eric Cartman,You guys have stuffing?!
98,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.
99,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come! [Liane takes a shopping cart and follows Cartman to the right aisle. Cartman looks for the stuffing, but doesn't fine any. The attendant walks by] Hey! Where is it!"
100,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,"It's right there, right on the uh... [sees that the stuffing shelf is empty] wait, that can't be right. Hey, hey Chet. What happened to all the stuffing?"
101,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,"[walks up] What are you talking about? [sees that there is no stuffing, and his jaw drops a bit]"
102,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,"We got more in the back, right?"
103,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,"I just did inventory in the back, it... it was all put out here!"
104,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,You mean it's two weeks until Thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing?!
105,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,Oh no!
106,15,13,Eric Cartman,No!
107,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,No!
108,15,13,Eric Cartman,NO!
109,15,13,Pilgrim King,"You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!"
110,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",The stuffing mines were never yours!
111,15,13,Pilgrim King,"Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!"
112,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!
113,15,13,Pilgrim King,And how knoweth you that?!
114,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",Word travels fast in our sector.
115,15,13,Pilgrim King,"I do not give free bowls of stuffing, what sayest you?! We will take back control of the stuffing mines! [turns and leaves with his men]"
116,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",Then the Thanksgiving treaty will be off! [turns and leaves with his men]
117,15,13,Pilgrim King,"And I pray to stuffing that you are wrong. [looks up to the sky as his men move on without him] Where are you, Miles Standish?"
118,15,13,"David ""Running Horse"" Sawitzky","And furthermore, everything Kyle Broflovski said about Native Americans being from outer space was untrue! Native Americans were brutalized, and David Sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology! It was wrong to mix aliens and real history!"
119,15,13,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?"
120,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[through gritted teeth] Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!"
121,15,13,Stan Marsh,I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
122,15,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, that's true.)"
123,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,Would you guys stop!
124,15,13,Sawitsky,Just keep writing your apology! [paces. The front door opens and Miles Standish jumps in dramatically]
125,15,13,Miles Standish,"How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?!"
126,15,13,Sawitsky,[surprised] Huh? [Miles runs at him and throws him up against a wall] Ack.
127,15,13,Stan Marsh,Dude!
128,15,13,Miles Standish,"You Indians took me to thy planet, and then cast me here! Why?! [punches Sawitzky twice. Sawitzky falls to the floor and Miles begins kicking him in the balls]"
129,15,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Go, dude!)"
130,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, go on dude!"
131,15,13,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
132,15,13,Miles Standish,"[turns Sawitzky over and picks him up] Hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die?! Tell me, Indian!"
133,15,13,"David ""Running Horse"" Sawitzky",I I uh I'm only one sixteenth.
134,15,13,Miles Standish,"Hold your lying tongue! [puts a glowing ball into Sawitzky's mouth] This shall prove if thou art Indian or not! [Sawitzky begins to tremble and moan, then he's surrounded by a purple light and consumed] Ah, he was not."
135,15,13,Stan Marsh,I didn't think so.
136,15,13,Miles Standish,"[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] I have been told of your expertise, Kyle of DeVry Institute. I need your wisdom to get back to my planet."
137,15,13,Miles Standish,Into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me! [the boys get in] We must make haste to Cape Cod! [then he does]
138,15,13,Stan Marsh,[looking at the driver] Who's this?
139,15,13,Miles Standish,This is Natalie.
140,15,13,Natalie Portman,Hi guys.
141,15,13,Agent 7,"Alright, sir. We got some more information on the Pilgrim who crashed to Earth. Thirty seconds after impact the Pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat."
142,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Who did the truck belong to?
143,15,13,Agent 6,"We believe it belonged to Natalie Portman, sir."
144,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",The actress? That doesn't make sense.
145,15,13,Agent 8,It gets worse. All over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing. We don't think it's coincidence.
146,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this ""Pilgrim"" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!"
147,15,13,Agent 9,"Look, if anyone knows about stuffing, it's Natalie Portman!"
148,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","[walking forward, filling the screen] We have to find Professor Broflovski. He was right about all of this. He'll know what to do."
149,15,13,Miles Standish,We shall make camp here for the night. On the morrow perhaps we can reach Cape Cod. And Thanksgiving may yet be saved. [looks outside and sees Kyle] What is wrong with Kyle of DeVry Institute?
150,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing."
151,15,13,Miles Standish,"[studying Kyle some more] He seems almost like a Puritan lady whose period hath stopped. [moments later, he goes outside to talk to Kyle] I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on."
152,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, ah I don't."
153,15,13,Miles Standish,"It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world."
154,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,I actually only just said that sarcastically.
155,15,13,Miles Standish,"HA1 Ha ha ha ha ha ha! [pats him on the left shoulder a few times] Then you are only just a remarkably gifted child! [puts his right hand over Kyle's left hand, then withdraws it to pull out a map] Here, let me show you. Your planet is one of the five. [points to the others] Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim, and this planet over here nobody really cares about. [spreads his right hand over the map so each fingertip touches a planet, then traces the hand with a pencil] The five are connected by a series of wormholes. [the trace is finished] My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over."
156,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them."
157,15,13,Miles Standish,"You can't believe what everyone tells you, Kyle. You have to open your eyes. [stands up and puts down his map on his seat. Natalie, Stan, and Kenny look on from the trailer] Soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to Plymouth, and the stuffing mines can again be ours, for he who controls the stuffing, controls the universe. [all of a sudden, a night sun focuses on him and a helicopter is heard]"
158,15,13,A pilot,"Hold it right there! [five black cars pull up quickly and surround Miles and Kyle. Natalie, Stan and Kyle leave the trailer]"
159,15,13,Agent 1,We found Professor Broflovski! He is with the Pilgrim! [the agents close in on Miles and he unsheathes his sword]
160,15,13,Miles Standish,"Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death!"
161,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","[rushes into the middle] Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open."
162,15,13,Miles Standish,"I trust none but them! [points to the party he came with - Natalie, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] Indians hath betrayed us! I must return to Plymouth so my king can know the truth! [hurries away]"
163,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",PLEASE! [stops him] We're the History Channel. We care as much about the truth as you do.
164,15,13,Miles Standish,Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible!
165,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples","[shot through with several arrows] My Lord! My Lord, the battle is lost! We have tried to stop the Indians on their home planet, but yea they are too strong!"
166,15,13,Pilgrim King,Then our last chance for survival is gone?
167,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",I'm sorry my Lord. All Pilgrim forces sent to the Indians' planet have been wiped out.
168,15,13,Pilgrim King,And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!
169,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",The stuffing mines are ours! [some Indians celebrate at the mines]
170,15,13,Miles Standish,"Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving."
171,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work."
172,15,13,Miles Standish,"Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal."
173,15,13,Agent 11,The keeper of the... of course! Natalie Portman!
174,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
175,15,13,Agent 12,"Our window of opportunity is closing, sir! The wormhole has to be opened now!"
176,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole."
177,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. No."
178,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!"
179,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmm. [then to the right] Uh uh."
180,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
181,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. No."
182,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?! [everyone moves aside to reveal Kyle] What do we do, Professor Broflovski?"
183,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not a professor.
184,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",The History Channel said you were!
185,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,You are the fucking History Channel!
186,15,13,Miles Standish,"[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] Please, Kyle of DeVry Institute. There is no more time for squabbles. The universe is at stake!"
187,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here. [points to Kyle's heart.] You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
188,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?"
189,15,13,Natalie Portman,"I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child."
190,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[having trouble with small talk] Wow, awesome. Um..."
191,15,13,Natalie Portman,"I have dual citizenship in the United States and Israel. [a waiter with a bottle of wine walks by and Kyle snaps his fingers twice, then indicates to the waiter that Natalie should get some more wine. The waiter serves it] Oh thanks."
192,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Um... so... [behind him, everyone involved in the portal matter is watching them] So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that."
193,15,13,Natalie Portman,"Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too."
194,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
195,15,13,Natalie Portman,"Thanks, that was a lot of fun."
196,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it was cool, thanks. [looks over his shoulder. Miles motions at him to continue] Um, so... Is there any way you'd"
197,15,13,Natalie Portman,What?
198,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You know, could youuu..."
199,15,13,Natalie Portman,What?
200,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,Would you please just open your wormhole?!
201,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Oh. [moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Mmmm... [moves her torso to the right] no."
202,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,[sighs in exasperation] Errh!
203,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. Okay."
204,15,13,Miles Standish,Yes!
205,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Alright, let's go, folks! [he and several other men go towards Plymouth Rock]"
206,15,13,Natalie Portman,Just for a sec though. [turns around and joins them]
207,15,13,Miles Standish,"Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!"
208,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. [behind the rock, Natalie's legs go up in the air]"
209,15,13,Stan Marsh,"It's cool dude, we understand."
210,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,I guess we should all realize... [the portal is activated] that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. [the portal shoots out into space towards planet Plymouth]
211,15,13,Miles Standish,"[rises with his sword unsheathed] Now make way, children! For I have a war to fight! [runs towards the rock, jumps on it, and into the portal stream] For stuffing!! [goes towards planet Plymouth]"
212,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",Take ALL their stuffing!
213,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples","The treaty ends now! [the Indians retreat as flying galleons sweep over the stuffing mines with powerful rays, destroying any Indians along the way]"
214,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army."
215,15,13,Miles Standish,Now attack their left flank! Good! They're retreating! Hit them with the anti-Indian device! [A destroyer walks in and obliterates all the Indians with its powerful beams]
216,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables."
217,15,13,Random Voices,Yea. Stuffing mines. Yea.
218,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.
219,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before."
220,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, History Channel rules."
221,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been... [an image of a woman appears against a wall] haunted!
222,15,13,Donald T Brown,"[Ph. D., University of Phoenix] There is certainly no evidence that the first Thanksgiving dinner was not haunted."
223,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? [ghostly figures appear here and there.]"
224,15,13,Eric Cartman,Uhhh??
225,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[throws up his arms in exasperation] Oh, come on!!"
