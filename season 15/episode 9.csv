0,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready. [spits something out, wipes his lips clean with the back of his shirt sleeve, and returns to patrolling the border] There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!"
1,15,9,Liane Cartman,"[walking out] Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?"
2,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah! [turns to the boys on the ground - Clyde, Craig, and Timmy] All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!"
3,15,9,The other four,Yeehaw! [Timmy stays silent]
4,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!"
5,15,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader."
6,15,9,Butters Stotch,"[saddened] Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?"
7,15,9,Stan Marsh,"You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco."
8,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them."
9,15,9,Eric Cartman,[robot voice] Scanning for Mexicans. [more sound effects] Oh! [He spots Kyle coming out of the woods] We've got a Mexican! [Clyde and Craig take up posts]
10,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
11,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[to the other boys] He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid. [to Kyle] Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!"
12,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,Better than being a fat-ass Texan!
13,15,9,Eric Cartman,Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
14,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!"
15,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew! [Stan sneaks in past a cardboard box labelled ""Christmas Ornaments""] Let's just see you try and-!"
16,15,9,Stan Marsh,Base! [the others turn to see Stan in their midst]
17,15,9,Eric Cartman,Clyde?! [descends from his perch atop the border and goes to Clyde] The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
18,15,9,Clyde Donovan,I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
19,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit! [Token appears at the other end of the border and hops over] If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!"
20,15,9,Token Black,Base!
21,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude!! [walks over to Craig] How did he get past the fence, Craig?!"
22,15,9,Craig Tucker,I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
23,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! [Jimmy walks by in the foreground]"
24,15,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Eh, b-base."
25,15,9,Eric Cartman,Oh God! [throws down his hat]
26,15,9,Stan Marsh,"So, so then, so then the pope says, ""Maybe you should go check the toilet."" [most of the other boys laugh]"
27,15,9,Craig Tucker,"Hey. Hey, I got one. [the other get quiet] Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?"
28,15,9,Token Black,Why?
29,15,9,Craig Tucker,'Cause they're ugly and they stink. [most of the other boys laugh]
30,15,9,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game."
31,15,9,Eric Cartman,I'm not pouting! I've just heard all these jokes before!
32,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
33,15,9,Eric Cartman,"At least I have an asshole, Kyle! [the boys laugh]"
34,15,9,Butters Stotch,"[thinking to himself] Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: ""Go that way."" How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans."
35,15,9,Butters Stotch,"[wanders around] Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border! [walks further away, and finds a road. He walks along the shoulder and shivers as he sings] Lalala, lalala, Work Meheecan Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Meheecan Work. [A couple in a car drive up behind him]"
36,15,9,Woman,"Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse."
37,15,9,Elderly Man,It sure is. I-I can barely see. [Butters turns around and the woman suddenly sees him]
38,15,9,Woman,"Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! [the man loses control and hits Butters, who simply tumbles off the car and onto the shoulder, face down. The couple stops the car and goes to check on Butters. The wife turns him over]"
39,15,9,Elderly Man,"Oh my God, are you alright?"
40,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. M-mis amigos, my a-, my amigos are waiting."
41,15,9,Elderly Man,Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.
42,15,9,Butters Stotch,"I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans."
43,15,9,Woman,"[showing him around the room] Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay. [kneels before him] Do you understand?"
44,15,9,Elderly Man,"Darling, I don't know if we can keep him."
45,15,9,Woman,What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?! [to Butters] Win-dow. Wiinnn-dow.
46,15,9,Elderly Man,"Yep, window."
47,15,9,Woman,"[pleased] Bueno! [to her husband] He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico! [to Butters] Window. Windooow. [gives him a bottle of] Win-dex. Wiiin-dex, Mantequilla. Paper towel. [squirts some Windex onto the towel and takes Butters to the window] Sí, sí Mantequilla [shows Butters how to clean the window, then leaves him to continue doing it himself]"
48,15,9,Elderly Man,"Auhp, be sure to get the edges."
49,15,9,Woman,"Oh darling, it's wonderful."
50,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[talking in his sleep] No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got... [wakes up] Butters! [gets up, then tries to get the others up] Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!"
51,15,9,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about?
52,15,9,Eric Cartman,Where is Butters?
53,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,[after a few seconds] He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
54,15,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I think he was? Wait."
55,15,9,Craig Tucker,Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
56,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,Butters?
57,15,9,Stan Marsh,Butters!
58,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[hugs himself] Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead."
59,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[puts on his ranger hat, now speaking in his Texan voice] All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through! [walks towards the woods, but stops long enough to tell Kyle] You haven't won yet! [smiles evilly and moves on] Game on!"
60,15,9,Craig Tucker,Game on!
61,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Wugh, game on. [puts on his mustache]"
62,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Work, Mexican, Work. [hums some more] Work, Mexican, Work"
63,15,9,Woman,"[arrives at the kitchen entrance] Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. [leaves. Butters follows her out]"
64,15,9,Elderly Man,Surprise! We've scraped some money together and got you something. [Butters grins]
65,15,9,Woman,"It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente."
66,15,9,Butters Stotch,Wow! A present just for me? [starts to unwrap it]
67,15,9,Woman,Oh he's such a happy little Mexican. [Butters finishes unwrapping it only to see a gas-powered leaf blower designed to be worn on the back]
68,15,9,Elderly Man,"How do you like that, Mantequilla? Your very own leaf blower! Hahah, I have no idea how it works, but I'm sure you do, huh. Say, how'd you like to go in the back yard and play? [moments later, Butters is in the back yard using the power blower to blow some leaves around. The couple watch him from a table with umbrella providing shade]"
69,15,9,Woman,"Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy."
70,15,9,Elderly Man,"Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you."
71,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Ah, sí señor."
72,15,9,Woman,Oh he's so adorable.
73,15,9,Backup Singers,"Work, Mexican, work."
74,15,9,Butters Stotch,"All week long, bossman say"

83,15,9,Butters Stotch,While people play in the sun all day
84,15,9,Both,"Work, Mexican, work."
85,15,9,Elderly Man,"Honey? Honey, what's wrong? [she looks up to see him]"
86,15,9,Woman,"It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the windows, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said ""I need to go home."" I tried telling him ""your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!"" But I don't think he feels it."
87,15,9,Elderly Man,"Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-"
88,15,9,Woman,"No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!"
89,15,9,Brian Whipple,"Come on, honey. [they walk back to the car]"
90,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey, where are you going?"
91,15,9,Woman,[turns around] No! Mantequilla bad! Go now!
92,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?"
93,15,9,Woman,"No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! [they reach the car, get in, and drive off. The woman is still weeping]"
94,15,9,Butters Stotch,"So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! [the workers all stop in shock and look at him, a utensil can be heard hitting the floor]"
95,15,9,Worker 1,Mantequilla?
96,15,9,Worker 2,Mantequilla?
97,15,9,Worker 1,"¡Yo he escuchado de este niño! ¡He visto anuncios de el por donde quiera! [""I've HEARD of this kids! I've seen POSTERS and BILLBOARDS of him everywhere!""]"
98,15,9,Worker 3,"Sí. Es famoso! [""Yeah. He's FAMOUS!""]"
99,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!"
100,15,9,Worker 1,"¿Un niño gringo que quiere ses mexicano? [""A WHITE American kid who wants to be Mexican?""]"
101,15,9,Worker 3,"Ay, tiempos han cambiado. [""Wow, times are really changing""]"
102,15,9,Worker 1,"No... no. ¿Saben qué? Mantequilla tiene derecho. ¿Por qué venimos a este país? ¡Vale madre aquí, 'mano! [""No... no, you know what? Mantequilla is RIGHT! Why did we even come to this country? It SUCKS HERE, MAN!""]"
103,15,9,Butters Stotch,Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
104,15,9,Worker 1,"Debemos escuchar a este niño. ¡Mexico es mucho mejor que esto! [""We should listen to this kid. Mexico is better than this!""]"
105,15,9,Butters Stotch,"All my amigos are there, waitin' for me."
106,15,9,Worker 1,"Todos mis amigos están allí también.. [""All my amigos are back there too.""]"
107,15,9,Worker 2,"¡A la chingada con esto! ¡Vamonos! [""Come on, screw this! Let's go!""]"
108,15,9,Worker 3,"Sí, ¡vamonos a la chingada!"
109,15,9,Butters Stotch,Viva la Meheeco!
110,15,9,Doctor,"Alright, let's get him into ER."
111,15,9,Elderly Man,Careful w'my foot! [a car stops and a man whistles]
112,15,9,Worker 2,"¡Oye Yimenez! ¡Nos vamos a regresar, hombre! [""Hey Yimenez!!! We're going back, man!""]"
113,15,9,Nurse Yimenez,"¿Qué? [""What?""]"
114,15,9,Worker 2,"¡Este lugar es una mierda! ¡Nos regresamos a Mexico![""This place sucks! We're going back to Mexico!""]"
115,15,9,Butters Stotch,We're crossin' the border!
116,15,9,Nurse Yimenez,"¡Jose! ¡Martinez! Nos vamos para atras para Mexico! [""We're going back to Mexico!"" The nurses and other Hispanic workers pour out of the hospital]"
117,15,9,Butters Stotch,Olé!
118,15,9,Border Officer 1,Pretty quiet out there.
119,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Yeah, a bit too quiet if you ask me. Gimme those! [takes the binoculars and looks through them]"
120,15,9,Border Officer 1,"Just seems like Mexicans don't try to cross into the US as much as they used to, you know?"
121,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Noo, they're out there, Charlie. Plottin' their next move. They'll do anything they can to get into the Land of Opportunity. [lowers the binoculars. The first illegals appear on the US side of the border and head towards the fence] And as long as this country offers everyone a better life, there's gonna be people clamorin' to get it. It's the curse of success, Charlie. [more aliens appear as the first ones hop over the fence] A great and wealthy nation will always be plagued [raises the binoculars and looks through them again] by the needy tryin' to-what the hell? [sees the Mexicans running into Mexico. The other guard notices too]"
122,15,9,Officer Charlie,"[scratches his head] Uhh, sir? Aren't them Mexicans runnin' into Mexico?"
123,15,9,Border Officer 2,[lowers his binoculars] That don't make sense.
124,15,9,Officer Charlie,[shouting to the returning illegals] You're going the wrong way!
125,15,9,Anchorman Chris,"You've heard of Mexican salsa, but Mexican pride? The phenomenon is called ""Orgullo de Mantequilla,"" where Mexicans are realizing it actually is starting to suck more here in the US. The borders are being flooded with Latin Americans trying to get back to their own countries. [Randy and Sharon are on the sofa watching the news]"
126,15,9,Randy Marsh,"Well, I think it's good. [stands up and puts on his blazer, then walks to the front door] If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy. [opens the door and looks outside. Huge piles of leaves have been left on his front yard] NOOOOOO! [Audio clip is Darth Vader's voice from Star Wars Ep. III]"
127,15,9,Anchorman Chris,"But just what has sparked the Mexican desire to live... in Mexico? Joining us now is economist Mark Geiger, and Mark, we've heard of Mexican ice cream, but Mexican patriotism?"
128,15,9,Mr Geiger,"Yes, it's a very odd phenomenon, Chris. Ih it just- [the front door opens and it's Stan and Kyle, who are pretty miffed for obvious reasons]"
129,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell is this?! [he's holding a poster Cartman designed: ""Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol. Permission to shoot on sight.""]"
130,15,9,Eric Cartman,"You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up."
131,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"""Wanted by the U.S. Border Patrol""?! ""Permission to shoot on sight""?!"
132,15,9,Eric Cartman,"You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too."
133,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
134,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?[The news come back on, with Cartman glancing at his TV, with Kyle also staring, as Stan continues glaring at Cartman]"
135,15,9,Anchorman Chris,Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
136,15,9,Eric Cartman,Oh dude. Sweet.
137,15,9,Crowd,¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap] ¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap] ¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap]
138,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh uh, I'm sorry, [opens his arms wide] I don't really-"
139,15,9,Crowd,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [he lowers his arms and the crowd quiets down. He raises them up and] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [he raises his right arm] ¡Oy! [he lowers his arm and raises it a little] ¡Oy! [now raises his left arm] ¡Orgullo! [opens his arms wide] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [the crowd members raise their arms and some begin to toss their hats in the air]
140,15,9,Butters Stotch,Wow.
141,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Welcome to the US Border Patrol. You volunteers are the key to keepin' this country safe and prosperous. [begins to walk back and forth] Every day, more and more Mexicans are tryin' to get past this fence and go back to their homes in Mexico. As border patrol officers our duty is to stop Mexicans from crossin' the border. We don't need to worry about the semantics of which direction they're going, we're just supposed to stop them! [pounds his left fist into his right hand] Marcus?"
142,15,9,"Border Patrol Officers
Officer Charlie
Officer Marcus",The standard-issue border patrol weapon is the P-29 stun baton. [begins handing a baton to each volunteer] It carries a 4000 watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law.
143,15,9,Eric Cartman,This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
144,15,9,"Border Patrol Officers
Officer Charlie
Officer Marcus","The baton is non-lethal, but powerful e-"
145,15,9,Border Officer 3,Hey! We got some! Mexicans at 2 o'clock! [hands his binoculars over to Officer 2]
146,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Let's get ready, recruits! Must be a couple dozen of them! [Cartman takes out his own binoculars and begins scanning and providing his own sound effects] This is the US Border Patrol! Stop where you are! Turn around and get back to work!"
147,15,9,"Border Patrol Officers
Officer Charlie
Officer Marcus","There's too many of 'em! We're gonna need backup! [Cartman goes to a nearby water truck and opens a spigot, which releases water and creates a large puddle. The Mexicans run into the puddle and stand there. Cartman tosses his baton into the puddle, electrocuting the Mexicans.]"
148,15,9,Border Officer 2,"You're pretty good at stoppin' Mexicans, son. What's your name?"
149,15,9,Eric Cartman,Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
150,15,9,Narrator,"Dedicated. Patriotic. Tireless. These are the men and women of the US Border Patrol. They work around the clock protecting America's prosperity. They are the front line in making sure Mexicans stay here and work. The border patrol is uncompromising, diligent, and kewl. They will defend, arrest, and most importantly, let the Mexicans know that they are way better off here in the United States."
151,15,9,President Calder n,"¡Hoy celebramos el primer día de Mantequilla, honrando el espiritu de México! [""Today we celebrate the FIRST day of Mantequilla, honoring the spirit of Mexico!"" Everyone claps for Butters]"
152,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Thanks everyone. [hops onto the table] It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos. [gets sad] It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick."
153,15,9,President Calder n,"Mantequilla, tu tienes que hacer una decisión. Los Estados Unidos están de baja, y claro, México pronto será el mejor lugar. Pero como Mexicanos, nosotros sabemos que nada es más importante que la famlia, y amistades. Estás invitado a vivir con nosotros, Mantequilla, pero tienes que seguir tu corazón. ¿Quieres quedarte aquí con nosotros, o quieres estar con tus amigos? [""Mantequilla, you have a decision to make. The United States is on the decline, and clearly, Mexico will quickly become the better place to be. But as we Mexicans know, nothing is more important than FAMILY and FRIENDS. You are welcome to live with us, Mantequilla, but you must follow your heart. Do you want to stay here with us, or do you want to go back to your amigos?""]"
154,15,9,Butters Stotch,[aside to the Mexican sitting at the table with him] ...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
155,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[robot voice] No Mexicans detected. [normally] Huh, nothing."
156,15,9,Border Officer 4,"[Richards] Let's face it: they've just about all gotten back across. No matter how hard we tried, the Mexicans all got across the border."
157,15,9,Border Officer 2,"When we asked Obama to stop illegal immigrants, we didn't mean to make the US so shitty they wouldn't wanna come anymore."
158,15,9,"Border Patrol Officers
Officer Charlie
Officer Marcus","[along in the lookout tower, as bored as the others, he suddenly sees something, sits up, and rushes to tell the others.] Hey! Hey wait a minute! [whips out his binoculars and gets a better look.] It's a Mexican! [It's Mantequilla] I think he wants to come back in! [Officer 2 climbs the ladder and gets a better look]"
159,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Oh my God it is! [puts down the binoculars and happily waves his hat at Butters] Hey! Hey! Come on in! [bangs at the tower and whistles] Come on! Come on! Come on, it's okay! [Butters draws closer, smiling. guard 2 addressed the other officers and volunteers] The fuck are you doing?! Get that gate open! [an officer and a volunteer happily oblige. The other officers and volunteers are smiling too]"
160,15,9,Border Officer 5,"Come on, buddy!"
161,15,9,Other Officers,"Come on now, come on! You've got it. [Cartman gets up on the tower and uses his own binoculars]"
162,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute, isn't that..."
163,15,9,Butters Stotch,[looking back at him] Game on!
164,15,9,Eric Cartman,[squints his eyes] Oh no you don't! [takes Officer 2's sidearm and fires at Butters.]
165,15,9,Butters Stotch,[dodging the bullets] AAAH!
166,15,9,Border Officer 2,[takes his weapon back] Fuck are you doin'?!
167,15,9,Eric Cartman,"That asshole is not getting across my border! [Butters either fails to see the open gate, or it was closed while Cartman was firing at him, because he starts climbing the fence. Cartman quickly gets down to intercept him, but decides that electrocuting the fence would get Butters off it, and it works]"
168,15,9,Butters Stotch,AAAAH! [falls and gets up] I'll get over! [runs farther away from the tower]
169,15,9,Eric Cartman,[gives chase] No you won't Butters!
170,15,9,Butters Stotch,"[sees a gray burro and jumps up on him] Giddy up! [gallops away. Cartman gets on a pale gray burro and whistles, and gallops after Butters]"
171,15,9,Mexican Commentator,"Un otro shoto de Mantequilla. Y Manteque-ah. ¡Oh! ¡Una arma! Una arma del El Niño Gordo! [""Another shot of Mantequilla! And Mantequi-ah. Oh! A firearm! The fat kid's firearm!"" Apparently Cartman was firing at Butters]"
172,15,9,Mexicans,Ohhh!
173,15,9,Eric Cartman,Ey!
174,15,9,Mexican Commentator,"Mantequilla ayudar ¡1a Border Patrol! [""The Border Patrol is coming to Mantequilla's aid!"" The Mexicans cheer]"
175,15,9,Eric Cartman,"¡Respeto mi autóridad! [""Respect mah authoritah!"" Again, Cartman is fired upon, and his boat begins to sink. This time, the border patrol is in a helicopter firing away]"
176,15,9,Mexican Commentator,"Border Patrol pegaron ¡El Cero Gordo! [""The border patrol hit the Fat Zero!"" Next, Cartman is on an ATV and stops to look for Butters]"
177,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Where the fuck did he go?! [in the background, Butters can be seen riding by on his burro. Cartman sees him and gives chase. Just before Cartman reaches him, Butters blinks. Cartman jumps off his ATV and tackles Butters off his burro, and they both end up on the desert ground, with Cartman on top] Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose! [Butters apparently collapses] The fuck is this?! [instead of seeing the real Butters, Cartman sees a life-size piñata of him. The head separates from the body and candy falls out] No. NO! [Butters is climbing the fence]"
178,15,9,Butters Stotch,[taunting] Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!
179,15,9,Eric Cartman,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! [Butters goes over the border fence and jumps down]
180,15,9,Butters Stotch,Base! [dances around with his arms outstretched]
181,15,9,Mexicans,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [Butters gets on his knees and slides into a pose]
