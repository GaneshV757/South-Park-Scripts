0,15,5,Phillip,"That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance [sharts on Terrance. Terrance and Phillip laugh, Stan and Kyle laugh]"
1,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[through his laughter] Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!"
2,15,5,Stan Marsh,I know! This is awesome!
3,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,I'm so happy! [wipes off the tip of his nose]
4,15,5,Announcer,Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these messages. [a commercial comes on]
5,15,5,Singer,So much sufferin'... [continues singing in the background. Pictures of babies in bad shape begin to appear]
6,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no! It's that [puts up his right hand to block his view, shuts his eyes and looks away] super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!"
7,15,5,Stan Marsh,What?
8,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! [a baby tries to get his bearing in order to crawl, but slowly collapses. Another one looks in a mirror, then lowers his hed]"
9,15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them."
10,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw dude, that's so sad. [puts up his right hand and looks away]"
11,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Why do they have to put this on TV?! [a doctor carries a baby in order to calm him down]
12,15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"Their world is bleak, lonely, and hopeless. [McLachlan is finally shown] Hello, I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I was famous for two months. Each year, thousands of babies are born addicted to crack and lie in hospitals without a mother to hold them. [more pictures are shown] Won't you volunteer today? Look at these pictures. They need you."
13,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Awww dude, awwww."
14,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Aaaggh, God."
15,15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures. [one of a baby with two boils on his face, another one of a sickly baby crawling]"
16,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! [runs off, leaving Stan on the sofa looking away]"
17,15,5,Nurse,It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
18,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,What exactly can I do to help?
19,15,5,Nurse,"Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now. [a large room full of baby cribs] I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see."
20,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh it's, it's so sad."
21,15,5,Nurse,"Come, come, right over here. [leads him to a therapy room] We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. [the door opens and out walks Cartman]"
22,15,5,Eric Cartman,Oh. Hey Kyle.
23,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[at first surprised, now suspicious] What are you doing here?"
24,15,5,Eric Cartman,I'm volunteering.
25,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,[remains suspicious] ...What are you doing here?!
26,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[firmly] I'm volunteering my time, Kyle."
27,15,5,Nurse,"Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart."
28,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Why do you have a video camera?
29,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?! [to the nurse] Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. [walks away]"
30,15,5,Ms Williams,"Bye, Eric. [Kyle just watches as Cartman goes to the elevator and closes its doors behind him]"
31,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?"
32,15,5,Ms Williams,"Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately."
33,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks. [walks to a window looking over a parking lot. The nurse walks off in the opposite direction]
34,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,What's going on?!
35,15,5,Butters Stotch,[startled] Wuuuuhhhhhh! [falls off the chair]
36,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Ah, crap! [rolls his eyes]"
37,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital."
38,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,So what are you doing?!
39,15,5,Eric Cartman,"What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well."
40,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, what is it?!"
41,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Crack baby basketball. [Kyle pushes his chair away from the table, gets up, and begins to leave] Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us! [Kyle reaches the staurs] We could actually really use you!"
42,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Why do you need me?
43,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping. [Kyle heads downstairs] Dammit! [Kyle leaves the building; Cartman races down the stairs to catch up to him] Kyle, wait I- [Kyle slams the door shut and walks away. Cartman opens it and catches up to Kyle] Kyle, hold on a second!"
44,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,I knew you were doing something terrible!
45,15,5,Eric Cartman,"What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!"
46,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Lots of people will when I tell them!
47,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. [Kyle stops walking, then turns around]"
48,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,You what?
49,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack."
50,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,A thousand dollars.
51,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time."
52,15,5,Eric Cartman,After you. [the other four enter.]
53,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,There's a big wait to sit down.
54,15,5,Denny's Waiter,"Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir."
55,15,5,Eric Cartman,Come on. [the other boys follow]
56,15,5,Eric Cartman,We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
57,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ.
58,15,5,Craig Tucker,It's awesome.
59,15,5,Eric Cartman,"It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials."
60,15,5,Butters Stotch,Every single night.
61,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert."
62,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Wow...
63,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights."
64,15,5,Butters Stotch,"I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now"
65,15,5,Eric Cartman,"You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. [Kyle is about to give in, but still has his doubts. He look down and away]"
66,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you."
67,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away from the window and walks a few steps] And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side."
68,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. [pats Kyle on the shoulder and walks away. Kyle walks back to the window and looks out over the street below. He smiles]"
69,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Go long, Token! Go go! [Token runs across the yard. Stan throws the ball and Token catches it]"
70,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest."
71,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Wow, really? [takes the money and starts counting it]"
72,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff."
73,15,5,Stan Marsh,Doing what?
74,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Crack baby... basketball.
75,15,5,Stan Marsh,[somewhat startled] ...Dude.
76,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out. [leads Kyle inside and to his room, then gets on the computer and goes to a Web site.] See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular! [soon, babies are heard. Kyle is showing Stan one of the Crack Baby Fight videos] I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before. [Stan stays quiet] It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits. [Stan stays quiet] Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?"
77,15,5,Eric Cartman,Betsy MacIntosh?
78,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,Whatta you want?
79,15,5,Eric Cartman,We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
80,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,Oh Gohhhd.
81,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We need to speak with you, ma'am. [she allows them to come in, and they sit on the sofa while she sits in the armchair.]"
82,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.
83,15,5,Eric Cartman,And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
84,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop! [begins to cry]
85,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[looks at Butters and smiles] Well ma'am, I have some exciting news. [takes his briefcase and opens it, taking out a letter] We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. [Butters claps in approval]"
86,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,[takes the letter and reads it] The what?
87,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?"
88,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,They said it's a boy.
89,15,5,Eric Cartman,[holds out a pen] Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
90,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,How much will he make?
91,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules."
92,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.
93,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-"
94,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,Cain't you change the rules?
95,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? [Butters smiles, reaches for his briefcase, and opens it]"
96,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need. [glances at Stan] Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything. [glances at Stan again] Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? [glances at Stan and waits a bit longer for a reply]"
97,15,5,Stan Marsh,...You sound like Cartmam.
98,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[puts his right hand on his stomach as if punched there] Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!"
99,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too."
100,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit! [frightens himself and glances at Stan, then look away] Okay, so, see ya. [goes out the front door and closes it behind him]"
101,15,5,Eric Cartman,It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
102,15,5,Clyde Donovan,We're just having a hard time finding him.
103,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[slams his fists on the table] Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now! [a shot of Slash on the TV on the wall] Now you guys get down there- [the phone rings] Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go! [Craig and Clyde turn around and leave] Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well. [As Clyde and Craig go downstairs, Kyle comes upstairs. Kyle looks pissed as he stops at Cartman's desk] Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too. [softly] Hey Kyle. Have a seat."
104,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,I need to talk to you. [puts a folder down on the desk]
105,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye. [hangs up] How's it goin', man?"
106,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,[opens the folder] In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
107,15,5,Eric Cartman,They can't make money. It's against the rules.
108,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
109,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing."
110,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Gut they're the ones risking injury.
111,15,5,Eric Cartman,"What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!"
112,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"The government could come after us, Cartman."
113,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We're a non-profit company, Kyle."
114,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
115,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. [shows him to the newest addition to the office]"
116,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,A hot tub?!
117,15,5,Eric Cartman,"It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. [Kyle goes up the steps, dips his finger into the liquid, and tastes it]"
118,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Gravy?
119,15,5,Eric Cartman,Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
120,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,No way.
121,15,5,Eric Cartman,"A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime? [pretty soon they're both in the hot tub. A lot of McDonald's french fries sit behind them.] Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine""."
122,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal."
123,15,5,Eric Cartman,It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
124,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,What other companies?
125,15,5,Secretary,"[off-screen] Dean Howland, a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you."
126,15,5,Dean Howland,"A what? Send him in. [the doors open and in walks Cartman, dressed as a Southern gentleman]"
127,15,5,Eric Cartman,[speaking like a Georgia plantation owner] Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
128,15,5,Dean Howland,In the what?
129,15,5,Eric Cartman,"My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself, [opens a humidor and takes out a cigar] I am also in the slave trade. [takes a long whiff of the sealed cigar, then puts it into his inside coat pocket and pats it down] But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets."
130,15,5,Dean Howland,I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.
131,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks over to a picture of the UCB basketball team] You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks."
132,15,5,Dean Howland,Are you referring to our student athletes?
133,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?"
134,15,5,Dean Howland,"Look, there are [catches his breath] good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man."
135,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?"
136,15,5,Dean Howland,"We do [slams his fist on his desk] not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves."
137,15,5,Eric Cartman,"But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight. [clears his throat] Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu. [waits a few seconds, then takes off his hat and softly says] Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves."
138,15,5,Dean Howland,Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!
139,15,5,Eric Cartman,"You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?! [walks towards the entrance and opens the door] This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! [walks out and closes the door]"
140,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies. [Stan just blinks, still half-awake. Kyle turns and looks at him] Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!"
141,15,5,Stan Marsh,[blinks sleepily] McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
142,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! [turns around and walks out]
143,15,5,Eric Cartman,"How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!"
144,15,5,Clyde Donovan,We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
145,15,5,Eric Cartman,How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
146,15,5,Clyde Donovan,We don't know. He's everywhere.
147,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!"
148,15,5,Craig Tucker,"Oh, that's a good idea."
149,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime! [slams the receiver down on the base] Jesus Christ! [Kyle walks in with a stand and some schematics] Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!"
150,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[setting up] Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies."
151,15,5,Eric Cartman,...What?
152,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!"
153,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!"
154,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,...What?
155,15,5,Eric Cartman,"This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! [hugs Kyle, who is quite puzzled at Cartman's reaction]"
156,15,5,Postmaster,Let me get this straight. You kids want me to tell you where Slash lives?
157,15,5,Craig Tucker,"Please sir, it's very important."
158,15,5,Postmaster,"Well I'm afraid I can't do that, kids."
159,15,5,Clyde Donovan,But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
160,15,5,Postmaster,"Come on! Kids write to Slash every day, but it all just goes into this big pile over here. [leads them to the pile] The reason I can't tell you where Slash lives is because he don't live nowhere. Don't you ever wonder how Slash can be aaall those places at the same time? It's because he's made up! He-"
161,15,5,Postman,"Don't spoil it for the kids, Marty. It's up to parents to tell their children Slash ain't real. [Craig and Clyde look at each other]"
162,15,5,Roger Donovan,Hullo?
163,15,5,Clyde Donovan,"Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?"
164,15,5,Roger Donovan,Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash.
165,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"[turns around] Oooo well, the day had to come."
166,15,5,Roger Donovan,"Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?"
167,15,5,Clyde Donovan,Slash isn't real.
168,15,5,Craig Tucker,Get out of here.
169,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"[takes the phone] Clyde, sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters. He's not really a lie, he's like ahh..."
170,15,5,Roger Donovan,[takes the phone back] Er he's like love. People all over the world dress up like Slash and have different names for Slash. The Dutch call him Vunter Slash.
171,15,5,Clyde Donovan,He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
172,15,5,Roger Donovan,"Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?"
173,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,Vunter Slash kapunshka
174,15,5,Both Parents,Shpielerin manshunshka
175,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course. [gets no reaction from Stan] Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?"
176,15,5,Clyde Donovan,[arriving with Craig] You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. [he has a book under his arm]
177,15,5,Eric Cartman,What?
178,15,5,Craig Tucker,"Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids."
179,15,5,Butters Stotch,Slash is make-believe??
180,15,5,Clyde Donovan,"Here, look for yourself. [plops the book onto the booth table] He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. [a book of his story is shown, with pious images of Slash]"
181,15,5,Eric Cartman,Vunter Slash?
182,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
183,15,5,Eric Cartman,"But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?"
184,15,5,Clyde Donovan,One of our parents.
185,15,5,Eric Cartman,"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?"
186,15,5,Clyde Donovan,One of our parents!
187,15,5,Eric Cartman,Are you fucking serious? [no one speaks for a few seconds]
188,15,5,Stan Marsh,You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. [leaves the table]
189,15,5,Eric Cartman,You knew about this??
190,15,5,Stan Marsh,[stands next to Craig and Clyde] My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. [blinks his eyes and walks away. The others are dumbstruck for several seconds]
191,15,5,Butters Stotch,Well what the heck do we do now?
192,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!"
193,15,5,Mr Peters,"[speaking with the same Southern accent Cartman used earlier] Boys, I want to thank you for bringin' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You've made us a lohhht of monih."
194,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
195,15,5,Mr Peters,"[serves himself a drink] Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn't get nothin'. Why, you boys got experience, didn'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves. I'd give you some free video games, but it's against the rules. [smokes a cigar]"
196,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
197,15,5,Mr Peters,"Oh, well, fuck 'em. And fuck you too. I piss in your faces. [smokes the cigar again. The boys are dumbstruck for a few seconds]"
198,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I just can't believe Slash isn't real,"
199,15,5,Butters Stotch,I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
200,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!"
201,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me."
202,15,5,Mr Peters,"[sits in his chair and puts his feet up on the desk] Well boys, this has been real educational and all, but now let's part with that old EA Sports sayin': ""Get the fuck out of my buildin'!"""
203,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go. [something grabs his attention] No way! [a brand new building is shown: ""South Park Orphanage for Crack Babies""] This is it!"
204,15,5,Stan Marsh,It's what?
205,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"This is it, Stan! [runs across the street and enters the orphanage. Stan trails behind. Several workers are putting up wallpaper] It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh, [sees Ms. Williams] excuse me, what is this place?"
206,15,5,Ms Williams,Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.
207,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,But who paid for all this? [Stan catches up and the nurse leaves]
208,15,5,Stan Marsh,"[tugs at Kyle's coat] Kyle, Kyle! Look. [in a corner sits one of Slash's hats and one of his guitars]"
209,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
210,15,5,Stan Marsh,Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
