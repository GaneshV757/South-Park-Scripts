0,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?"
1,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,I didn't see the game.
2,15,11,Randy Marsh,[soft sneeze] You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
3,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
4,15,11,Randy Marsh,A musical? [laughs and rises from his chair to approach him] Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! [laughs while moving around the desk]
5,15,11,Worker 1,"[bearded] Good for you, Nelson. Did you get a blowjob afterwards?"
6,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,Sure did.
7,15,11,Worker 2,[clean-shaven] Niice. [Randy's smile turns into a frown]
8,15,11,Randy Marsh,What?
9,15,11,Worker 1,I took my girl to see that show last week. Got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards.
10,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,Forty-five minutes non-stop.
11,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[surprised, then] Nuh uh."
12,15,11,Worker 2,It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
13,15,11,Randy Marsh,[looks back at him for a few seconds] Noh uh.
14,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,"I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome."
15,15,11,Randy Marsh,Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
16,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,Wicked.
17,15,11,Randy Marsh,[interested] Oh. Wicked.
18,15,11,Singers and Actors,"...Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe, she was just wicked people
Head to toe...
She wasn't good, to know what goodness is..."
19,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?"
20,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Nono, I'm good, thanks."
21,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Okay, I'll be right back. [gets up and heads for the aisle, passing a couple on the way] 'Scuse me, sorry. [leaves the auditorium]"
22,15,11,Randy Marsh,Can I get a scotch and soda? [the bartender goes off to prepare it]
23,15,11,Man 1,Enjoying the show?
24,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[nervous at first] Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected."
25,15,11,Man 1,No?
26,15,11,Randy Marsh,"To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening."
27,15,11,Man 1,"Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is ""blowjob."""
28,15,11,Randy Marsh,Subliminal messages?
29,15,11,Man 1,"It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it ""subtext."" Just listen really, really closely."
30,15,11,The Wizard of Oz,"While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!"
31,15,11,Singers and Actors,"Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me"
32,15,11,Witches,Now let's try ... defying ................... gravity ...
33,15,11,Male,"....... Look at them ... becoming friends ... here in Oz, you love blowjobs."
34,15,11,Witches,And new loves cry ... defying ................... gravity ...
35,15,11,Male,....... Suddenly ... Don't you love free love blowjobs?
36,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head. [swoons a bit, then looks at Randy, then at his crotch, then at him again] Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? [looks at his crotch again. Randy looks at her in surprise. She giggles and takes off her seatbelt, then leans over and begins to give him a blowjob]"
37,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[softly] Whoa, no way!"
38,15,11,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Larry! [Larry continues crying] Dude, why does this happen every time?"
39,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"Do something, you stupid vegan!"
40,15,11,Eric Cartman,Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
41,15,11,Randy Marsh,"You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!"
42,15,11,Man 2,How long was it?
43,15,11,Randy Marsh,"She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes."
44,15,11,Worker 2,"Nice, bro!"
45,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it."
46,15,11,Stephen Stotch,What was the show about?
47,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something."
48,15,11,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! [Shelly walks up the little ladder to the board and jumps up and down]"
49,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"Go! Go! [Larry bounces up and down crying, but doesn't fall into the water]"
50,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now."
51,15,11,Worker 2,"Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!"
52,15,11,Randy Marsh,Really??
53,15,11,Worker 1,"Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker."
54,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?"
55,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"[gets off the chair] What?? Randy, are you serious??"
56,15,11,Randy Marsh,[walks up to Sharon and hugs her] I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
57,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?"
58,15,11,Stan Marsh,"Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?"
59,15,11,Randy Marsh,Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
60,15,11,Shelly Marsh,Not the vegans!
61,15,11,Stan Marsh,No. Dad. Please don't do this!
62,15,11,Mr Feegan,"It takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world! You get labeled ""soft"" or ""silly."" [he must have been talking for a while, for Stan and Shelly look bored] But the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products. Would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan?"
63,15,11,Shelly Marsh,Yes.
64,15,11,Mr Feegan,"Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!"
65,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. [Larry is stunned and drops his fork, then looks as his parents' reactions. His parents are stunned too, but grow angry]"
66,15,11,Mr Feegan,He does decide for himself! Larry's been a vegan since he was born! [Larry waves at her to keep going]
67,15,11,Shelly Marsh,Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. [Larry signals for her to keep 'em coming]
68,15,11,Mr Feegan,"You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets."
69,15,11,Stan Marsh,"[just outside the dining room on the phone with Randy while Mr. Feegan speaks.] Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out. [no answer] Please answer the phone Dad. [no answer. He looks around] Dad?"
70,15,11,Country Singer,"Man time! I need some Man Time!
I got the horses fed and the truck locked up, been workin' my fingers to the bone.
Now I need a little bit of man time, gonna see me a Broadway show!"
71,15,11,Female Sailor,Anything goes
72,15,11,Male Sailor 1,Blowjob!
73,15,11,Female Sailor,Anything goes
74,15,11,Male Sailor 2,Blowjob!
75,15,11,Singers and Actors,Man time!
76,15,11,Females,Hear things more clearly
77,15,11,Males,Day blowjob day!
78,15,11,Country Singer,"I'm about to get drunk and loud, gonna have me a rowdy good time.
All I need is my girl and my truck and some Rodgers and Hammerstein!"
79,15,11,Christine,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
80,15,11,The Phantom of the Opera leads (Christine and the Phantom),"''Sing, my angel of blowjob music!"
81,15,11,Female,But the tigers come at night!
82,15,11,Male,On you bed
83,15,11,Singers and Actors,Man time!
84,15,11,Males,"...........job, blowjob."
85,15,11,Females,"It's cold up here, I'm locked up here"
86,15,11,Singers and Actors,Man time!
87,15,11,Singers and Actors,Man time!
88,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!"
89,15,11,Man 2,"Sounds like a dream, bro."
90,15,11,Randy Marsh,"It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is ""Wicked"" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times."
91,15,11,Worker 1,And Wicked moves to Seattle in a couple of weeks.
92,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
93,15,11,Stephen Stotch,Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
94,15,11,Randy Marsh,Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
95,15,11,Bob Black,Huh?
96,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[gets up and walks off a bit] Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town."
97,15,11,Lady 1,"[dressed in cyan]
O what a glorious Sunday. I know what I'd like to do with my time.
''[walks up to man nearby]
Would you like a blowjob?"
98,15,11,Man 3,Yes I would like a blowjob [smiles]
99,15,11,Both,Nothing beats a blowjob on football Sunday.
100,15,11,Lady 1,"[approaches a man on a bench] Excuse me, I'm the queen of blowjobs."
101,15,11,Man 4,Really? I would love a blowjob.
102,15,11,All,A woman should give blowjobs on football Sunday
103,15,11,Lady 1,"I want to be covered in semen on a bed in the Hotel Jerome
[the park bench is pulled away and the actors gather around her]
A woman is prettiest covered in semen."
104,15,11,All,Give you husband a blowjob when you get home.
105,15,11,Man 4,"[to Lady 2, dressed in pink] And what about you, my fair lady? Could I trouble you for a quick Lewinsky?"
106,15,11,Lady 2,"Oh I don't know, kind sir. Blowjobs seem a little degrading to me."
107,15,11,Man 4,"Come now, a blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart."
108,15,11,Men,Now get on your knees and put that heart to work!
109,15,11,All,"Blowjobs, give up your blowjobs."
110,15,11,Men,"You're guilty at blowjobs, you love giving blowjobs"
111,15,11,Women,"... Blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs"
112,15,11,Singers and Actors,So what could be better on a football Sunday? What could be better on a football Sunday?
113,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"What do you want, Larry? [Larry raises the daisy up slowly, presenting it to her]"
114,15,11,Larry Feegan,"Today, I went to 7-11 and I ate a Slim Jim. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. Nobody ever stood up for me before. [sets the daisy on the landing, then turns around and trots off. Shelly looks on in wonder]"
115,15,11,Lady 1,Oh Reginald! How about a hummer at halftime? A Super Bowl suckle from me?
116,15,11,Reginald,A Supwerbowl hummer at halftime from my lovely blowjob queen!
117,15,11,Both,Two people in love it's amazing. Tim Tebow please don't let us down. How about a hummer at halftime-?
118,15,11,Representative,Mr. Randy Marsh?
119,15,11,Randy Marsh,"And hold! [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there. [to the representative] Uhh, this better be important."
120,15,11,Representative,It is. I represent some of the biggest names in all of Broadway. They wish to speak with you.
121,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Really? Oh my Gaw! [to the cast] Take a break, guys. this could be it!"
122,15,11,Representative,"Mr. Marsh, this is Andrew Lloyd Webber [eating a drumstick]"
123,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,Helleow.
124,15,11,Representative,Stephen Schwartz
125,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,[gruffly] Hey bro.
126,15,11,Representative,Mr. Elton John. [Elton John belches] and Stephen Sondheim.
127,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,Sup bro?
128,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Not much, sup with you guys?"
129,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"No. I mean, ""sup, bro!"""
130,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Sit down, Mr. Marsh, we need to have a talk. [Randy takes a seat]"
131,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
132,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs."
133,15,11,Elton John,You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!
134,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,Musicals are about subtext!
135,15,11,Randy Marsh,My musical has lots of subtext.
136,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"""A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work."""
137,15,11,Randy Marsh,And then she does. It's a metaphor.
138,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,"Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen""?!"
139,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!
140,15,11,Randy Marsh,[rises] Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
141,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!"
142,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards! [rises, moving his chair aside] And now I need to get back to rehearsals. [leaves, then stops and turns around] Oh. And if ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. [turns around and walks out]"
143,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"What do you want, Larry? [he begins to play her a tune]"
144,15,11,Larry Feegan,"You make me come out of my shell, Shelly.
You give me strength where there was only fear
I ate at a Burger King today, Shelly
And stood up to a boy who called me ""queer""
When you pushed me off the diving board I
...fell.
And you make the world a nicer place, Shelly
So I can come out of my... shell.
[sets the guitar on the landing, then slowly takes off his life preserver and sets it on the landing as well. He turns around and trots off again. He makes a right on the sidewalk and runs]"
145,15,11,Shelly Marsh,Hey! [Larry stops and looks back] Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? [Larry turns around]
146,15,11,Singers and Actors,"Blow--- job--- Queen!
Don't stop giving that blowjob. Even when you're tired, don't stop! Don't stop!
Shaaaaroooon!"
147,15,11,Worker 2,"[leads the group of Randy's friends] Randy! Randy, brah!"
148,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[to the cast] Uh, and hold. [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. [the actors are frozen in place] What is it now?"
149,15,11,Worker 2,"Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down."
150,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[stunned at first, then gets angry] Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! [leaves the table and walks up the aisle towards the exit]"
151,15,11,Worker 2,"Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him."
152,15,11,Randy Marsh,[quietly] Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
153,15,11,Man 2,"Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!"
154,15,11,Randy Marsh,I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this! [turns] Let's bro down! [goes out the doors]
155,15,11,Larry Feegan,"Oh no, you built another settlement?"
156,15,11,Shelly Marsh,And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
157,15,11,Larry Feegan,[laughing merrily] Oh wow!
158,15,11,Mrs Feegan,"They're having such a great time together. I really wanna thank you, Sharon."
159,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too."
160,15,11,Mrs Feegan,"I have to admit it makes me a little nervous having Larry up there without a life preserver on, but I guess we have to take changes sometimes."
161,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical."
162,15,11,Mrs Feegan,"That's right, I, I hear his musical is getting a lot of attention, that it really has a chance of making it."
163,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim."
164,15,11,Randy Marsh,Whassup brah?!
165,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,What brah?!
166,15,11,Randy Marsh,Sup brah?!
167,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Take a swing, brah!"
168,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Right here, brah! [they continue circling each other]"
169,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Let's go, Sondheim! Wipe the street with his punk ass!"
170,15,11,Randy Marsh,What makes you the brauthority brah?!
171,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"West Side Story, brah!"
172,15,11,Randy Marsh,What brah?!
173,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Sweeney Todd, brah!"
174,15,11,Randy Marsh,What brah?! What brah?!
175,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Merrily We Rode Along, bro! Why you gotta disrespect, bro?!"
176,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I do respect you, bro!"
177,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Show some respect, bro!"
178,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I do respect you, bro!"
179,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Then stop disrespectin', bro!"
180,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I respect you, bro!"
181,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Okay, I respect you too!"
182,15,11,Randy Marsh,Okay! [the two men stay quiet begin to relax]
183,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,The bro down is over! Let's bro out!
184,15,11,Spectator,Bro out!
185,15,11,Spectator 2,Party people!
186,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!"
187,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,That's what bros fuckin' do!
188,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical."
189,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey, really??"
190,15,11,Elton John,"Yeh. We can help youse out a li'l bit with the subtext. [checks out a waitress as she passes by - first her breasts, then her face]"
191,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,"How about instead of ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" we call it... ""The Woman In White"""
192,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Oh, that is beautiful!"
193,15,11,Bros,[all approve] Yeeeeeeeah!
194,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,And a cheer to Randy Marsh. Welcome... to Bro'dway.
195,15,11,Randy Marsh,Bro'dwaaay!
196,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,Wooooooooooo!
197,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,Woohoo!
198,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Ooof. [rubs the back of his head for a moment, then walks by the sofa, where Sharon is reading a book]"
199,15,11,Sharon Marsh,Hey hun.
200,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Hi babe. Sorry, I'm... [stops behind the sofa] kind of hanging out with the guys."
201,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?"
202,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it."
203,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you."
204,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?"
205,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Of course not, go ahead, hun."
206,15,11,Randy Marsh,[heads for the stairs] Alright babe.
207,15,11,Sharon Marsh,I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
208,15,11,Randy Marsh,Okay. What's Shelly doing?
209,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"I gave her those tickets to ""Wicked."" [Randy stops and looks back at Sharon] She's seeing it with her little boyfriend."
210,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[does a double take, then plants his hands on the bannister] She's WHAT?!"
211,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see ""Wicked"" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical."
212,15,11,Randy Marsh,OH! [runs back outside] Shelly! Hold on! [closes the door. Sharon just watches him go and smiles]
213,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!"
214,15,11,Randy Marsh,"AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see ""Wicked""?!"
215,15,11,Sharon Marsh,Why does it matter?!
216,15,11,Randy Marsh,She's too young for that stuff!
217,15,11,Sharon Marsh,Too young?!
218,15,11,Randy Marsh,This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
219,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!"
220,15,11,Randy Marsh,I can't!
221,15,11,Sharon Marsh,WHY?!
222,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext."
223,15,11,Sharon Marsh,[crosses her arms and looks away] That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
224,15,11,Randy Marsh,"D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw ""Wicked""?"
225,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-"
226,15,11,Randy Marsh,"And after ""Lion King"" in New York? ""Godspell""? ""Mamma Mia""?"
227,15,11,Sharon Marsh,Oh my gosh.
228,15,11,Randy Marsh,Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
229,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured."
230,15,11,Randy Marsh,"No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry."
231,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw ""Grease"" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we- [gasps and puts her hands over her heart] Oh my God!"
232,15,11,Randy Marsh,AAAA!
233,15,11,Sharon Marsh,AAAA!
234,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Shelly! [steps on the gas pedal, and the car goes past 60 mph]"
235,15,11,Singers and Actors,"No one cares about wicked people.
Now she's gone but we don't care.
And are we gonna live in peace, and all live free, you'll see.
O Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe-"
236,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[stopping by random rows] Shelly? Shelly? [he finds her and gets to her row] Shelly, come on. We have to go!"
237,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"Dad, what are you doing here?"
238,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Right now, Shelly! [A woman sitting by the aisle shushes him] Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!"
239,15,11,Elderly Man,Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!
240,15,11,Randy Marsh,Oh you fucking pervert!
241,15,11,Usher,"Alright, get the hell out of here, you! [he and another usher haul him away]"
242,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Shelly! [the two ushers take him outside and away from the playhouse, then push him away.]"
243,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy! [Randy gets up and smashes a window open with his left elbow, then reaches in. Sharon turns away so she doesn't get hit with shards of glass, then turns back] Randy, what are you doing?!"
244,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[bent over, putting on a costume] It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! [gets up dressed as Spider-Man, and puts on the mask last. He runs back into the playhouse]"
245,15,11,The Wizard of Oz,"While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!"
246,15,11,Singers and Actors,"Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me"
247,15,11,Audience Member,Ohhhh.
248,15,11,Audience Member,"Hey, it's Spider-Man"
249,15,11,Randy Marsh,Sorry! Sorry.
250,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Agh! [swings onto one of the side balconies, knocking out a man. Randy gets his bearings on a rail and swings back towards the orchestra pit. He knocks out the conductor and finds himself dangling from a chandelier, the cable wrapped around his right ankle. The stage lights go out and the house lights come on]"
251,15,11,Announcer,"Sorry folks, we are in a hold. We are in a hold."
252,15,11,Audience Member,Awwwwww. [And that ends that showing]
253,15,11,Field Reporter,The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater. [one of the actors is being led to an ambulance] The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver. [Shelly begins to sob softly]
254,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[looks in, then opens the door some more and enters] Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. [backs out and closes the door]"
255,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[glancing at Sharon from time to time] It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy! [looks at Sharon] I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you. [lies down] I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad."
256,15,11,Sharon Marsh,I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
257,15,11,Randy Marsh,Really?
258,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"[sits up] Oh Randy, [kneels before him. Randy sits up] the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing."
259,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[rises and kneels before her] Oh Sharon, you're the best. [they laugh and hug each other]"
260,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?"
261,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier."
262,15,11,Announcer,"""The Book of Mormon."" You'll get a blowjob."
