0,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?"
1,13,1,Stan Marsh,"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me."
2,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's just so astounding."
3,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened. [the boys are looking at Kenny and a girl eating alone together at another table.] Kenny has a girlfriend."
4,13,1,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend."
5,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
6,13,1,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, so, w-who is she?"
7,13,1,Eric Cartman,Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
8,13,1,Butters Stotch,"[runs up to the boys' table] Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!"
9,13,1,Stan Marsh,What?
10,13,1,Butters Stotch,"[panting softly] Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!"
11,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader."
12,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Um, does Kenny like her?"
13,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever."
14,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, no. Oh, geez!"
15,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[getting irritated] Butters, what's the problem?"
16,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's."
17,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
18,13,1,Butters Stotch,"It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. ""Tammy Warner is a total slut!"""
19,13,1,Eric Cartman,"That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!"
20,13,1,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me."
21,13,1,Stan Marsh,"[sighs] All right, come on, guys. [leaves the table with Kyle and Cartman.]"
22,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?"
23,13,1,Girl 1,"So, anyway, I passed him a note, but then Johnny... [Kenny walks alone down a different hall. Stan catches up to him]"
24,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! [Kyle and Cartman are with him]"
25,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh, hi, guys.)"
26,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend."
27,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(What about her?)
28,13,1,Stan Marsh,"[sighs and lowers his head] Oh, boy."
29,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but..."
30,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(But what?)
31,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"W-well, we've heard that she's..."
32,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Kenny. [deep sigh, puts his right hand on Kenny's back for sympathy] Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's."
33,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"[afraid, high voice] (Huh?)"
34,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Your girlfriend's a slut, dude."
35,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) [jumps for joy, dances down the hall, makes a right and runs off.]"
36,13,1,Eric Cartman,[moments later] He took it pretty well.
37,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"[cheerfully] (Hey, Tammy!)"
38,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?"
39,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)"
40,13,1,Tammy Warner,TGI Friday's?
41,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yep. I like the food!)
42,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Yeah, okay. But... [walks away a few steps] Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true. [Kenny dances with glee, but Tammy doesn't see this. She gets apologetic] But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault! [Kenny stops dancing] See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers."
43,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Jonas Brothers?)
44,13,1,Tammy Warner,"You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control. [Kenny starts dancing again] And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's, [Kenny stops] and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken? [Kenny walks up to her, puts a consoling hand on her shoulder, and sighs]"
45,13,1,Clerk,"There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert."
46,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Thanks.) [turns around and walks out with his tickets]
47,13,1,Eric Cartman,"The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? [Kenny continues walking, the other three join him as he walks across the parking lot]"
48,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
49,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)"
50,13,1,Stan Marsh,A B.J.?
51,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
52,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Of course, dude!)"
53,13,1,Eric Cartman,[forcibly stops Kenny] Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
54,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, that's gross."
55,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[turns right and leaves the other boys behind] (I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
56,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,What kind of protection?
57,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)"
58,13,1,Clerk 2,"Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?"
59,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)"
60,13,1,Clerk 2,"These here? Why, certainly. [The Clerk reaches for a box on a rack and hands it to Kenny. Kenny reads the cover: ""Big Mamba. The world's #1 condom. Trusted for over 50 years.""]"
61,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Cool!) [Kenny pays for the condoms and turns to head out the door]
62,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?"
63,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)"
64,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[reaches out to Kenny and stops him] Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?"
65,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yep! Woo-hoo!) [skips away]
66,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome? [the lights go out and cameras begin to take pictures of the stage. Soon the stage lights come up and the Jonas Brothers appear. The girls go wild]"
67,13,1,Joe Jonas,"I'm ready to get it on.
But there's no gettin' on until I'm ready.
Too soon, slow down.
Take it easy, oh, my girl, I need your love. Bay-bay!"
68,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I can't wait till the day I kiss you.
Until then I have to tease you.
'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty.
She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty."
69,13,1,Joe,Bay-bay! I'm hot.
70,13,1,Nick Jonas,He's hot.
71,13,1,Little Girl,[putting her hands over her crotch] My 'giney tickles! [she scratches her crotch to stop the tickles. Most other girls do the same thing]
72,13,1,Tammy Warner,"[grabs onto Kenny's parka] Oh, my God. It's that tingling again. [a girl has left her seat and is in an aisle gyrating her butt up and down. Tammy gets up on her seat and screams towards the band] I love you! [she's shocked at what she just said, then begins dancing in her seat. Kenny sits in his seat unenthused, wondering when the payoff is coming.]"
73,13,1,Joe,Tell me how was I to know?
74,13,1,Jonas Brothers,You'd take your love and go.
75,13,1,Joe,Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
76,13,1,Jonas Brothers,To put my arm around you?
77,13,1,Joe,The seasons change.
78,13,1,Kevin Jonas,Bay-bay!
79,13,1,Joe,And the world goes round.
80,13,1,Nick,The world goes round and round and round.
81,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time.
Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause,
yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow.
And then someday we can get it on.
Until then, go back to Montreal."
82,13,1,Joe,"'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!"
83,13,1,Nick,"Love you, bay-bay!"
84,13,1,Kevin,Bay-bay!
85,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Whoooooo! [a toddler makes her way towards the stage by climbing over the rows of cheering girls] Aaah-oww! [in another seat Mr. Slave is masturbating with his left hand as he reaches towards the stage with his right one.] You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!"
86,13,1,The Jonas Brothers,"Good night, Denver. We love you all! [skips off the stage] We love you, Denver! [skips off the stage] Good night! [skips off the stage]"
87,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!"
88,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) [grabs her hand and they walked towards the exit]"
89,13,1,An Usher At the Pepsi Center concert,"And, uh, you too, little girl in the red."
90,13,1,Tammy Warner,[looks over her shoulder] Huh?
91,13,1,An Usher At the Pepsi Center concert,"Band would like you to come backstage. You, too, little girl in the puppy T-shirt. [the blonde girl looks down at her shirt, shrieks, and makes her way to the usher]"
92,13,1,Tammy Warner,"They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!"
93,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"[pulling at Tammy] (No, no, we're going to your place now!)"
94,13,1,Tammy Warner,It's a dream come true! [Tammy lets go of Kenny and goes down the aisle towards the usher]
95,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[gives chase] (Hey!)
96,13,1,An Usher At the Pepsi Center concert,"All right, right this way, girls."
97,13,1,Roadie,"Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you. [quickly blocks Kenny from entering.] Uh, not you. [kicks Kenny aside a few times]"
98,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(No, fuck that, dude! I bought the fucking tickets!) [the roadie closes the door and Kenny starts pounding on it] (Hey! What the fuck?!)"
99,13,1,Roadie 2,"[in a sensuous voice] The Jonas Brothers will be right out, girls. [leaves]"
100,13,1,Girl in Puppy T shirt,Why do you think they called us back here?
101,13,1,Fat Girl,They must-a wanna have sex with us.
102,13,1,Tammy Warner,What? You think so?
103,13,1,Fat Girl,"Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs."
104,13,1,Girl in Puppy T shirt,"Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!"
105,13,1,Girl in O T shirt,"Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!"
106,13,1,Tammy Warner,Me neither. [suddenly the brothers appear]
107,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"Hey, there, girls! [all of a sudden the girls' mouths pop open as their jaws drop. As the brothers talk, they strike poses]"
108,13,1,Joe,"Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience."
109,13,1,Nick,"Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there."
110,13,1,Fat Girl,Let's just get to the blowjobs.
111,13,1,Joe,Blow what?
112,13,1,Kevin,"[to his brothers] I don't know. [to the girls] Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you."
113,13,1,Nick,And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.
114,13,1,Tammy Warner,[perplexed] Purity rings?
115,13,1,Joe,We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
116,13,1,Kevin,And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.
117,13,1,Nick,That's just how we roll.
118,13,1,Kevin,Yeah.
119,13,1,Nick,"Yeah. [they high-five each other. In a wide shot, we see Kenny peering in on the exchange through a transom window.]"
120,13,1,Joe,"So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?"
121,13,1,The Girls,[mesmerized] Okay.
122,13,1,Kevin,"And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll."
123,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear."
124,13,1,Stan Marsh,"So how did it go last night? [Kenny breathes in deep and sighs, takes off his left glove and shows the other boys the purity ring Tammy gave him]"
125,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
126,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(A purity ring.)
127,13,1,Eric Cartman,Purity ring?
128,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)"
129,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"...Well, what does that mean?"
130,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
131,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-"
132,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
133,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex."
134,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah.) [Kenny crosses his arms and tries his best to be agreeable with Kyle, but looks at his left ring finger and uncrosses his arms, breaking the act] (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) [Kenny walks away bawling. The other boys just watch him leave]"
135,13,1,Butters Stotch,[runs up to the boys] Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
136,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now."
137,13,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh, what's that?"
138,13,1,Stan Marsh,They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
139,13,1,Butters Stotch,[gets pensive] Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
140,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true.
I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble, 
'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other.
But who needs sex and drugs and partying 
When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix...
Bay-bay!
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave.
No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break.
I made a commitment and it is forever, 
So we can spend every waking minute together.
And if we get bored it won't be a problem, 
'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings...
Bay-bay!"
141,13,1,Purity Boy 1,"Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?"
142,13,1,Purity Boy 2,"You know? What Carole and I enjoy is Grey's Anatomy. We love Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Carole?"
143,13,1,Purity Boy 3,"We adore Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Nancy?"
144,13,1,Nancy,"Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch Grey's Anatomy?"
145,13,1,Purity Boy 1,We look forward to it all week long. [chuckles. Sarah laughs with him]
146,13,1,Purity Boy 3,Sure is sweet.
147,13,1,Purity Boy 1,It's the most fun I've had in weeks. [laughter]
148,13,1,Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
What I cannot do.
Bay... bay...
Baaay...
Baybay.
Baybay.
Baaaybaaaaay."
149,13,1,Director,"Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys."
150,13,1,Joe,This is bullpucky!
151,13,1,Kevin,"Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!"
152,13,1,Director,"Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem."
153,13,1,Joe,"Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!"
154,13,1,Kevin,"Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe."
155,13,1,Disney Exec 1,"Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image."
156,13,1,Joe,We don't care about the company.
157,13,1,Director,And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
158,13,1,Kevin,We aren'--we aren't afraid of him.
159,13,1,Disney Exec 2,"Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now."
160,13,1,Disney Exec 3,"[looks out the door] Oh Jesus, he's here. The boss is here!"
161,13,1,Kevin,"Let's be strong, guys."
162,13,1,Disney Exec 3,[opens the door just a crack and looks out again] Hello sir. How was your trip? [the door flies open and in walks a swaggering Mickey Mouse]
163,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[looks around] What's all this I'm hearing about not wearing the purity rings, haha?"
164,13,1,Director,Uh we'll just leave you alone. [he and the other executives clear out of the room]
165,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?"
166,13,1,Kevin,We... need to talk about something.
167,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha."
168,13,1,Joe,"Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings."
169,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha."
170,13,1,Joe,Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
171,13,1,Mickey Mouse,The rings stay on!
172,13,1,Joe,"Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. [Mickey walks over and punches him in the balls. Joe groans and falls forward to the ground]"
173,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[Mickey kicks Joe's his body with every accented word] You DON'T... FUCKING...TALK to me...Like THAT, haha. You LITTLE... PIECE of... SHIT, Haha! [Joe coughs up some blood] Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha. [Joe begins to stand, then gets some help from his brother. Mickey wipes his gloves clean] Now, do we have a problem?! Haha."
174,13,1,Nick,"No, sir."
175,13,1,Kevin,"No, Mr. Mouse."
176,13,1,Joe,"[softly] No, Mr. Mouse."
177,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha. [heads for the door] Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha. [shuts the door behind him as he leaves. A picture of the brothers falls from the back of the door and shatters on the floor.]"
178,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yup, he's in here. [Stan and Cartman appear behind him, then they all exit frame, reappearing at the video section.]"
179,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!"
180,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!"
181,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[unusually resigned] (Look at this. More DVDs.) [shows the DVD to the guys]
182,13,1,Eric Cartman,[takes the DVD and looks at the front cover. Kenny freezes with his left hand held out] Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
183,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude."
184,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[notices that Kenny has stopped responding.] Kenny? Kenny? [snaps his fingers] Kenny? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna look at Playboy? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?"
185,13,1,Stan Marsh,"[takes the DVD from Cartman and hands it back to Kenny] You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?"
186,13,1,Kenny McCormick,"[starts responding and takes the DVD] (Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)"
187,13,1,Stan Marsh,"[takes Kyle and Cartman aside] You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him."
188,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd."
189,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[notices something on the shelf next to him] Oh my God, look at this! [grabs it and looks at it] Motherfucker!"
190,13,1,Stan Marsh,What? [he and Kyle walk up to get a better look - it's Teen Pop Magazine with Jonas Brothers on the cover]
191,13,1,Eric Cartman,"""Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! [throws the magazine to the floor]"
192,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!"
193,13,1,Stan Marsh,"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! [he and Cartman leave. Kyle stays in place a while, then walks back to Kenny, patting him on the back]"
194,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. [runs off to catch up with the other two boys. Kenny is left caressing the DVD]"
195,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah...)
196,13,1,Announcer,"(Off-Screen) Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver."
197,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys. [the girls in the audience begin to shriek. Each of the brothers holds a mic]
198,13,1,Joe,Hello.
199,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,"Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys."
200,13,1,Joe,"Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel."
201,13,1,Mickey Mouse,[in the control tent with an engineer] In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D.
202,13,1,Kevin,"Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D. [the girls shriek again]"
203,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,"Now, guys, a lot has been made about your ""purity rings"". Can you tell us about those?"
204,13,1,Joe,"Well. Um. [Joe holds up his left hand, palm in, to show off his ring. His brothers do the same seconds later] We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy."
205,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha. [the engineer responds]"
206,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,"That's wonderful, boys. [the camera zooms in on Joe's left ring finger, on which his purity ring rests] It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?"
207,13,1,Nick,Uh huh.
208,13,1,Joe,Yeah. Uh huh.
209,13,1,Kevin,Yeah.
210,13,1,Nick,Yeah.
211,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,Well can you give our audience a peek? [to the audience] What do you say girls? Do you want the Jonas Brothers to douse you with their white foam? [the girls shriek again. The brothers whip out some high-pressure hoses with bags of foam attached to them and proceed to spray the audience with streams of white foam. One of their songs plays in the background]
212,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Oh boy! This is TV gold, haha. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman enter the street and make their way through the audience]"
213,13,1,Stan Marsh,Excuse us. Excuse us.
214,13,1,Girl 2,"Hey, what do you think you're doing?!"
215,13,1,Good Mornin' Denver Host,"That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?"
216,13,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!"
217,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!"
218,13,1,Joe,Huh?
219,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
220,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[takes notice] Who the hell are these guys? [takes off his shades and tosses them aside] Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?"
221,13,1,Eric Cartman,This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by [a dart strike him in the neck and knocks him out quick] teh- ...tehhhh [falls on his face]
222,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman?
223,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha! [drops a dart into a blowpipe]"
224,13,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, who the hell did that? [a dart hits him in the neck] Hwa? [another one hits Kyle in the neck]"
225,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,D'ow... [they both fall over unconscious.]
226,13,1,Voice 1,"Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!"
227,13,1,Voice 2,Get another mic on that drum kit!
228,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha? [walks up and gets in the boy's face] Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha. [the boy is alert now] Who do you work for? DreamWorks? [cut to a wide shot revealing a disheveled Stan being held up by his hat. Nearby, Cartman and Kyle are still unconscious.] Answer me, haha!"
229,13,1,Stan Marsh,We... don't work for anybody.
230,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[lets Stan's head drop to the floor] Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha. [Cartman wakes up. Kyle stirs] You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha."
231,13,1,Eric Cartman,The hell did you do to us?!
232,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"SHUT UP! [kicks Cartman in the balls, making him sit on his ass] Haha."
233,13,1,Announcer,"And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular! [the graphic says ""the 3D Concert Experience""] Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado! [the young girl fans are there cheering and wearing 3-D glasses]"
234,13,1,Male Host,Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!
235,13,1,Female Host,"In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling ""the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia."""
236,13,1,Blonde Girl and her Da-da,"Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?"
237,13,1,Father Maxi,"Not yet, Katie."
238,13,1,Male Host,Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.
239,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[depressed] (And not getting a blowjob...)
240,13,1,Male Host,We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.
241,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"You'd better start talkin', haha! [Stan covers his face, then removes his hands] You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!"
242,13,1,Stan Marsh,We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
243,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
244,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!"
245,13,1,Joe,You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
246,13,1,Kevin,We've all angered God.
247,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[walks up to them with the chainsaw and revs it up against the boys, who cringe a bit] You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha! [throws the chainsaw aside] You three faggots are going onstage, and [points at the boys] YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody [Kyle notices he's next to the mic control desk and surreptitiously turns up the Mic 1 slider] fuck this up! [this causes Mickey's voice to be heard by the audience, who quiet down] Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?! [Cartman sees the curtain control button and presses it. The curtain rises revealing Mickey Mouse to the audience] Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha. [Mickey is facing the boys, so he doesn't notice anything happening behind him yet] They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha. [having heard his own echo, he blanches and turns around. He now sees the audience] Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks."
248,13,1,Audience,BOOO!!
249,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers."
250,13,1,Joe,Come on guys. [the brothers turn left and walk offstage and the booing continues]
251,13,1,Mickey Mouse,No! Stop! Bring them back here!
252,13,1,Roadie,"It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out."
253,13,1,Mickey Mouse,NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH! [Mickey suddenly blows up to a height of some 40 feet and starts breathing fire on the audience. The girls scatter]
254,13,1,Father Maxi,[walks up to the TV and turns it off] That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.
255,13,1,Reporter,"Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit."
256,13,1,Mickey Mouse,"[floating over the city like a Thanksgiving Day float] Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha."
257,13,1,Reporter,"The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed. [Kenny offers Tammy the Grey's Anatomy DVD, but she looks at her purity ring]"
258,13,1,Tammy Warner,"Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring."
259,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
260,13,1,Tammy Warner,"No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken."
261,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??) [throws away the DVD] (Really?)
262,13,1,Tammy Warner,Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
263,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. Screw this crap!) [as one they take off their rings and throw them to the floor and hug each other]
264,13,1,Tammy Warner,Oh I feel better already!
265,13,1,Kenny McCormick,(Me too!)
266,13,1,Tammy Warner,What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?
267,13,1,Kenny McCormick,[jumps for joy] (Woo-hoo!!) [takes her hand and runs out the door with her]
268,13,1,Father Maxi,"And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world..."
269,13,1,Eric Cartman,"[during the eulogy] I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said."
270,13,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, now we know."
271,13,1,Eric Cartman,And knowing is half the battle.
272,13,2,Liane Cartman,"[voice over] The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse. [A shot of Tele's TV store ""Closed until further notice due to BAD ECONOMY""] The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down. [a shadow runs across the screen, in a cape. Next scene: an alley looking towards the street. An Obama poster for CHANGE is shown, with WHEN? spray-painted over the word] Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things. [the shadow climbs up a pipe and runs across the roof of the building opposite the alley entrance] He didn't. [next shot is that of a street under a threatening red sky] As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection. [another alley. An aluminum trash can falls over, spilling its contents. The shadow appears on a wall, larger than life, then runs away] There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage. [A rain gutter is shown. The shadow runs across the screen again, closer to the camera] To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man. [another rooftop. The camera finds the shadow and zooms in on it.] I'm the hero this town needs. I am... [the shadow turns and is lit up. It's Cartman dressed as...] the Coon! [Cartman looks up to the sky, and graphics for ""The Coon"" pop up. Next scene, the Coon runs down a street and leaps onto the roof of a car] As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. [he leaps off the car]"
273,13,2,Josh and Lisa,Lisa I had a really great time tonight.
274,13,2,Josh and Lisa,"I did too, Josh."
275,13,2,Josh and Lisa,Would you... mind very much if I kissed you?
276,13,2,Josh and Lisa,Not at all. [they start kissing. A pair of binoculars spies them from some distance.]
277,13,2,The Coon,"[voice over. The Coon is on the roof of a public restroom house looking through the binoculars] A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon."
278,13,2,Josh and Lisa,"O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!"
279,13,2,The Coon,[leaps into action] Let her go!
280,13,2,Josh and Lisa,[points to himself] 'Scuse me?
281,13,2,The Coon,You aren't raping anyone tonight!
282,13,2,Josh and Lisa,"Oh, it's a talking squirrel. [The Coon runs at him, leaps onto the bench, and starts clawing at him] Oh!"
283,13,2,Josh and Lisa,Ah!
284,13,2,Josh and Lisa,Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!
285,13,2,The Coon,[stops clawing and says to Lisa] Get out of here! Get to safety! [Lisa gets up and runs away screaming. The Coon gets back to clawing at Josh]
286,13,2,Josh and Lisa,Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!
287,13,2,The Coon,[voice over as he leaps off the chair and runs off] Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?
288,13,2,Josh and Lisa,[gently stroking the cuts] Oh that really stings.
289,13,2,Officer 1,"Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective."
290,13,2,Sgt Yates,"Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to- [his eyes widen at something behind Murphy. It's... The Coon, perched on an open window. Murphy turns to look and does a double-take]"
291,13,2,The Coon,"Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet."
292,13,2,Sgt Yates,"Oh, not this kid again."
293,13,2,Officer 1,"Hey, you get out of here. Out."
294,13,2,The Coon,There was another rapist in the park tonight. [jumps into the station] It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and it stinks to the top.
295,13,2,Sgt Yates,What?
296,13,2,The Coon,I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.
297,13,2,Sgt Yates,"Jesus Christ, [looks at the other detectives] can we get a lock on that window? [he turns to look at the Coon] Look kid, you need to stop- [his eyes widen again. Murphy looks over his shoulder again - The Coon is gone, and the window curtains softly sway]"
298,13,2,Officer 1,He's gone.
299,13,2,The Coon,"[steps out from behind a file cabinet at the other end of the floor] No, I'm just over here now. [all the detectives turn to face him] What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?"
300,13,2,Sgt Yates,"Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!"
301,13,2,Officer 1,"Jail's full, sir."
302,13,2,Sgt Yates,"Whatever. Then we'll just put you in- [is surprised again. The other detectives are also surprised, as the Coon isn't by the file cabinet anymore.]"
303,13,2,The Coon,[appears by the window again] Now I'm back over here.
304,13,2,Sgt Yates,[walks towards the window] Just get out of here before we-! [another surprised look. The camera looks at an empty floor space]
305,13,2,The Coon,I'm right here now. [the camera moves to the right until he appears]
306,13,2,Sgt Yates,"All right, stop it!"
307,13,2,The Coon,"Yes, I have to go now. [turns to the window, reaches over and grabs a box, and carries it over to the officers] But in the meantime I have something that might interest you. [turns and walks back to the window] Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!"
308,13,2,Sgt Yates,"What's in here? [two of his officers walk over to open the box. The window is shown again and the Coon is gone. The officers open the box and pull out some shirts - ""Who is the Coon?"" and the Coon mask are on the front of the shirts]"
309,13,2,Liane Cartman,Hey guys. Good morning. [the guys don't respond to him at all] You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
310,13,2,Stan Marsh,Who's the Coon?
311,13,2,Liane Cartman,"I know, right? [enunciating] ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace."
312,13,2,Kyle Broflovski,"...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway."
313,13,2,Liane Cartman,"[stunned, turns to Kyle and points] You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!"
314,13,2,Kyle Broflovski,"...Dude, what?!"
315,13,2,Liane Cartman,He's not a fag!
316,13,2,Kyle Broflovski,Why do you care?
317,13,2,Liane Cartman,"[straightens up and moves off a bit] Oh. I uh... well I ah ah [crosses his arms] I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante? [neither of them answer him] Kenny?"
318,13,2,Liane Cartman,"And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? [he's wearing a ""Who is the Coon?"" shirt] Is he a hero or a menace? [half the class is bored, and Clyde is asleep at his desk. Mr. Garrison reads quietly at his desk] While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now- [spots the sleeper] Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important. [Clyde wakes up and looks around in a daze] What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too."
319,13,2,The Coon,"[voice over] Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city. [another little superhero walks up to the edge of roof a few feet from the Coon] And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are- [the Coon notices] Who the hell is that? [looks the new hero over a few times, then walks up to him and asks] Who the hell are you?"
320,13,2,M,"[this hero wears an M on his shirt and a ? on his hood] I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets, I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs."
321,13,2,The Coon,"Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs! [M ignores him] Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!"
322,13,2,M,Nuh uh.
323,13,2,The Coon,Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?
324,13,2,M,I am Mysterion.
325,13,2,The Coon,"Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!"
326,13,2,Mysterion,"I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know."
327,13,2,The Coon,Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.
328,13,2,Mysterion,"I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat."
329,13,2,The Coon,[thinks for a few seconds] Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!
330,13,2,Mysterion,I really don't care who you are.
331,13,2,The Coon,"Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!"
332,13,2,Mysterion,Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
333,13,2,The Coon,"No, I'm no- I [makes his voice gruff again] I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!"
334,13,2,Mysterion,I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. [leaps off the roof and out of view]
335,13,2,The Coon,"NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you! [no one replies] Motherfucker!"
336,13,2,Liane Cartman,"[voice over. He's seated alone on a merry-go-round] Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens. [shuts his eyes] No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus. [opens his eyes, keeping a look of determination on his face] Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate."
337,13,2,The Coon,"[alone in the room] How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!"
338,13,2,Airport Hilton Maitre D,"Got everything you need here, sir? Okay on beverages, buffet items?"
339,13,2,The Coon,"Yes, it's fine!"
340,13,2,Airport Hilton Maitre D,"Great. Hey, I just want to say that the Airport Hilton really appreciates your continued business."
341,13,2,The Coon,"What do you mean ""continued""? You don't know who I am!"
342,13,2,Airport Hilton Maitre D,"Aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his AIDS benefit here, before?"
343,13,2,The Coon,"No, I'm not that kid!"
344,13,2,Airport Hilton Maitre D,Oh. Oh oh really? Oh my bad. I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.
345,13,2,The Coon,[looks back at him] You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!
346,13,2,Liane Cartman,[sadly] Hunh!
347,13,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?"
348,13,2,Liane Cartman,"I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!"
349,13,2,Liane Cartman,"[puts her left hand on his right shoulder] Aww, what happened, hun?"
350,13,2,Liane Cartman,I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
351,13,2,Anchor,Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
352,13,2,Liane Cartman,"[suddenly hopeful, looks at the TV] Wha, what?"
353,13,2,Anchor,"But who exactly is... Mysterion? [a silhouette appears, but it doesn't look like the Coon's]"
354,13,2,Liane Cartman,[angrily] What?!
355,13,2,Anchor,"Curious crowds in the town of South Park, Colorado. [people mill around looking for pictures of Mysterion to take] They've brought binoculars and camera phones trying to get a shot of a mysterious superhero."
356,13,2,Man 1,"Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak."
357,13,2,Woman 1,"He jumped down from the fire escape stairs, and then he just ran off. We barely got a look at him."
358,13,2,Man 2,"To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!"
359,13,2,Crowd,"Yeah! [the man grins, showing off some gold teeth]"
360,13,2,Man 3,"Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol.that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind."
361,13,2,Liane Cartman,Fuckin' butthole!
362,13,2,Man 4,"[behind the wheel] Well if you ask me, he's a menace. There's no room for vigilantism in today's world!"
363,13,2,Reporter and News Anchors,"[showing some ""AMATEUR SKETCH"" images worthy of a graphic novel] This artist rendition of Mysterion has already generated thousands of copies."
364,13,2,Liane Cartman,You gotta be kidding me!
365,13,2,Reporter and News Anchors,"As hundreds of people to try and get a glimpse of the superhero, one question remains: Who is Mysterion? [everyone around him begins to ask the same question]"
366,13,2,Anchor,"If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline."
367,13,2,Liane Cartman,[shakes in anger] AAAAAHT!! [turns right and leaves in a huff]
368,13,2,Mysterion,"[voice over] I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime. [a shot of City Hall. Mysterion appears on the roof by the dome] I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe. [he leaps off the roof and soon climbs up a rain gutter] Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. [climbs in through a window ...into the police station.]"
369,13,2,Sgt Yates,"Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?"
370,13,2,Mysterion,There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
371,13,2,Officer 2,"We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help. [Mysterion climbs out the window and goes down the fire escape ladder. The officer walks over to the window] Godspeed, Mysterion!"
372,13,2,Sgt Yates,"You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world! [as Mysterion walks away from the police station, the Coon jumps into his path.]"
373,13,2,The Coon,"Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!"
374,13,2,Mysterion,This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
375,13,2,Mysterion,Answer the call to save her.
376,13,2,the Coon,Answer the call to save her.
377,13,2,The Coon,"That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!"
378,13,2,Mysterion,"I don't have time for this. [brings out some fireworks and lights the fuse. He drops the fireworks on the ground and leaves. They pop up and deter the Coon from following him. When the smoke clears the Coon looks around and doesn't see anyone.] Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole! [to the officers on the second floor] Hey, he's got fireworks!"
379,13,2,Liane Cartman,"So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!"
380,13,2,Stan Marsh,Not really.
381,13,2,Liane Cartman,"Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! [grabs Stan's right hand and sniffs it vigorously, then lets it go and looks around for other suspects]"
382,13,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell?"
383,13,2,Liane Cartman,"Aha! Kenny! I should have known! [walks over to Kenny's locker and points] Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?! [points at Kenny] Unless you are Mysterion!"
384,13,2,Stan Marsh,"[opens his door to demonstrate something] Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too."
385,13,2,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah, so do I."
386,13,2,Liane Cartman,What?! Why?
387,13,2,Clyde Donovan,"I don't know, it's just a cool costume."
388,13,2,Liane Cartman,"It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!"
389,13,2,Wendy Testaburger,[walking by] How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
390,13,2,Liane Cartman,[gasps and walks away a bit to watch Wendy leave] Fucking bitch...
391,13,2,The Coon,"[voice over] I had no choice. [he peeks out from behind a building, then runs] I was at the end of my rope. [he hears a sound and turns to its direction] Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society."
392,13,2,A Voice,Hahahahahahahahaaa... Look what the cat dragged in.
393,13,2,The Coon,Come out where I can see you!
394,13,2,A Voice,"What's the matter, Coon? Nervous?"
395,13,2,The Coon,"[voice over] I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need."
396,13,2,A Voice,How utterly delightful! The heroic and mighty Coon [Professor Chaos leaps into view] come to put a stop to me again.
397,13,2,The Coon,"[voice over] Chaos. I need to keep on my toes. [speaks] I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information."
398,13,2,Professor Chaos,Oh I'm sure you do. But you see I [almost trips on his cape] whoop. [recovers] But you see I also know you like to beat me up.
399,13,2,The Coon,"I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity. [the two adversaries begin to circle each other]"
400,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!"
401,13,2,The Coon,I'm not on his side!
402,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Do you think I'm a fool?! All those times you stopped me from my acts of evil! All those times you tricked me into meeting you, and then ga- and then gave me titty-twisters! Not this time, Coon! I finally learned my lesson! Now, General Disarray! [General Disarray holds a rope on the roof behind the Coon at the end of the storage building. He jumps down and swings towards the Coon and knocks him down] Yeah-ha! [General Disarray tries to keep the Coon on the ground.]"
403,13,2,The Coon,That's it! [stands up]
404,13,2,Professor Chaos,O- oh careful General Disarray.
405,13,2,The Coon,"Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!"
406,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Hehyeah! We beat him, General Disarray! [General Disarray has the Coon in a choke hold]"
407,13,2,The Coon,Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!
408,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Let him go, General Disarray! [General Disarray lets go and hops off. Professor Chaos puts his fists to his waist] Why would you help us?!"
409,13,2,The Coon,"Because Mysterion is trying to [bumps General Disarray off. General Disarray strikes a couple of trash cans and gets up a bit dazed] You fucker, that fuckin' hurt! [turns towards Professor Chaos] Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!"
410,13,2,Professor Chaos,But you both fight for justice and good.
411,13,2,The Coon,"Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!"
412,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Very well. I will show you what we know about Mysterion's identity, but if this is some kind of setup-"
413,13,2,The Coon,"N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people."
414,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Weh- oh yeah. [turns and walks away. General Disarray walks away also, and the Coon follows them]"
415,13,2,The Coon,"[voice over] I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move."
416,13,2,Mysterion,[on Kyle's bed] Hello Kyle.
417,13,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks, then jumps in his seat] Whoa, what the?"
418,13,2,Mysterion,Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
419,13,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid."
420,13,2,Mysterion,Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
421,13,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are."
422,13,2,Mysterion,"[turns away from Kyle] I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating."
423,13,2,Kyle Broflovski,Who? Me? Why?
424,13,2,Mysterion,Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. [looks over his shoulder. Kyle just stands there.]
425,13,2,Professor Chaos,This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.
426,13,2,The Coon,You guys have your own storage facility?
427,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Actually it belongs to General Disarray's grandma, um but she lets us use it. [General Disarray removes the lock from the unit and tries to lift the door. Professor Chaos helps him out and holds the door open as General Disarray and the Coon enter, then enters and lets the door drop closed behind them. Professor Chaos leads the Coon through the unit] This is where we come up with all our evil plans. Here's our computer relays. [a TV on a large stereo console with a toy keyboard attached] And this is like a, a cube of chaos that can destroy the world in one second! [an unsolved Rubik's Cube under glass, on a table from which a sign hangs: WARNING DO NOT TOUCH!] And here's some of our evil minions! [hamsters] We have everything we need here. Can I offer you a Coke or a Sprite or something?"
428,13,2,The Coon,I'll take a Sprite.
429,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Uhget the Coon a Sprite, General Disarray. [General Disarray leaves to get the Sprite while Professor Chaos takes the Coon to a wall with pictures of the other guys in class on it] As you can see we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity."
430,13,2,The Coon,"You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that ""Who Is The Coon?"" T-shirt I gave you?"
431,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity."
432,13,2,The Coon,"Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion."
433,13,2,Professor Chaos,"No, he's too fat. Based on his body type it's gotta be someone like Stan or Kyle. [The Coon turns away, insulted, but his eyes pop open as he sees who the Coon suspects are: Harvey Fierstein, Cartman, and Bruce Vilanch. It just makes him angrier]"
434,13,2,The Coon,"Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all."
435,13,2,Anchor,The clock is ticking and the citizens of South Park are gripped in fear. Two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if Mysterion [a pic of Mysterion appears] does not reveal his identity.
436,13,2,Professor Chaos,"[from his headquarters, reading a prepared statement] Mark my words, South Park! Your precious hero is now, uh, your undoing! If Mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by Wednesday night, I am going to blow up... a hospital. Blow up a hospital? [looks off to his right] I'm not gonna blow up any hospital. Are you nuts? What? [turns to the camera] Uh, the choice is yours, Mysterion! Unmask yourself or hundreds will die! Hahaha. [looks off to his right again] Jesus Christ."
437,13,2,Anchor,Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?
438,13,2,Anchor 2,[through his teeth] Where is Mysterion?
439,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?"
440,13,2,The Coon,"If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?"
441,13,2,Professor Chaos,"But you really wanna blow up a hospital? I mean, a-aren't you a good guy?"
442,13,2,The Coon,"Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos."
443,13,2,General Disarray,"[walks up to Professor Chaos] You know, I've been thinking: if we're really evil villains, then we should betray him, and blow him up with the hospital."
444,13,2,The Coon,"You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?! [turns and runs to the edge of the floor] Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff! [jumps down to the ground]"
445,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Aww jeez General Disarray, this is a lot more than I ever really intended. [General Disarray almost loses his balance twice, but recovers both times] I mean, well I hate the world and all its beauty and happiness and all but, but blowin' up a hospital? It just seems mean. [a shadow spreads across the floor before them. They look towards the shadow's source and find Mysterion standing on a beam above them. Chaos gasps] Whoa. Oh hamburgers!"
446,13,2,General Disarray,AAAGH! [runs away to the other end of the floor and behind some boxes of TNT]
447,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada..."
448,13,2,Mysterion,"Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!"
449,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Whowell I b- Well I b- ah I just would jes one nigh-, and then the Coon saw it up and I wa able to, and was able to [begins to mumble and fade out]"
450,13,2,Professor Chaos,Waaugh!
451,13,2,Man 5,What is that?
452,13,2,Man 6,Look! Mysterion and Professor Chaos are fighting!
453,13,2,Man 7,"Give him hell, Mysterion! [more people appear and begin cheering the fight. General Disarray returns to help Professor Chaos]"
454,13,2,Woman 2,Look out Mysterion! General Disarray is behind you! [General Disarray grabs onto Mysterion's left leg]
455,13,2,Officer 3,"Jesus Christ, we need backup out here! [a police car pulls up as he says this. A sniper tries to train his scope on Professor Chaos]"
456,13,2,Officer 4,"I think I can get a shot at Chaos, sir."
457,13,2,Sgt Yates,"[stays his officer's rifle] You think your bullets can hurt him? [Chaos and Disarray have defeated Mysterion, who lies unconscious on his back against some open bags of plaster. The crowd below gasps]"
458,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Yeah, we did it!"
459,13,2,Man 8,[breaking the crowd's silence] He's dead. Mysterion is dead.
460,13,2,Woman 3,Nooo... [begins to sob. Other begin to sob too]
461,13,2,Reporter and News Anchors,"The impossible has happened. Mysterion, beloved protector of the city, is dead. Who will save us now?"
462,13,2,Man 9,Wait! Look! [Mysterion begins to move and wakes up]
463,13,2,Officer 4,"He's all right! [the crowd cheers and the battle between Mysterion and Chaos resumes, with Disarray trying to restrain Mysterion. Mysterion throws him off, and Disarray runs away again]"
464,13,2,Liane Cartman,"[offscreen] Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!"
465,13,2,The Coon,[walking up a ramp to the first floor] Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day.
466,13,2,Man 1,Isn't that Bruce Vilanch?
467,13,2,Man 11,Be careful Bruce Vilanch! There are superhumans fighting right over there!
468,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!"
469,13,2,The Coon,"Don't worry, Mysterion! [Mysterion gets off Chaos and Chaos stands up] The Coon will now help you!"
470,13,2,Professor Chaos,"Well, wait! I thought we were workin' together. [the Coon punches him in the mouth] Waaa. [sprouts a bloody nose] Oh jeez, I think I broke a tooth. [covers his face, turns left and runs out of view, mumbling. The crowd cheers some more]"
471,13,2,The Coon,"That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time."
472,13,2,Mysterion,What next time?
473,13,2,The Coon,"Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask. [Mysterion gives this some thought.]"
474,13,2,Mysterion,"Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself."
475,13,2,Sgt Yates,"Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante"
476,13,2,The Coon,Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.
477,13,2,Man 12,"Don't show your face, Mysterion!"
478,13,2,Man 13,You have to be a symbol!
479,13,2,The Coon,So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!
480,13,2,Mysterion,"No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. [the camera zooms in on him as he gets ready to remove his mask. As soon as he shows his eyes and nose, the camera stops]"
481,13,2,Crowd,Ohhh.
482,13,2,Man 14,[holding a camera] Well I'll be.
483,13,2,The Coon,I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!
484,13,2,Mr Garrison,"Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion."
485,13,2,Sgt Yates,"Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail. [hands Mysterion over to Murphy, who escorts him away]"
486,13,2,The Coon,"[voice over] My entire plan worked to perfection. [holds up his right hand] My work here is done. [leaps away, then appears on the roof of a building] With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe. [runs across the roof and leaps down, holding on to the sides of a ladder. He leaps off the bottom of the ladder and plants his right hand on the ground] Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind. [he eats a burger meal at a fast food restaurant] Every town needs a hero. [walks down a street towards sunset] Every town needs... a Coon. [looks back at the camera, then turns away and resumes walking. Last scene has the Coon riding down the street on his Big Coon Wheel tricycle]"
487,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Do I really have to do this, Dad?"
488,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money."
489,13,3,Stan Marsh,But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
490,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Okay, next please."
491,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Go on, Stanley. [Stan walks up to the teller's desk and takes a seat.]"
492,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"How can I help you, young man?"
493,13,3,Stan Marsh,"I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years."
494,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone. [they look at each other for a long time]"
495,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, what?"
496,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,It's gone. It's all gone.
497,13,3,Stan Marsh,What's all gone?
498,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone."
499,13,3,Stan Marsh,What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
500,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,Not anymore you don't. POOF.
501,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Well, what can I do to get back my money-?"
502,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only."
503,13,3,Stan Marsh,I just opened an account.
504,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,Do you have any money invested in this bank?
505,13,3,Stan Marsh,"No, you just lost it all!"
506,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. [an elderly woman steps up and bumps Stan out of the chair.]
507,13,3,Stan Marsh,Hey!
508,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Hello Mrs. Farnickle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone."
509,13,3,Elderly Woman,What?
510,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please."
511,13,3,Stan Marsh,Dad!
512,13,3,Randy Marsh,Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
513,13,3,South Park Bank Teller,"Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son's-- aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only. Please step aside! [both Randy and Stan are dumbstruck.]"
514,13,3,Announcer,This is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL
515,13,3,Anchor,"An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt."
516,13,3,Mr Garrison,"[in front of a convenience store] It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished."
517,13,3,Stephen Stotch,[in front of the Stotch home] It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!
518,13,3,Butters Stotch,"[waves to the camera, but his face is blocked by the 9 News logo] Hi, Grandma!"
519,13,3,Darryl Weathers and Automotive Workers,"First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!"
520,13,3,Worker 1,They took our jobs!
521,13,3,Worker 2,[shrieking] Derk er derrrrrr!
522,13,3,Worker 3,Deeekerrdrrr
523,13,3,Worker 4,Deeerkerrrrrrdrrrr
524,13,3,Anchor,"Just how far will the economy fall? We asked economic reporter Dan Banks for his assessment. [a shot of Dan, who raises a gun to his head and fires, shooting his brains out and falling out of view.] We'll have the rest of Dan's interview tonight at 10."
525,13,3,Sharon Marsh,"All right everyone, eat up. [takes her seat]"
526,13,3,Randy Marsh,Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
527,13,3,Sharon Marsh,You said we had to be careful with our money. I've got nothing for a food budget.
528,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?"
529,13,3,Randy Marsh,"[grabs a hot dog from the platter] I'll tell you what happened, son. See, there's a bunch of idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had. [slaps the hot dog onto his own plate] They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need-- [grabs his margarita glass and rises from the table] people with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying. [walks over to a Margaritaville margarita blender and loads it with ice. A margarita mix is already in place in the blender] And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing, [puts the ice scooper back into the ice bucket] 'cause they thought money was endless! [starts up the blender, which drowns out whatever he says for the next nine seconds] It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans, [the blender stops] meaning less money coming in. [serves himself a margarita and places the blender back on its base] And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry. [goes back to his seat with his margarita] We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? [sips from his margarita glass]"
530,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I think I get it."
531,13,3,Orator 1,And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy fall... As the people we must...
532,13,3,Orator 2,...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...
533,13,3,Eric Cartman,"And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft..."
534,13,3,Randy Marsh,"[dressed in a drab green toga] There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you! [starts pointing at random people] YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand dollar house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers! [speeds up his rate of pointing] Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!"
535,13,3,Man 1,He's right.
536,13,3,Man 2,This is the first guy to actually make sense. [more people are attracted to Randy's preaching]
537,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. [everyone applauds softly]"
538,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,"Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?"
539,13,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought."
540,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,"Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh. [Stan tries to put the receipt onto the counter, but the large Margaritaville gets in the way. Stan then just reaches up and the clerk takes the receipt] Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh."
541,13,3,Stan Marsh,What?
542,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,"I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?"
543,13,3,Stan Marsh,So?
544,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
545,13,3,Stan Marsh,Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
546,13,3,Sur la Table Clerk,"[rests his head on his left hand] Hm... that's improbahbluh, [raises his left hand] but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. [Stan just looks at him]"
547,13,3,Randy Marsh,"We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head! [a shot of the Stotches in togas] Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!"
548,13,3,Gerald Broflovski,"What can we do, Randy?"
549,13,3,Man 3,Yes tell us.
550,13,3,Man 4,Tell us.
551,13,3,Man 5,Tell us what to do.
552,13,3,Man 6,"Tell us, Randy, what we should do!"
553,13,3,Man 7,"What should we do, Randy?!"
554,13,3,Randy Marsh,"We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending! [everyone begins to cheer] The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. [stretches out his arms as the audience cheers him on.]"
555,13,3,Al and Ted,[on a llama] Mornin' Ted.
556,13,3,Al and Ted,[shoveling snow off his walkway] Mornin' Al.
557,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,Well this sucks!
558,13,3,Clyde Donovan,Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
559,13,3,Eric Cartman,"[arrives and sighs] Hengh! [the squirrels run off] Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS! [stomps his left foot down] Hengh!"
560,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You want something new every week, fatass."
561,13,3,Eric Cartman,"[leaps towards him] Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!"
562,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,My fault?
563,13,3,Eric Cartman,"The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!"
564,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[jumps off his rocky perch and faces Cartman] Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!"
565,13,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, [Kyle looks back at him] why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?"
566,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?"
567,13,3,Butters Stotch,Well Eric did. [Kyle glares at Cartman again]
568,13,3,Eric Cartman,"Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle."
569,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it. [the other boys now pay attention to Kyle. Two men watch Kyle from afar.] What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family"
570,13,3,Man 8,"We best speak with the Council, and tell them.. a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy."
571,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,Can I help you?
572,13,3,Stan Marsh,I wanna return this Margaritaville.
573,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"O-kay, let me send you into Josh. [next shot is of Josh dipping his finger into a little can of Carmex and spreading it on his lips]"
574,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?"
575,13,3,Stan Marsh,"No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it."
576,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah."
577,13,3,Stan Marsh,What?
578,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm."
579,13,3,Stan Marsh,Wall Street?
580,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah."
581,13,3,Stan Marsh,So?
582,13,3,Receptionist and her boss Josh,"Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... [Stan sighs in frustration]"
583,13,3,Stephen Stotch,"The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills."
584,13,3,Father Maxi,"You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword."
585,13,3,Randy Marsh,"I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan."
586,13,3,Skeeter,"We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online."
587,13,3,Randy Marsh,Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
588,13,3,Man 9,"Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!"
589,13,3,Randy Marsh,What?!
590,13,3,Man 9,He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!
591,13,3,Father Maxi,Spend more?! What mockery is this?!
592,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?"
593,13,3,Eric Cartman,"I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. [begins to sob, and a rowdy crowd approaches from the right]"
594,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What's that? [a crowd of men runs past them, snatching up squirrels on the way]"
595,13,3,Man 1,"'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels."
596,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,What? [the boys stand and follow the men]
597,13,3,Mr Garrison,"Now please, please! [holds his arms up in self-defense]"
598,13,3,Man 1,You have sinned!
599,13,3,Mr Garrison,"Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please."
600,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,What's going on?
601,13,3,Man 1,"Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!"
602,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,What did he do?
603,13,3,Man 11,Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!
604,13,3,Man 1,"Take that punishment, heathen! [the crowd begins stoning Garrison with squirrels]"
605,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps in between Garrison and the crowd] Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!"
606,13,3,Man 1,"Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer."
607,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, this is ridiculous!"
608,13,3,Man 1,What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!
609,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. [a man behind Principal Victoria moves and hucks a squirrel at Garrison]"
610,13,3,Mr Garrison,Oh. [the crowd gets rowdy again]
611,13,3,Stan Marsh,"'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?"
612,13,3,Stockbroker,Margaritaville?
613,13,3,Stan Marsh,My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
614,13,3,Stockbroker,"Oh, that makes sense."
615,13,3,Stan Marsh,It does?
616,13,3,Stockbroker,"You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks."
617,13,3,Stan Marsh,So I can return it to a bank?
618,13,3,Stockbroker,"Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritavilles assets from the banks."
619,13,3,Stan Marsh,What?!
620,13,3,Stockbroker,"Just talk to the Treasury Department in DC. They're the ones who really understand how all this works. [notices some activity on his stocks] Oh, sell sell sell sell sell sell sell!"
621,13,3,Stan Marsh,Aargh! [walks off with the Margaritaville]
622,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them. [pulls out an envelope] I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card. [from Kyle's position, one can see hundreds of people listening to him] It has no spending limit. [cries of shock rise from the crowd] Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money."
623,13,3,Man 11,"By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!"
624,13,3,Randy Marsh,"We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?"
625,13,3,Stephen Stotch,"Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us."
626,13,3,Father Maxi,"Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!"
627,13,3,Randy Marsh,"That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!"
628,13,3,Man 12,"Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew."
629,13,3,Father Maxi,"Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew."
630,13,3,Skeeter,I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. [a screeching sound is heard. A hand is seen going down a blackboard. and it belongs to Cartman]
631,13,3,Eric Cartman,"Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS."
632,13,3,Treasurer 1,"Uhh, how can we help you, young man?"
633,13,3,Stan Marsh,I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
634,13,3,Treasurer 1,Ohhh that makes sense.
635,13,3,Stan Marsh,Nnnaaargh!
636,13,3,Treasurer 1,No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.
637,13,3,Stan Marsh,[surprised] Really? [puts his hands together] Thank you.
638,13,3,Treasurer 1,"Be right back. [they go into a room through the heavy double doors behind them and close the doors. A squawk is heard, then a cleaver and the sound of blood spurting out. Stan is startled. The men come back out through the doors with streaks of blood on them.]"
639,13,3,Treasurer 2,"Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars."
640,13,3,Stan Marsh,What?!
641,13,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out."
642,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
643,13,3,Butters Stotch,Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
644,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. [the other boys gasp and look at Kyle. Tweek and Ike look at Clyde]"
645,13,3,Eric Cartman,"[stands up in his seat] All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool! [checks for a reaction] That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick! [clears his throat and sits down] Go ahead, Kyle."
646,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Cartman for a few seconds, then enunciates] Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith."
647,13,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic."
648,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. [looks down at his plate]"
649,13,3,Stan Marsh,Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
650,13,3,Treasurer 1,"What, you think it's worth more?"
651,13,3,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, that doesn't make sense!"
652,13,3,Treasurer 2,"Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth."
653,13,3,Treasurer 3,"[runs up to the other two treasurers] Uh oh, problem! Problem again!"
654,13,3,Treasurer 2,What is it now?
655,13,3,Treasurer 3,"Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!"
656,13,3,Treasurer 1,"Okay, no problem. [the three go behind the double doors again] We'd better consult the chart. [this time one of the doors is left ajar. Stan observes this and then takes the Margaritaville into the chart's room]"
657,13,3,Treasurer 3,"Sirs, another insurance company is going under!"
658,13,3,Sir 1,"Now determining most prudent move for insurance company. [brings down the gavel. Treasurer 2 picks up a chicken and a meat cleaver, puts the chicken down against the edge of the chart, and chops its head off with the meat cleaver. He then drops it into the chart and it stumbles around while Treasurer 3 plays the kazoo. The headless chicken drops onto the bailout button and the button lights up and sets off a bell]"
659,13,3,Treasurer 1,Bailout!
660,13,3,Treasurer 3,Most prudent move is a bailout!
661,13,3,Sir 1,"Bail out the insurance company! [Stan is upset at this method of resolving a serious economic problem. He picks up the Margaritaville, smashes it into the chart, turns around and leaves]"
662,13,3,Man 13,It's a miracle.
663,13,3,Man 14,Why would someone do this? [members of the economic recovery council run up to see what the commotion is about]
664,13,3,Randy Marsh,What is this? What's going on?
665,13,3,Stephen Stotch,There! Look! [a shot of Kyle signing papers] It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.
666,13,3,Randy Marsh,What's he doing?
667,13,3,Stephen Stotch,"He's... paying for everyone's debts. [a shot of several lines of people walking up to Kyle, who takes each bill, enters the amount due into a card reader, and swipes his card through the reader to pay the debt]"
668,13,3,Darryl Weathers and Automotive Workers,"Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you."
669,13,3,Randy Marsh,But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
670,13,3,Man 15,So that people will have money to spend.
671,13,3,Sheila Broflovski,"[runs up to Kyle] Kyle! [gets on her knees] Kyle, you have to stop this! [begins to cry]"
672,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"It's okay, Ma."
673,13,3,Sheila Broflovski,"No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life! [stands up and walks away] Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! [Randy gets an idea, points towards his house, and leaves. More people walk towards Kyle, and this continues for hours. Kyle begins to moan from lack of energy as he continues paying off debts]"
674,13,3,Randy Marsh,[returns with his unpaid bills] Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
675,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[pays it off, with difficulty.] Heunh. [Randy smiles and walks away]"
676,13,3,Man 16,He paid for our debts so we could spend once more. [Kyle has stopped moving. A man steps up to check]
677,13,3,Man 17,He's dead.
678,13,3,Dr Doctor,"[steps up to check Kyle's pulse] No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed. [several men raise Kyle over their heads and gently carry him home. Sheila sobs and follows them. They all go through the living room, up the stairs, into Kyle's room, and lay him down. Sheila waits as the men leave, then leaves and closes the door so Kyle can recover in peace. Beams of light enter through the window]"
679,13,3,Anchor,"For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn. [a shot of a bustling mall] Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases. [The Marshes are shopping, and Randy notices something]"
680,13,3,Randy Marsh,"Wow, the new Margaritaville! [holds it up] With salsa dispenser! ""Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom."" Oh, we need this! [Sharon buries her face in her left hand]"
681,13,3,Anchor,Are we out of the woods yet? Only time will tell. But we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again. The person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice. [the person is shown] Barack Obama. [a shot of Obama addressing a cheering crowd]
682,13,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[on the sofa watching the TV] Aww, come on!"
683,13,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh man, I thought that day would never end."
684,13,4,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?"
685,13,4,Stan Marsh,"What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!"
686,13,4,Wendy Testaburger,What day?
687,13,4,Butters Stotch,The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
688,13,4,Clyde Donovan,They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
689,13,4,Red,"Oh God, that show is so dumb."
690,13,4,Eric Cartman,Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
691,13,4,Tweek Tweak,Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
692,13,4,Bebe Stevens,Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
693,13,4,Eric Cartman,"No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. [walks from his locker to the middle of the hall, turns around, farts, and walks back to his locker. A little girl walks into the fart fumes and all the boys laugh]"
694,13,4,Little Girl,Eww! [Butters points at her and laughs cruelly]
695,13,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on guys, we gotta go! [leads the boys down the hall]"
696,13,4,Jimmy Valmer,We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
697,13,4,Eric Cartman,Let's get to my house!! [the boys run out of school chattering away while the girls remain in the hall annoyed]
698,13,4,Wendy Testaburger,God they're so stupid!
699,13,4,Stan Marsh,Oh boy!
700,13,4,Butters Stotch,This is gonna be great!
701,13,4,Craig Tucker,I've been waiting for this all week.
702,13,4,Butters Stotch,Oh boy!
703,13,4,Eric Cartman,"[walks in with some snacks for himself and spots Craig on the sofa] Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig."
704,13,4,Craig Tucker,"Dude, I was here first."
705,13,4,Eric Cartman,"It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! [Craig moves to an empty spot on the floor as Cartman takes his place on the sofa]"
706,13,4,Butters Stotch,"Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!"
707,13,4,Announcer,"You are watching the Canada Channel, the only channel in Canada."
708,13,4,Announcer 2,"Previously on Terrance & Phillip: Terrance farted on the American president, but Phillip took the heat. [A shot of Terrance farting on Barack Obama, who appears Canadian onscreen. The boys have a good laugh]"
709,13,4,Phillip,[pleading his innocence as a prison guard shoves him into a cell] It wasn't me! [fart. The boys laugh again]
710,13,4,Announcer 2,"And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Terrance & Phillip: Blood Rage [""Part 2"" appears, followed by ""Special Presentation""]"
711,13,4,Announcer,"...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this Queef Sisters Special!"
712,13,4,Eric Cartman,What?
713,13,4,Announcer 3,The Canada Channel presents... The Queef Sisters. Katherine and Katie Queef. [a shot of them at the beach farting pink queefs] Two Toronto girls who love shooting air out their vaginas. [a shot of them queefing on a unicorn.] It's The Queef Sisters special on Channel Canada.
714,13,4,Doctor,"Alright Queef Sisters, it's time for your yearly PAP smear and vag exam."
715,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Alright Doctor.
716,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","I'm ready, Doctor."
717,13,4,Doctor,[walks over to Katherine] Now I'm just going to check for cysts. [lowers his face and moves in closer for a good look... QUEEF!] Awww! [backs up and hides his face. Katherine begins to laugh. Katie joins in]
718,13,4,Eric Cartman,What the fuck is this?!
719,13,4,Doctor,"Now listen heauh! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!"
720,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina."
721,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Huhuhuhu!
722,13,4,Doctor,"Well just don't let it happen again! Now I'm going to check for cysts. [lowers his head, quickly glances at Katherine, then lowers his head again. QUEEF! The doctor recoils again] Arh! [Katherine laughs, then Katie joins in. The boys watch this special and aren't moved.] Now stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there! [goes back between Katherine's legs. QUEEF! The doctor hides his face again and the sisters laugh. The doctor is fed up and throws his notepad away] That's it! No PAP smear for you!"
723,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","But doctor, what if I have cancer?"
724,13,4,Doctor,"You should have thought of that before you queefed in my face three times! [A shot of the boys confused, with Cartman getting mad]"
725,13,4,Butters Stotch,"They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?"
726,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Doctor, my sister is just being difficult. Maybe you can just examine my cervix instead."
727,13,4,Doctor,"Well alright, let me check for cysts. [goes over to Katie and lowers his head. QUEEF! He backs out] Nooo! [the sisters laugh] That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore! [walks out the door]"
728,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry."
729,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",I guess so Katherine.
730,13,4,Eric Cartman,Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
731,13,4,Phillip,What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
732,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Queef Sisters?!
733,13,4,Network President,That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.
734,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
735,13,4,Phillip,That's sick!
736,13,4,Network President,You think farts are funny; why not queefs?
737,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Because babies come from there!
738,13,4,Network President,"Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!"
739,13,4,Eric Cartman,"No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!"
740,13,4,Wendy Testaburger,[walks up to Stan] What's going on?
741,13,4,Stan Marsh,We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
742,13,4,Eric Cartman,"You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!"
743,13,4,Clyde Donovan,I threw up on my way home.
744,13,4,Eric Cartman,Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! [more girls begin to appear]
745,13,4,Stan Marsh,"You tell 'em, Cartman!"
746,13,4,Red,What happened?
747,13,4,Butters Stotch,They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip! [crosses his arms] They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
748,13,4,Kyle Broflovski,It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
749,13,4,Bebe Stevens,Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
750,13,4,Eric Cartman,You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! [the girls have heard enough and leave]
751,13,4,Bebe Stevens,I can't believe they're this upset.
752,13,4,Red,"God, they're annoying!"
753,13,4,Annie Faulk,I don't even know what a queef is.
754,13,4,Wendy Testaburger,"It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie."
755,13,4,Annie Faulk,Oh.
756,13,4,Red,"You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants."
757,13,4,Bebe Stevens,Really?
758,13,4,Wendy Testaburger,Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
759,13,4,Eric Cartman,"And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly..."
760,13,4,Kyle Broflovski,Robbed us of our innocence.
761,13,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes, that's good."
762,13,4,Butters Stotch,[writing left-handed] Robbed us of our innocence... [the girls return]
763,13,4,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you."
764,13,4,Stan Marsh,"What? [a girl moves to the front of the group, and lets loose a queef into Butters' face. Butters is stunned and tries to get the queef off his face as if it were skunk musk]"
765,13,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh God, oh my God no! [runs down the hall and out the front doors of the school, still screaming and trying to get the queef off, then runs all the way home. He runs in, leaving the front door open and his father puzzled. He runs upstairs and into his room, slamming the door shut.]"
766,13,4,Stephen Stotch,Butters?
767,13,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye. [hangs up the cordless phone] We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. [starts to go upstairs]"
768,13,4,Sharon Marsh,Why? What happened?
769,13,4,Randy Marsh,"[backs down a couple of steps] A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. [goes on upstairs. She looks on for a few seconds]"
770,13,4,Sharon Marsh,...So?
771,13,4,Randy Marsh,Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
772,13,4,Stan Marsh,"Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming."
773,13,4,Randy Marsh,"I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody."
774,13,4,Stan Marsh,"It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?"
775,13,4,Randy Marsh,"Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again."
776,13,4,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face. [immediately people begin whispering to each other]"
777,13,4,Gerald Broflovski,How did this happen?
778,13,4,Stuart McCormick,Where were the teachers?!
779,13,4,Mrs Testaburger,"Whoa, whoa whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?"
780,13,4,Man,Just?!
781,13,4,Thomas Tucker,We're here to find out why?!
782,13,4,Randy Marsh,"The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! [more murmuring ensues]"
783,13,4,Principal Victoria,"Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. [the men look at each other]"
784,13,4,Randy Marsh,What does that have to do with anything? [the women begin to murmur in reaction to that question]
785,13,4,Regis & Kelly,Our next guests have really taken America by storm. Their hit show is being tuned in by women all over the world. Please welcome the Queef Sisters! [Regis and Kelly stand up to greet the sisters as the sisters go onstage]
786,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Oh hello Regis.
787,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Hello Kelly. [QUEEF. The sisters laugh]
788,13,4,Regis & Kelly,"So, uh, gals, ...you seem to really like queefing."
789,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it? [rips out a new queef and laughs. The audience applauds and cheers]"
790,13,4,Regis & Kelly,"But I mean really, isn't queefing a bit juvenile?"
791,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Men enjoy farts, so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?"
792,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","That's right. We've written all about it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef."
793,13,4,Regis & Kelly,Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. [lets loose a most robust queef]
794,13,4,Regis & Kelly,D'ohhh! [walks offstage covering his nose as the sisters laugh.]
795,13,4,Network President,"Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired."
796,13,4,Terrance Phillip,Fired?!
797,13,4,Network President,"Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on. [grabs some gift-wrapped boxes from under his desk and carries them to Terrance & Phillip.] Queef Sisters' ratings are through the roof, and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you. Goodbye. Here's some cookies. [hands them the boxes]"
798,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Brian, don't do this!"
799,13,4,Phillip,You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
800,13,4,Brian (Programming head),"[prepares himself a drink and walks by his window] Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef. [turns around and glares at the duo] But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!"
801,13,4,Martha Stewart,"I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately. [holds up some scissors and construction paper, and the camera pulls back to reveal her genitalia] It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this... [snips away] and cut out little stars and little moon shapes, [puts those stars and moons into her vagina] and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just... [puts the sparkles into the vagina as well] shoot... right up the ol'... there we are.. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip. [she queefs and the stars, moons, and sparkles pop out in a fireworks display. She grins] See how pretty that was? It's a good thing."
802,13,4,Randy Marsh,What was that?
803,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, excuse me, I... [stifles a giggle] I, I had a little air trapped. [Shelly begins to giggle]"
804,13,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?"
805,13,4,Sharon Marsh,[chuckles] Pardon me. [Shelly giggles]
806,13,4,Stan Marsh,"Mom, gross! [Sharon and Shelly giggle some more]"
807,13,4,Randy Marsh,"Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?"
808,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"[giggles and pats her face down with a napkin] Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you."
809,13,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!"
810,13,4,Stan Marsh,"Stop it, Mom!"
811,13,4,Randy Marsh,"Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?"
812,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"[giggling] Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [smiles. The family resumes eating quietly until another queef is heard. Sharon and Shelly crack up while Stan and Randy stare at them]"
813,13,4,Randy Marsh,Sharon! Marsh!
814,13,4,Sharon Marsh,Ex-cuse me.
815,13,4,Shelly Marsh,"Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. [Sharon and Shelly giggle some more]"
816,13,4,Randy Marsh,"That's it, I'm leaving! [leaves the table and heads for the front door]"
817,13,4,Stan Marsh,I'm going too. [follows Randy]
818,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!"
819,13,4,Randy Marsh,That's completely different!
820,13,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah it's different, Mom!"
821,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted."
822,13,4,Randy Marsh,"[giggles a bit] Heh, yeah?"
823,13,4,Sharon Marsh,But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
824,13,4,Randy Marsh,[giggles with Stan] Yeah?
825,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. [Randy and Stan glare at her]"
826,13,4,Randy Marsh,"Come on Stanley, let's go. [they turn and head out the front door]"
827,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!"
828,13,4,Randy Marsh,"It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! [exits the house and slams the door shut]"
829,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Look Katherine, I made queef cookies!"
830,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","But those are just ginger snaps, Katie. [Katie queefs on the cookies and voila! The sisters laugh. The doorbell rings] Could you get that, Katie? [queefs on Katie as Katie walks by to get the front door. They giggle. Katherine opens the door and sees Terrance & Phillip staring at her angrily, with their arms crossed over their chests]"
831,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Oh my God! Look, Katherine! It's Canadian television stars Terrance & Phillip!"
832,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","[jumps to her feet] Oh my God, they're famous! [walks up besides Katie] Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy. [queefs twice. The sisters laugh]"
833,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",[queefs] Wooo.
834,13,4,Phillip,"May we come in, please?"
835,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess. [Terrance & Phillip walk in and look around]"
836,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
837,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Oho yes, the show is going aboat as well as it could. [queefs]"
838,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!"
839,13,4,Phillip,"That's right! We've come to kill you! [Terrance pulls out a gun and aims it at them, and they gasp]"
840,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Why kill us? We love you.
841,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
842,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols."
843,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Your idols?
844,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand. [the sisters shut their eyes and wait to be shot]
845,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","[turns around] I don't think I can do it, Phillip. [Katie opens her eyes]"
846,13,4,Phillip,Why not? [Katherine opens her eyes]
847,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
848,13,4,Phillip,"What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. [they look over their shoulders at the sisters]"
849,13,4,Butters Stotch,Ohhhhh ohhhhh. [Cartman enters leading the other boys in class. He's carrying a box]
850,13,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?"
851,13,4,Butters Stotch,Oh. Hey fellas.
852,13,4,Eric Cartman,"We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on."
853,13,4,Butters Stotch,Aw thanks.
854,13,4,Stan Marsh,"Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny."
855,13,4,Butters Stotch,Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
856,13,4,Kyle Broflovski,Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
857,13,4,Butters Stotch,"My, my picture?"
858,13,4,Eric Cartman,"You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes."
859,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",AAH! [the sisters laugh. The foursome then stops at Canadian Red Wine Winery. Inside they sample more wine and a flatulent sound is heard]
860,13,4,Phillip,"Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!"
861,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","No, that was me, Phillip. I farted."
862,13,4,Phillip,Oh. [Both men laugh. The foursome leave and get back on the road. Terrance is still driving. They're all drinking straight from bottles]
863,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip. [Terrance brakes angrily]"
864,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Phillip?! I'm Terrance!
865,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",What? I thought you were Terrance.
866,13,4,Phillip,"No, I'm Phillip!"
867,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Oh dear. [they continue down the road, sipping from bottles. Phillip is now driving with Katherine up front while Terrance sits in back with Katie. Katie tosses her bottle back onto the road and starts making out with Terrance.]"
868,13,4,Stephen Stotch,"A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil."
869,13,4,Eric Cartman,"Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you [points to the poster] it's not a joke."
870,13,4,Stan Marsh,On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
871,13,4,Randy Marsh,"[walks into view with a mic] I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a squeaking fart, then speaks into the mic again] And then there's The Foghorn [moves the mic to his ass and lets out two farts that sound like a foghorn, then speaks into the mic again] and the ""Don't be scared"" [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a series of farts that sort of sound like ""Don't be scared"", then speaks into the mic again] and of course there's the-"
872,13,4,Woman,"Excuse me. [another woman hands her a mic] Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too."
873,13,4,Other Women,That's right! We do.
874,13,4,Woman,"For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn. [moves the mic to her vagina and makes it sneeze, then speaks into the mic again] and The Resuscitator [moves the mic to her vagina and makes a sound like an air pump]"
875,13,4,Eric Cartman,"Sick! Stop it, lady!"
876,13,4,Randy Marsh,Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a sputtering fart that sounds like a Chinese firecracker]
877,13,4,Woman 2,"That's all well and good, but we can do the Road Warrior. [moves the mic to her vagina and...]"
878,13,4,Road Warrior Queef,"Nooo! We go iiin! We kiiill! No more talk! We kiiill! Soon, my dog of war, but we have to do it my way. [switches to another voice] Losers! Losers wait!"
879,13,4,Males,[covering their noses] AWWW!
880,13,4,Randy Marsh,Jesus Christ!
881,13,4,Phillip,"You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! [evades another vase, which shatters against another wall]"
882,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig! [flings a third vase at him]"
883,13,4,Phillip,Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
884,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me! [a light turns on. Terrance and Katie are in a bed next to them]"
885,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
886,13,4,Phillip,"She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!"
887,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",SICK!
888,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Well what's the big deal? I've been queefing in this bed the entire time.
889,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",What?! Gross! [punches her on the face with his left fist]
890,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",How dare you?! [punches him back]
891,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Get out! Get out both of you! [begins pushing Phillip towards the door] We never want to see you again! [kicks his ass. Soon, both men are out of the bedroom]"
892,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","After everything we've been through? [Katie gives them the last push, shuts the door, and sobs. Katherine joins her, they hug each other, and they queef separately]"
893,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","[sighs] What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes."
894,13,4,Phillip,"Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her."
895,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong."
896,13,4,Phillip,"Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you."
897,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie",Oh Terrance. [they hug]
898,13,4,"Terrance & Phillip, Katherine & Katie","Phillip! [they hug and move towards Katherine's bed. Each couple starts fucking immediately, with the men on top]"
899,13,4,Randy Marsh,"[gasps] Oh my God! [the headline reads ""QUEEFING BANNED! ROAD WARRIOR QUEEF SEALS IT!""] Ohmygod! Stan! [turns around and closes the door, then runs to the foot of the stairs] Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!"
900,13,4,Stan Marsh,[coming down the stairs] No way! We did it?! [twirls around] Yeah!!
901,13,4,Randy Marsh,Alright son! Yeah!!
902,13,4,Sharon Marsh,[coming in from the kitchen with Shelly] What's going on?
903,13,4,Randy Marsh,"[thrusts the paper in Sharon's face] HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!"
904,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"[resigned] Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job."
905,13,4,Randy Marsh,Aw come on. [tries to lighten the mood] Just because you can't queef anymore...
906,13,4,Sharon Marsh,"You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys. [begins to sob] For getting your way... again. [she and Shelly turn around and head back to the kitchen]"
907,13,4,Stan Marsh,"Mom, we didn't mean... [he and Randy are stunned. Randy walks to the sofa and sits down.]"
908,13,4,Randy Marsh,"[exhales] Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. [Stan follows him to the sofa and sits next to him]"
909,13,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
910,13,4,Randy Marsh,"Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right."
911,13,4,Randy Marsh,There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
912,13,4,Randy Marsh,And realize we've been keeping women down.
913,13,4,Stan Marsh,And realize we've been keeping women down.
914,13,4,Mr Mackey,They have power and they have courage.
915,13,4,Stephen Stotch,"And we must all stand by the belief,"
916,13,4,Butters Stotch,"And we must all stand by the belief,"
917,13,4,Gerald Broflovski,"That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef."
918,13,4,Kyle Broflovski,"That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef."
919,13,4,The Males,Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that you’re proud.
920,13,4,Randy Marsh,You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
921,13,4,The Males,"You are woman now, and you are free to queef."
922,13,4,Eric Cartman,It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
923,13,4,Mr Garrison,They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
924,13,4,The Males Randy,"Queef free (Queef free). Every woman has the right; queef free (Queef free). Let your queefing stars shine bright.You are woman, hear you roar (queef free), queefing too loud to ignore. Queef a little each day and let your soul take flight!
Ah-aaaaaaah-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, queef free."
925,13,4,Bishop,"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. [Katherine jumps up and queefs on him] Nooo! [the sisters laugh]"
926,13,4,Phillip,"Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!"
927,13,4,Bishop,Therefore what God has joined together let no man- [Terrance jumps up and farts on him. Phillip laughs. Katie jumps up and queefs on Terrance]
928,13,4,Phillip,Aww. sick! [Terrance jumps up and farts on Katie. Phillip laughs. Katherine comes up and queefs on him. He farts on the bishop]
929,13,4,Bishop,"That's it! I now pronounce you farts and queefs! [the couples laugh as the bishop quickly leaves, Canadians laugh]"
930,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? [closes the door and walks up to Jimmy]"
931,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy [chokes up] ...rou-routine."
932,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you."
933,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week."
934,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[heads to the sofa and lays down on his back] Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together."
935,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry."
936,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[while munching] No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else."
937,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
938,13,5,Eric Cartman,"No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. [Jimmy sighs and throws away a sheet of jokes. Hours later there are many more sheets on the floor]"
939,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"...So the Pope says, ""What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"""
940,13,5,Eric Cartman,Meh. [Jimmy tosses away another crumpled sheet]
941,13,5,Sarah Valmer,"Here's some fruit, boys. [sets the plate down by Jimmy] Better for you than potato chips. Oh Jimmy, look out, there's a black widow! [pulls out a newspaper from under Jimmy's desk and smashes the spider with it]"
942,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, thanks Mom. [she turns and walks away] You might have saved my life."
943,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?"
944,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. [gets an idea, indicated by a small bell]"
945,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I like fishsticks."
946,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks. [now he writes the joke excitedly] Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? [Cartman looks at him, then sits up]"
947,13,5,Eric Cartman,"What, dude, you got something?"
948,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?"
949,13,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
950,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
951,13,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
952,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?"
953,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[thinks through the joke] Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys."
954,13,5,Butters Stotch,"Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde."
955,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde."
956,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde."
957,13,5,Clyde Donovan,Hey.
958,13,5,Stan Marsh,[walks up to the other guys] What's going on?
959,13,5,Butters Stotch,Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
960,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?"
961,13,5,Clyde Donovan,Yes. [Butters covers his mouth to stifle a laugh]
962,13,5,Eric Cartman,Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
963,13,5,Clyde Donovan,Yes. [Butters covers his mouth to stifle a laugh]
964,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[points to Clyde with both index fingers] What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?"
965,13,5,Butters Stotch,"[runs up to Cartman and Clyde] HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! [Cartman laughs. Butters soon joins him. Clyde just smiles sheepishly, knowing that's a good joke. Token walks into view and Cartman runs to him. Clyde grins]"
966,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Token, Token, got a question for you: [clears his throat] Token, do you like fishsticks?"
967,13,5,Token Black,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. [Butters begins to giggle]"
968,13,5,Eric Cartman,[motions to Butters to keep quiet for now] Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters. [back to Token] You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
969,13,5,Token Black,Yes.
970,13,5,Eric Cartman,What are you?
971,13,5,Butters Stotch,"A gay fish? [Cartman laughs first, then Butters]"
972,13,5,Eric Cartman,"A gay fish? [Cartman laughs first, then Butters]"
973,13,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley! [runs towards the unseen voice] Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? [A hot new joke is born.]"
974,13,5,Mr Garrison,"Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?"
975,13,5,Mr Mackey,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?"
976,13,5,Stephen Stotch,"Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see."
977,13,5,Peterson,"Yeah, I like fishsticks."
978,13,5,Stephen Stotch,"What are you, Peterson? A gay fish? [everyone laughs]"
979,13,5,Announcer,"And now, here he is! Jimmy Kimmel! [the studio audience cheers as he goes onstage]"
980,13,5,Jimmy Kimmel,"Alright, hey, how are we all feelin' tonight? [the audience quiets down] So uhhh, let me ask the guys in the audience a question. Do you like fishsticks?"
981,13,5,The Guys,Yes.
982,13,5,Jimmy Kimmel,"Huh. What are you, gay fish? [everyone laughs]"
983,13,5,David Letterman and Paul Shaffer,"And so uhhh, hay Paul, do you like fishsticks, Paul?"
984,13,5,David Letterman and Paul Shaffer,"Uhhh, sure?"
985,13,5,David Letterman and Paul Shaffer,"What are you, Paul, a gay fish? [everyone cracks up over it. Someone in the audience keels over the balcony. Letterman tosses away his notes]"
986,13,5,Jay Leno,"So apparently more and more Americans are eating fishsticks. Have you seen this? Have you read about this? Loving fishsticks, kinda makes me wonder, you know? What is everybody, a gay fish? [the studio audience roars with laughter and two men in the front row fall off their chairs and throw up.]"
987,13,5,Tom Snyder,"It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him."
988,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!"
989,13,5,Tom Snyder,You. Really. Don't. Get it.
990,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!"
991,13,5,Tom Snyder,You're a rapper.
992,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Yes.
993,13,5,Tom Snyder,An entrepreneur.
994,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Yes.
995,13,5,Tom Snyder,And you like fishsdicks.
996,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Yes.
997,13,5,Tom Snyder,You're a gay fish.
998,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,No! I am not no gay fish!
999,13,5,Tom Snyder,Just gay?
1000,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man!
1001,13,5,Tom Snyder,[this time goes through joke one step at a time] You are male?
1002,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Damn right I'm male.
1003,13,5,Tom Snyder,A male that like fish dicks.
1004,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Yeah, I like fishsticks"
1005,13,5,Tom Snyder,You like to put fish dicks in your mouth.
1006,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Yeah.
1007,13,5,Tom Snyder,You're a gay fish.
1008,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! [stands up pushes him off his chair]"
1009,13,5,Eric Cartman,"And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television."
1010,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"We know, Cartman!"
1011,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke."
1012,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,P-patent?
1013,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated."
1014,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh."
1015,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! [smiles, takes his tray and walks away]"
1016,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?"
1017,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh..."
1018,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers."
1019,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Actually it was potato chips.
1020,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!"
1021,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room."
1022,13,5,Craig Tucker,Then just give him half.
1023,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1024,13,5,Craig Tucker,"I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half."
1025,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!"
1026,13,5,Craig Tucker,"Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon."
1027,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"""
1028,13,5,Craig Tucker,Just give him half.
1029,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills. [a doctor steps up next to him] Doctor, do I have gills?"
1030,13,5,Doctor,He does not have gills.
1031,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?
1032,13,5,Reporter 1,Do you like fishsticks?
1033,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Love 'em!
1034,13,5,Reporter 2,You're a gay fish. [a third reporter laughs and soon the rest of the room is laughing]
1035,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,No I'm not- AAAARGH! [grabs the sides of the podium and shakes with anger]
1036,13,5,Conan O Brien,"Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia."
1037,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"[dancing in his seat] Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!"
1038,13,5,Conan O Brien,"So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?"
1039,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, """"Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks?"" And my homeboy says ""Yeah Carlos"" you know, ""you're so funny!"" And then it just occurred to me. I said, ""Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!"" [the studio audience roars with laughter, and he begins to dance in his seat again] And this is how I came up with it, my amigos! [Conan claps. Cartman, looking at the show on TV, is pissed off]"
1040,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[shakes with rage, then turns left and walks away] Motherfucker!"
1041,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!"
1042,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Really?
1043,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!"
1044,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much."
1045,13,5,Eric Cartman,"But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!"
1046,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did."
1047,13,5,Eric Cartman,What?!
1048,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips."
1049,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?"
1050,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?"
1051,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'."
1052,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together."
1053,13,5,Sarah Valmer,Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.
1054,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish? [Jimmy and Cartman laugh, but Cartman notices something on Jimmy's desk.] Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! [gets off the couch, gets a newspaper, walks over to the desk, and smashes the spider dead.]"
1055,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, thanks Eric."
1056,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Is that... Is that how it happened?
1057,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew."
1058,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,I'm... I'm sorry?
1059,13,5,Eric Cartman,"It's cool man, it's cool. [turns around and walks away]"
1060,13,5,Announcer,"Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!"
1061,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"[gets onstage] Yo. Ungh. Yo. [turns to look at the audience] Yo, whoa! Whoa, what the hell?! [a lot of audience members carry signs saying that Kanye is a gay fish and that he likes fishsticks]"
1062,13,5,Audience,Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!
1063,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Yo, fuck this noise, yo! [throws down his mic and storms offstage]"
1064,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?"
1065,13,5,House,"Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it."
1066,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see... [he's writing on a whiteboard. So far he has ""Fishsticks + Me = Gayfish""] Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish."
1067,13,5,Aide 1,"Kanye, really..."
1068,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Shut up! [looks at the whiteboard again.] Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks? [adds more words to the board] They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim. [begins connecting words] Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?"
1069,13,5,House,"No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don't, don't you get it? You see, fish dicks is a is a play on words."
1070,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"I don't need anyone tellin' me ""play on words""! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!"
1071,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?"
1072,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing."
1073,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks off a bit] It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke. [Kyle zips up and goes to the sink to wash his hands] I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. [Kyle finishes up, grabs a paper towel, wipes his hands dry, and turns to Cartman]"
1074,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You know what, Cartman? I believe you."
1075,13,5,Eric Cartman,You do?
1076,13,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! [turns and leaves the bathroom]"
1077,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[after some thought] But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?"
1078,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?"
1079,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
1080,13,5,Eric Cartman,That's cool. You wanna write some together? [walks out of view]
1081,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
1082,13,5,Eric Cartman,"[pulls up a chair] Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks"
1083,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey, you're really onto something there."
1084,13,5,Sarah Valmer,"Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all."
1085,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer. [she walks off] Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?"""
1086,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Right. And then I say, ""Yeah."""
1087,13,5,Eric Cartman,"So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?"""
1088,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh wow, this is incredible! [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look at the source of the crash. A dragon wanders in]"
1089,13,5,Sarah Valmer,What is that?
1090,13,5,Eric Cartman,"It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! [leaps out of his seat with a sword out of nowhere and slashes the dragon across the chest, making it bleed. It falls on its back all of a sudden. Eric leaps onto its body and stabs the sword into its chest. It dies.]"
1091,13,5,Butters Stotch,"[looks through the window] Hey look, Eric killed a dragon."
1092,13,5,Clyde Donovan,[opens the front door] He's the most awesome kid in school!
1093,13,5,Wendy Testaburger,And he's not fat at all.
1094,13,5,Eric Cartman,Thanks you guys!
1095,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over."
1096,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?"
1097,13,5,Aide 2,"Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money."
1098,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Found who?
1099,13,5,Aide 2,"You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg."
1100,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"[tied down to a chair in Kanye's study, his voice shaking] Come on, maaaan. What is this, maaaan? What the fuck is goin' on maaaan? [Kanye enters the room. His entourage makes way] Oh fuck maaaan, Kanye Wehhst? Noo shiiit maaan, okay look it wasn't me. I didn't really start the fishstick thing, alriight?"
1101,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.
1102,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan."
1103,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!
1104,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick."
1105,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.
1106,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"Awww shih oh no man, come on, I got no dick, man! [Kanye's men whip out their own back and start whacking Mencia all over. His right hand gets broken, his left shin bleeds. The men stop as Kanye approaches him]"
1107,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"[in Mencia's face] Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish?"
1108,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan."
1109,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Why- Look at me, look at me! [Mencia manages to look at him] I love fishsticks. I love putting fishsticks in my mouth. [waits a while for an answer]"
1110,13,5,Carlos Mencia,"You're a- ...you're a gay fish, maaan. [Kanye backs up, swings at Mencia and decapitates him, leaving his head hanging from his body by some skin]"
1111,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it. [the audience laughs] But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer. [Cartman and Jimmy go onstage and sit on the couch facing Ellen] Hey guys!"
1112,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Hi Ellen. [to the audience] Do you guys like fishsticks? [the audience laughs] Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you."
1113,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?"
1114,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,It was just a-
1115,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you."
1116,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?"
1117,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-"
1118,13,5,Eric Cartman,Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. [the audience applauds and cheers]
1119,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,"That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?"
1120,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,Yes Ma'am. [the best and worst of times for him]
1121,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia."
1122,13,5,Ellen DeGeneres,I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? [Jimmy and Cartman are alarmed]
1123,13,5,Eric Cartman,Uhhh excuse me? [the crowd gets rowdy.]
1124,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play. [walks up to the wall-mounted TV and smashes it with the bat.]
1125,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials."
1126,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
1127,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that was kewl huh?"
1128,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Eric, there's something I really need to know."
1129,13,5,Eric Cartman,Whassat?
1130,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke. [Cartman gets worried] But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
1131,13,5,Eric Cartman,So... here it is.
1132,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
1133,13,5,Eric Cartman,"That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did! [Kanye kicks the bedroom door open and enters the room. His men pour in and start smashing the furniture apart] Dude, it's Puff Daddy!"
1134,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"Tie up these motherfuckers! [cut to the next scene, in which Kanye swings at a lamp and shatters it, then looks at his hostages] Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!"
1135,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are."
1136,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!
1137,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-"
1138,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!"
1139,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-"
1140,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!"
1141,13,5,Eric Cartman,Hello Jim.
1142,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!"
1143,13,5,Eric Cartman,[moves the glasses back over his cap] What are you up to?
1144,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough."
1145,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. [goes for a chair]"
1146,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. [hands his joke sheet to Cartman as Cartman brings the chair over and sits next to him]"
1147,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy."
1148,13,5,Sarah Valmer,"[brings in a plate of potato chips] Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat."
1149,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Thanks. [Sarah walks away] So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look around.]"
1150,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,What was that? [Butters opens the door and steps in]
1151,13,5,Butters Stotch,"Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! [outside, everyone scatters as robots march down the street firing off semiautomatic weapons. Cartman runs out to see what's happening. Butters and Jimmy follow right behind. Officer Barbrady and Mayor McDaniels look on helplessly]"
1152,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here? [takes off his glasses] Flame on! [becomes engulfed in flames and flies into the air. He then sends streams of flames at the robots, destroying them instantly. He flies back down to his starting point] Flame off! [the flames disappear. Other fourth graders appear: Annie, Millie, Red, Clyde, Token and Wendy]"
1153,13,5,Wendy Testaburger,"You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman."
1154,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke! [runs in and finishes the joke in a flourish. Jimmy walks in] ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! [other kids look in]"
1155,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!"
1156,13,5,Eric Cartman,Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
1157,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,What?!
1158,13,5,Eric Cartman,"You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault."
1159,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?"
1160,13,5,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now."
1161,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"What? I, I still don't get anything."
1162,13,5,Eric Cartman,"All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things."
1163,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Rih, r-r-really?"
1164,13,5,Eric Cartman,"I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are. [Kanye looks as if Cartman is talking about him] Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that."
1165,13,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding."
1166,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me. [walks up to the boys and genuflects before them] Boys I understand what you did now. [to his men] Untie them guys. I know what I have to do.
1167,13,5,Aide 2,Yo Kanye! You sure about this?
1168,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me. [turns and faces his entourage.] Let all my fans know I love 'em, but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever. Don't be sad for me guys! [turns around, runs, and dives into the ocean below] I'm goin' home! [his crew looks down into the water as Kanye begins swimming in his new environment]"
1169,13,5,Kanye West and his Aides/Entourage,"(Uh. Come on.)
I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down.
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish...
 'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl)
Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh)
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore
 'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said
That I had to make a switch (dead fish)...
Now I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a, I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (Yes, now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish."
1170,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Alright, [measures the length of the car's body] that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. [Stan holds on to the car's front end as Randy whips out a cordless drill. Randy bores into the rear end of the car as Sharon comes down the stairs.]"
1171,13,6,Sharon Marsh,"Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m."
1172,13,6,Randy Marsh,[looks over his shoulder] We know!
1173,13,6,Sharon Marsh,Well it's way past time for bed.
1174,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!"
1175,13,6,Sharon Marsh,Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
1176,13,6,Randy Marsh,"That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone! [turns his attention to the car again. Sharon goes upstairs] Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. [pulls out a small box]"
1177,13,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?"
1178,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year? [opens the box to reveal a small glowing metallic ball, picks it up with some tongs] I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field. [puts the small ball in the hole he just drilled out, then plugs the hole up with a stopper that lines up flush with the car body] There."
1179,13,6,Stan Marsh,What is that?
1180,13,6,Randy Marsh,"It's, uh it's nothing, really."
1181,13,6,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the Hadron particle super-collider in Switzerland, where authorities are shocked and baffled over the theft of a superconducting bending magnet created for use in tests with particle acceleration."
1182,13,6,Stan Marsh,"[watching TV] Oh no, he didn't."
1183,13,6,Reporter,"The superconducting magnet was stolen sometime last week. Surveillance cameras were able to record the theft on tape and police are now looking for [a picture of Randy dressed as Princess Leia] Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. Caught here in these photos, the troubled rebel princess is seen taking the superconducting magnet and then appearing disoriented as she tries to find her way out. [Stan buries his head into his right palm in shame] If you have any information of Princess Leia's whereabouts, please call your local police department."
1184,13,6,Pinewood Derby Judge,"Alright Scouts and Dads, the racing continues. And it looks like our next heat is ready to go, in 3, 2, 1, race! [four boys release their cars. Token and Butters are two of the boys. The cars slide down a ramp and onto the straightaway, and hit a barrier at the other end of the track. Neither Token nor Butters wins] Two point one seconds for Tommy Bretts. Looks like we have a new leader, folks."
1185,13,6,Tommy and His Dad,[hi-five each other] All right!
1186,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify. [kneels down next to Stan] Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about ""tells."""
1187,13,6,Stan Marsh,Tells?
1188,13,6,Randy Marsh,"When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear."
1189,13,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-"
1190,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. [rubs his neck and looks up and away. Stan notices and is shocked.]"
1191,13,6,Pinewood Derby Official,"Looks good. Thank you and good luck today. [the boy and his father leave, Stan and his father step up] Alright, next please. [Stan hands him his car. Randy rubs his neck again, then grins nervously] Name?"
1192,13,6,Stan Marsh,"It's uh, Marsh. [the official puts the car on a small stand, then measures and weighs it]"
1193,13,6,Pinewood Derby Official,"Alright, car weighs in at 15 ounces. Do you hearby swear that you used parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit and only parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit?"
1194,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[coaxing Stan through gritted teeth] Yes I do, yes I do."
1195,13,6,Stan Marsh,[in a resigned voice] Yes I do.
1196,13,6,Pinewood Derby Official,"Alright you man, good luck today. [hands the car back to Stan. He and Randy walk away]"
1197,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[to himself, pumping both fists] Oh! Yes! [nearby they run into Mr. Hollis and son]"
1198,13,6,Mr Hollis,"Well well, look son, it's the Marshes."
1199,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?"
1200,13,6,Mr Hollis,"No, little Emmett hasn't gone yet. Think they're saving the best for last. [pats Emmett's head and holds up their car] Clocked her in at home at 1.5 seconds. It's the fastest car we've ever built."
1201,13,6,Randy Marsh,One point five?
1202,13,6,Pinewood Derby Judge,"The time to beat is 1.9 seconds. May we please have... Brewster, Marsh, Jarvis, and Hollis. [the boys line up behind the starting gate, their cars in position. Emmett and Stan are next to each other]"
1203,13,6,Mr Hollis,"Huh, only fitting our boys should be going head to head for their match, hey Marsh? Heh. [sips from a can of Dr Pep-er]"
1204,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stan, you can do this! [claps enthusiastically]"
1205,13,6,Pinewood Derby Judge,"Alright, kids, are you ready? Here we go, last race for the state championship in 3, 2, 1, Go! [the boys release their cars and Emmett's car takes the lead.]"
1206,13,6,Mr Hollis,"You got it Emmett! [Stan's car begins to shimmy and spark, then stretch itself. It soon takes off, blowing hair and papers around. It crashes through the wall and up into the air outside, shearing off a tree limb. It kills a bird on its way up, then buzzes a passenger jet plane. It heads right out into space. Everyone in the competition goes outside and follows the car's trajectory]"
1207,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah! [jumps around] Oh yeah! [jabs a finger at Hollis] Suck on that, Hollis!"
1208,13,6,Announcer,This is Nine News at Ten.
1209,13,6,Anchorman,"A Colorado boy and his father have set a new record at the Pinewood Derby. [a picture of the two winners appears over his left shoulder] Stan and Randy Marsh not only broke a speed record, but actually appear to have bent time and space and discovered warp speed. [Emmett is watching the news on his couch, sad that he lost] A parade was held for the winners earlier today [they're riding on a space shuttle float during the parade], and already offers for commercials and endorsement deals for the father and son appear to be pouring in. [Emmett goes to his father's study and trophy room and watches him]"
1210,13,6,Emmett Hollis and Dad,"Dad, I just want you to know I still love you. [a gun is cocked and Mr. Hollis kills himself with a gunshot through the head. The head and left arm quickly fall to his desk.] Waaaagh! [begins to hyperventilate] He's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK-"
1211,13,6,Agent Clark,Stan Marsh?
1212,13,6,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
1213,13,6,Agent Clark,I'm Agent Clark [on the left] and this is Agent Marx [on the right. Both men whip out their badges. They are members of the NSA] We'd like to talk to you about your Pinewood Derby car.
1214,13,6,Stan Marsh,"Aw crap, Dad! [the men enter the house and walk past Stan. He closes the door behind them]"
1215,13,6,Agent Clark,"Young man, what we are about to tell you is a matter of national security. Yesterday every country and embassy on Earth was contacted by... an alien life force."
1216,13,6,Stan Marsh,Alien?
1217,13,6,Agent Marx,[they turn around] Apparently the alien came across your Pinewood Derby car and is now headed to our planet.
1218,13,6,Stan Marsh,What does it want?
1219,13,6,Agent Clark,We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.
1220,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[coming down the stairs with a cup of coffee] Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-? [jumps back when he sees the men] Aw crap! [walks towards them defensively] What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!"
1221,13,6,Stan Marsh,Dad they aren't here for that.
1222,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[lowers his guard and shakes Agent Marx's hand] Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh."
1223,13,6,Agent Clark,"Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life."
1224,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[surprised, softly] What? [looks to his right and says normally] Hey, hey Sharon."
1225,13,6,Agent Marx,"NASA's confirmed that an alien ship has entered our solar system and it is headed here,"
1226,13,6,Randy Marsh,"So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space."
1227,13,6,Sharon Marsh,[walks in from the kitchen with her own cup of coffee] What? Oh my God.
1228,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?"
1229,13,6,Reporter,"The world holds its breath as an alien ship prepares to land. Now that our planet has achieved warp speed, we're about to be welcomed into the universal society. All thanks to a father and son who broke the warp barrier using only the parts in this [holds up a packet] Pinewood Derby car kit."
1230,13,6,General,"Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. [gives him a cell phone. Randy's now on a conference call]"
1231,13,6,Randy Marsh,Hullo?
1232,13,6,Britain,"Godspeed, Mr.Marsh."
1233,13,6,France,Ze nation of France iz with you.
1234,13,6,Japan,"Good ruck witha 'harien, Mista Marsh."
1235,13,6,China,Prease say herro froma China.
1236,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. [A huge shadow falls over South Park as the ship descends. Three metallic feet come out of the bottom of the ship and set themselves on the asphalt, allowing the ship to land softly]"
1237,13,6,Reporter,"Our first encounter with extraterrestrial life is about to happen. Will it be like in Star Trek: First Contact? Or will it be more like Contact, with Jody Foster? [the ship's doors open, a virtual ramp appears, and the alien walks down the ramp to the street.]"
1238,13,6,Alien,I seek the life forms that made this. [holds up the car Stan launched into space.]
1239,13,6,Randy Marsh,"That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan."
1240,13,6,Alien,"Oh yeah? [affects the manners and voice of a 1930's mobster, holds up a ray gun] You're gonna build me another one, see?"
1241,13,6,Randy Marsh,He's got a gun!
1242,13,6,Alien,"Everyone down on the ground! [everyone gets on the ground with their hands over their heads] Get those hands up! Let me see those hands! Do it now! I mean it! Show me those hands! I'm Baby Fark McGee-zax, the greatest gangster this universe has ever seen, right?!"
1243,13,6,Townsman,You can't threaten us! [a blast from the alien's gun injures his thigh and he goes down] Ow!
1244,13,6,McGee zax,"Who wants it next, huh?! [a shot of the crowd at Times Square] Anyone else on this planet wanna be a hero? [the crowd there covers its head, as do the various world leaders]"
1245,13,6,Randy Marsh,What do you want?
1246,13,6,McGee zax,"I'm on the lam. Got the entire Federation of Planets after me. But they ain't gonna catch me, ya got that?! They might have busted my warp drive, but you obviously know how to make 'em! [tosses the car to Randy, who catches it]"
1247,13,6,New Yorker,Screw this guy! He can't take out all of us! [McGee-zax fires into the air and the New Yorker gets a sparking sting on his right shoulder] Aargh!
1248,13,6,McGee zax,"I can kill any mug on this two-bit planet I want! [a shot of McGee-zax from Akihabara, Tokyo. The Japanese cower and react to his image] You build me a new warp drive or you're all gonna get it, see?!"
1249,13,6,Pinewood Derby Judge,Fine. He can build you what you want. All he needs is the official Pinewood Derby kit. Right Marsh?
1250,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan? [under his breath] Oh boy."
1251,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son."
1252,13,6,McGee zax,What's takin' so long?! You're stallin'!
1253,13,6,Stephen Stotch,"Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone."
1254,13,6,Randy Marsh,We're working on it! [McGee-zax begins to pace back and forth behind them]
1255,13,6,Stan Marsh,"[whispering] Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit."
1256,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[whispering] Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that."
1257,13,6,Stan Marsh,[whispering] Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
1258,13,6,Randy Marsh,[whispering] Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
1259,13,6,McGee zax,"Alright, that does it! [fires off another shot into the sky. A second later Randy gets a call on his cell phone]"
1260,13,6,Randy Marsh,Hello?
1261,13,6,Italy,They justa blew up our government building! Ya got to hurry!
1262,13,6,Britain,"Mr. Marsh, why won't you finish the Pinewood Derby car?!"
1263,13,6,Randy Marsh,Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
1264,13,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean."
1265,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[feeling the stress of urgency] Awhuh. [a siren sounds in the distance. In the sky another space ship shows up, with police sirens on it]"
1266,13,6,McGee zax,"Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police."
1267,13,6,Randy Marsh,What?! [McGee-zax pulls out a small remote control from his left front pocket and aims it at his ship. One click and the ship is cloaked in invisibility. McGee-zax then takes Stan captive and backs away holding a gun to Stan's head]
1268,13,6,McGee zax,"You'd better get rid of 'em or your whole planet is gonna get it, see?! [goes towards South Park Market] You tell 'em you ain't seen nothin', you got that?! [the sliding doors open and he takes Stan into the store] I ain't goin' to space jail! [the doors close. The police ship lands and two space officers come out and walk down their ramps to the ground. One officer has two mouths, the other just one. Both of them have four eyes and broad shoulders]"
1269,13,6,Officer 1,"'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?"
1270,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh, no. [pulls at his ear vigorously] We haven't seen anything."
1271,13,6,Officer 1,"Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?"
1272,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax."
1273,13,6,China,"Uh uh no, no, we haven't seen arien."
1274,13,6,France,Uh we've seen nothing here in France.
1275,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?"
1276,13,6,Officer 1,He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
1277,13,6,Randy Marsh,"No, we're sure."
1278,13,6,Officer 1,So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?
1279,13,6,Randy Marsh,"That's right, yep, you're the first ones."
1280,13,6,Officer 1,You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
1281,13,6,Randy Marsh,"...Uh. That's r-. That's right! [shakes his head in mock surprise] Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!"
1282,13,6,Officer 1,[hands Randy his translucent shimmering business card] If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-
1283,13,6,Randy Marsh,We will give you a call!
1284,13,6,Officer 1,"Mathematical semi-tonal is fine. [the space officers go back up their ramps to the ship, the ramps vanish behind them. Two blinking orbs appear above the ship and it takes off.]"
1285,13,6,Officer 1,Huh.
1286,13,6,Officer 2,"[uses both mouths] Something wrong, sir?"
1287,13,6,Officer 1,"I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. [blinks]"
1288,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before."
1289,13,6,McGee zax,"I don't need it painted, I just need it functional, all right?! [waves the gun around]"
1290,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!"
1291,13,6,Scout Leader,That's true.
1292,13,6,McGee zax,"I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for!"
1293,13,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated."
1294,13,6,Randy Marsh,"No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien."
1295,13,6,Stan Marsh,[alarmed] Kill the alien?
1296,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck."
1297,13,6,Stan Marsh,"No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen."
1298,13,6,McGee zax,"What are you two whispering about, riiight?"
1299,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look."
1300,13,6,Stan Marsh,Dad? [McGee-zax comes in for a closer look]
1301,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here. [McGee-zax studies the axles, and Stan jabs him in the neck with the shank, making him bleed and vomit profusely and then die] Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!"
1302,13,6,General,"Alright men, check the ship. [he and a bunch of lab techs board the ship and look around]"
1303,13,6,Randy Marsh,[kneels by Stan] You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
1304,13,6,Stan Marsh,I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
1305,13,6,Randy Marsh,"But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again."
1306,13,6,General,"Hey Marsh, get in here! [Randy gets up and goes up the ramp into the ship. Stan follows.]"
1307,13,6,Stephen Stotch,Can you believe it?
1308,13,6,Randy Marsh,Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. [Before them is a towering pile of glittering blue bills]
1309,13,6,General,Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
1310,13,6,Randy Marsh,Right. [takes out his phone but has second thoughts.] But what if we didn't call the cops?
1311,13,6,Stephen Stotch,Huh?
1312,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Well I mean... [walks up to the pile] this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it."
1313,13,6,Stan Marsh,"No, Dad-"
1314,13,6,Mr Garrison,He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
1315,13,6,General,"All right, let's get the cash put into boxes! [the men get to work]"
1316,13,6,Stan Marsh,"Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?"
1317,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Will you relax, Stan? [his phone rings and he answers it]"
1318,13,6,Japan,Don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself!
1319,13,6,Germany,That's right! This is all of our planet; the space cash belongs to all of us!
1320,13,6,Australia,Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!
1321,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around! [hangs up on the leaders] Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! [the general and other federal agents take the space cash away in boxes as Randy grins]"
1322,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else! [A siren is heard. Randy looks up to the sky and sees the space cops returning, but forgets to cloak the ship] Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on. [the police ship lands and the alien officers exit their ship] Ah hey, space officers."
1323,13,6,Officer 1,Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
1324,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him."
1325,13,6,Officer 1,"And so, did you find the missing space cash?"
1326,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[thinks a moment] Nnno. Space cash? No. [strokes his ear, then rubs his neck with his left hand] There wasn't any space cash."
1327,13,6,Officer 2,Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?
1328,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?"
1329,13,6,Russia,No space cash.
1330,13,6,Japan,No we haven't-
1331,13,6,Britain,No space cash.
1332,13,6,Brazil,No.
1333,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here."
1334,13,6,Officer 1,Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
1335,13,6,Randy Marsh,[relieved] Probably.
1336,13,6,Officer 1,"Well you folks all take care now. [the officers turn to leave, but they turn around once again] Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days."
1337,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[silent for a moment] Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks."
1338,13,6,Officer 1,Uh huh. Have a good day. [the officers turn and head up the ramps. The doors close and the police ship leaves the planet once again]
1339,13,6,Randy Marsh,[gets back on the phone] Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet! [a shot of the Mexican president at his desk with a new water park right outside his window] What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
1340,13,6,Randy Marsh,"No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!"
1341,13,6,Japan,Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!
1342,13,6,Randy Marsh,Nobody can build anything!!
1343,13,6,Britain,"Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!"
1344,13,6,Randy Marsh,Wha?! Finland?! [Stan walks by the kitchen to see what's going on]
1345,13,6,Finland,We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.
1346,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[getting exasperated] Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything."
1347,13,6,Finland,"I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore."
1348,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Okay okay! [Stan leaves] You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?"
1349,13,6,Finland,Very well. [goes on hold]
1350,13,6,Randy Marsh,"All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland."
1351,13,6,China,"Yep, we gotta take out Finrand, they gonna squeal."
1352,13,6,Australia,"Yeah, I think we all agree. Guys? [eight leaders are shown onscreen and they all agree]"
1353,13,6,Randy Marsh,Oh dammit!
1354,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?"
1355,13,6,Officer 1,"Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?"
1356,13,6,Randy Marsh,[rubs his neck again] Whaa-wha-what about it
1357,13,6,Officer 2,It appears to have been... destroyed.
1358,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[feigning surprise] Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland."
1359,13,6,Crowd,"Oh no, not Finland."
1360,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Hey guys, Finland's dead."
1361,13,6,Russia,Oh no. No! Nooo.
1362,13,6,Japan,"Noo, not a Finrand!"
1363,13,6,Kenya,"All of Finland, gone."
1364,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close."
1365,13,6,Officer 1,None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
1366,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[rubs his neck again] No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide."
1367,13,6,Officer 2,We didn't say anything about nukes.
1368,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'."
1369,13,6,Stan Marsh,"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me! [the crowd makes way for him as he walks up to the ship] Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! [hands it to the judge]"
1370,13,6,Pinewood Derby Judge,[takes the trophy] What?
1371,13,6,Randy Marsh,Stan?
1372,13,6,Stan Marsh,"The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. [the crowd reacts to this admission.]"
1373,13,6,Japan,Not in the approved kit?!
1374,13,6,Britain,He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?
1375,13,6,Stan Marsh,"This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. [everyone, including the world leaders from Kenya and South Korea, hangs on Stan's every word]"
1376,13,6,Randy Marsh,"Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son."
1377,13,6,Officer 1,Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?
1378,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[gets on the phone with the other leaders] Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?"
1379,13,6,Britain,Nope.
1380,13,6,France,Nope.
1381,13,6,South Korea,No changes.
1382,13,6,Kenya,Nope.
1383,13,6,Russia,No changes.
1384,13,6,Brazil,Nope.
1385,13,6,China,No. Tell them no.
1386,13,6,Australia,No changes.
1387,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[rubs his neck] Yeah, no, we've told you everything."
1388,13,6,Officer 1,"All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. [a door on the lower level of the ship drops down from the outer wall to become a ramp, and a figure stands at the entrance, then walks down the ramp. The figure looks familiar...]"
1389,13,6,Randy Marsh,"[jumps back in horror] Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!"
1390,13,6,McGee zax,My real name is Kevern Zaksor. I am the ambassador to new planet testing. [Stan and Randy look at each other]
1391,13,6,Britain,What the hell are they talking about?
1392,13,6,Kevern Zaksor,"These are not space cops. [the officers remove their helmets] There is no space jail, and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth. I mean, how stupid is your species? Space jail? Baby Fark McGee-zax?"
1393,13,6,Randy Marsh,It was... a trick?
1394,13,6,Officer 2,"Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining."
1395,13,6,Kevern Zaksor,"Needless to say, you all failed. [he and the two officers go back inside the ship. He turns at his door's entrance and clears his throat] People of earth, since you did not return the space cash, your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe. Goodbye. [his door closes. The ramps all go back into the ship and the ship takes off]"
1396,13,6,Randy Marsh,"No heywaitwait, no! [the ship zooms away from the planet and leaves behind two probes that evolve into a cube of energy shields] Well that sucks!"
1397,13,7,Eric Cartman,You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
1398,13,7,Butters Stotch,We can?
1399,13,7,Stan Marsh,"What are you talking about, dude?"
1400,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Haven't you assholes been watching the news? [rolls the map flat on the table] Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here: [points to the circled nation on the map] Somalia."
1401,13,7,Clyde Donovan,Somalia? Where's that?
1402,13,7,Eric Cartman,"North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath."
1403,13,7,Butters Stotch,[in thrall] Whoa.
1404,13,7,Eric Cartman,"I've worked it all out on Expedia. [traces the route from Denver to Somalia] We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want."
1405,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia."
1406,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Right, and wi- [stops] Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle."
1407,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket."
1408,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow."
1409,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life."
1410,13,7,Eric Cartman,Then why don't you wanna go?
1411,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know..."
1412,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,Jews can't be pirates.
1413,13,7,Eric Cartman,Jews can't be pirates.
1414,13,7,Eric Cartman,"That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle. [rolls up the map] Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! [walks away]"
1415,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,[puts his hands together and prays] Please. Please let him go.
1416,13,7,Gordon Stoltski,"Good morning, students. These are the morning announcements. Teacher-parent conferences have been rescheduled to next Tuesday. [Mr. Garrison reads during the announcements] Please inform your parents. The gym is being repainted, and is closed until tomorrow afternoon. And now for a special announcement:"
1417,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Avast there, mateys! [the class looks up at the speaker] Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life? [a shot of some kids in the hall, including sixth graders] Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time? [a shot of the kindergarten class, and its teacher] Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr! [back to Mr. Garrison's class] Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends! [Kyle looks at the blackboard, his eyes half-closed. Stan begins to write stuff down] Even Kyle said so. [Kyle buries his face into his desk] Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house!"
1418,13,7,Kevin Stoley,At my house? Why my house?
1419,13,7,Eric Cartman,"There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!"
1420,13,7,Gordon Stoltski,"And for lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving taco salad or hoagie sandwiches. Thank you."
1421,13,7,Butters Stotch,"Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates. [only four kids showed up - Kevin, Ike, Clyde, and Gordon Stoltski] Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! [blows into a whistle. To his left, by the stairs, is a door with a sign, ""Captain"" on it. Cartman enters the room though that door.]"
1422,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh... [sees Gordon Stoltski, then goes into a low voice] Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?"
1423,13,7,Clyde Donovan,"Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join."
1424,13,7,Eric Cartman,"But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here."
1425,13,7,Gordon Stoltski,"Fine, I don't wanna be a pirate anyways! [leaves his seat and goes out the stairs and out of the basement]"
1426,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!"
1427,13,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
1428,13,7,Eric Cartman,We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
1429,13,7,Clyde Donovan,And your mom is okay with that?
1430,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?"
1431,13,7,Butters Stotch,Neato!
1432,13,7,Eric Cartman,Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! [holds up a jewelled sword]
1433,13,7,Butters Stotch,Pirates ho! [holds up his own small sword. The others follow suit with daggers]
1434,13,7,Clyde Donovan,Pirates ho!
1435,13,7,Ike Broflovski,Pirates ho!
1436,13,7,Kevin Stoley,Ho! [his sword is a lightsaber. Cartman looks at it in disbelief]
1437,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Kevin, Goddammit! [Kevin turns off the lightsaber's light]"
1438,13,7,Clerk,"Have a good flight. Next, please? [Cartman approaches with his crew. He hands the clerk his payment]"
1439,13,7,Eric Cartman,"We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!"
1440,13,7,Clerk,[slowly] I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
1441,13,7,Eric Cartman,"That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card."
1442,13,7,Butters Stotch,[has second thoughts and turns around] Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
1443,13,7,Eric Cartman,What?!
1444,13,7,Butters Stotch,"It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it."
1445,13,7,Clyde Donovan,Yeah maybe we should think about this.
1446,13,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?"
1447,13,7,Butters Stotch,"Huh, who, you mean you?"
1448,13,7,Eric Cartman,Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
1449,13,7,Butters Stotch,"No, I'm sick of it!"
1450,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?"
1451,13,7,Butters Stotch,"He's right, lads. To adventure!"
1452,13,7,Clyde Donovan,This is Somalia?
1453,13,7,Butters Stotch,Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
1454,13,7,Eric Cartman,"The FUCK?! [some Somalis notice them and stop to look] 'Scuse me, where are the pirates? [stops a man walking by] Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh! [the man ignores him and keeps on walking.] Butters, get the phrase book out. [Butters approaches with the phrase book in hand] Ask these people where the pirates are."
1455,13,7,Butters Stotch,"Uhh, [mumbles a bit] mahjey burazi?"
1456,13,7,Somali 1,Burad. Iyaja dene zaredeko
1457,13,7,Somali 2,Buradi wakuwasa.
1458,13,7,Butters Stotch,Oh. He-he says they're in there. [points to his left. A mustard-colored building is being defended by two guards.]
1459,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! [the boys turn and walk towards the building]"
1460,13,7,Somali 2,"Mayasuk! Hageha-aden! Letka suwahater! [Translation: ""No! wait! Don't go in there! Those people are dangerous!""]"
1461,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. [dismissing the warning, he and his crew continue on to the building.]"
1462,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Avast! [no one else says a word. In a low voice, he says] These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people."
1463,13,7,Pirate 1,"""Is this some kind of joke?"""
1464,13,7,Pirate 2,"""I don't know what the fuck this is!"""
1465,13,7,Eric Cartman,I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
1466,13,7,Pirate 1,"""These white children will bring a high price in ransom money!"""
1467,13,7,Pirate 2,"""Take them out to the nearest European boat! Show them we have children hostages!"" [surrounding pirates stand up with their rifles]"
1468,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates."
1469,13,7,Pirate 3,"[wearing a #13 jersey] ""Move it! Go over that way!"""
1470,13,7,Pirate 4,"[wearing a mustard-colored shirt] ""We will get a nice ransom for you!"" [the fifth pirate wears a black shirt]"
1471,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. [they all stop next to a small boat]"
1472,13,7,Pirate 3,"""Get on board!"""
1473,13,7,Pirate 4,"""Do it now!"" [the boys turn to see the boat the pirates want them on]"
1474,13,7,Eric Cartman,"This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!"
1475,13,7,Pirate 3,"""Get on the boat now!"""
1476,13,7,Pirate 4,"""Move!"""
1477,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front."
1478,13,7,Kevin Stoley,I gotta sit middle 'cause I get motion sickness. [the other boys climb in and all four end up on the same row]
1479,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Kevin, Jesus Christ! [a pirate starts the motor and the boat moves forward] Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah! [Clyde begins to cry] Clyde, the fuck?!"
1480,13,7,Clyde Donovan,You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! [continues crying]
1481,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!"
1482,13,7,Clyde Donovan,No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
1483,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please? [Ike looks at Clyde and smacks him. Clyde stops crying] Very nice, Ike. [looks ahead] All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! [before them is a French cruise ship]"
1484,13,7,French Captain,"""Keep your eyes open, Mr. Leon. These waters are full of renegades and thieves."""
1485,13,7,Mr Leon,"[ship's navigator] ""Yes, Captain!"" [an alarm sounds and the captain leaves the bridge to find out what's going on.]"
1486,13,7,Deck Hand,"[sees the captain and approaches] ""Captain! We have an unknown vessel approaching quickly to port!"""
1487,13,7,French Captain,"""Damn pirates! Alert the crew! All hands on deck!"" [the little boat pulls up next to the cruise ship. The captain and his crew gather in front of the bridge and the captain looks at the pirates through his binoculars]"
1488,13,7,Pirate 5,"[through a bullhorn] ""We demand ransom for these children! Pay us or we will kill them!"""
1489,13,7,French Captain,"""They've got CHILDREN HOSTAGES!"""
1490,13,7,Cruise Attendant,"""My God!"""
1491,13,7,French Captain,"""Get the U.N. on the radio. Advise them of the situation."""
1492,13,7,Pirate 5,"""We want 5,000 Euros! You easily have that much on board!"""
1493,13,7,Eric Cartman,Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this. [takes the bullhorn from him] Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!
1494,13,7,Pirate 4,"[moves over to Cartman and aims his rifle at him] ""We are going to start killing them! Starting with the fat one!"""
1495,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!"
1496,13,7,Butters Stotch,ARRRRRRGH!
1497,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?"
1498,13,7,Stan Marsh,"[in the kitchen at his house] No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia."
1499,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
1500,13,7,Stan Marsh,You really think he'll die in Somalia?
1501,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[chuckles] Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here."
1502,13,7,Sheila Broflovski,"[voice only, but soon comes down the stairs with Gerald behind her] Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! [She has a letter in her hand. Kyle's happiness vanishes]"
1503,13,7,Gerald Broflovski,Take it easy. We'll find him.
1504,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'll call you back. [hangs up. Sheila approaches him.]
1505,13,7,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!"
1506,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,What? Are you sure?
1507,13,7,Sheila Broflovski,He left a note saying he's never coming back.
1508,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[takes the note and reads it aloud] ""Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!"
1509,13,7,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh Gerald, what are we gonna do?"
1510,13,7,Gerald Broflovski,"It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. [leaves with Sheila and the phone]"
1511,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God. What have I done?
1512,13,7,Pirate 4,"""We are growing impatient! Give us what we want or they die!"""
1513,13,7,Eric Cartman,The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
1514,13,7,French Captain,"""Alright! Alright! We are going to give you what you want! But you must hand over the children UNHARMED!"""
1515,13,7,Pirate 5,"""The money first!"" [a crewman throws down a bag of money to the small boat and one of the pirates catches it and opens it. A rope ladder is unforled so the boys could climb up to the cruise ship] ""Go! Get on the boat! Move!"""
1516,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright, let's go! [the boys go up the ladder and board the ship]"
1517,13,7,Cruise Attendant,"""We got 'em - They're safe!"" [the pirate boat turns and zooms away]"
1518,13,7,French Captain,[to the pirates] Your crimes will not go unpunished! [turns and faces the kids] Are you kids alright?
1519,13,7,Cruise Attendant,"""Did they hurt you?"""
1520,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!"
1521,13,7,French Captain,"""What is this?!"""
1522,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!"
1523,13,7,Butters Stotch,Okay! [runs off to plunder]
1524,13,7,Eric Cartman,"I said, get off my boat!"
1525,13,7,French Captain,"""Hey! You can't order us around!"" [Kevin walks up with his lightsaber and turns it on. The captain and crew jump back. Kevin waves it around, Cartman rolls his eyes to the right, and the captain and crew move in that direction. They all head to a lifeboat, with the captain and crew going ""Qu'est-ce que passe? Mon Dieu!""]"
1526,13,7,Eric Cartman,"That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs! [the captain and crew get on the lifeboat] Lower 'em down, Ike. [Ike lowers the lifeboat to the ocean]"
1527,13,7,French Captain,"""Scoundrels! You will pay for this!"""
1528,13,7,Butters Stotch,Have a good day! [the lifeboat is safely on the water. Cartman quickly begins to make changes. The French flag comes down and the skull and bones one goes up. Cartman walks up to the the ship's bow]
1529,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Hard to port, lads!"
1530,13,7,Clyde Donovan,[relaying the message] Hard to port!
1531,13,7,Butters Stotch,"[at the wheel. Ike stands on a stool next to him] What's ""port""?!"
1532,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Just make the boat go that way, kind of. [the ship ends up turning towards shore, towards the pirates' lair. The pirates have just finished tying up their boat when they stop and look towards the sea. The ship's horn blows and the ship heads towards the dock] That's good. Now bring her around portside. [the cruise ship pulls up alongside the pier and lowers the rope ladder. The boys get off the ship and head back to the lair. Cartman stops for a moment and points it out to the pirates] Now that's a pirate ship! [the boys head into the pirates' lair] A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves? [starts tossing wads of cash at pirates] Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around. [walks to an open table and has the boys sit there] A round of grog for me boys! [a pirate brings drinks to the table and passes them out] A round of grog for everyone! [the pirate leaves] The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates! [gets up and walks around] Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy! [the pirate he's looking at has lost his left leg from the knee down] Look at this guy for Christ's sake! [rips a leg from a chair and ties it up the pirate's left leg] I mean, how hard is this, people?! [the pirate grins and hobbles away with his new peg leg. Cartman walks back to the boys' table, then stands on it]  I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!
Weee drink and we pillage and we do what we please! We get all that we want for free!"

1560,13,7,Paolo Captain,"We found then adrift in a lifeboat, sir. They say that pirates took their ship by force."
1561,13,7,U N Leader,Damn pirates! What's causing them to suddenly be so much more active? Is the crew okay?
1562,13,7,Paolo Captain,"Yes sir. They're French, so they surrendered immediately. [addresses the crew] Once the pirates boarded your ship how did they force you off?"
1563,13,7,French Captain,Il a vert lightsabeur.
1564,13,7,Cruise Attendant,Oui. Un lightsabeur
1565,13,7,Deck Hand,"Le lightsabeur terrible. [does lightsaber sound effects, then sobs.]"
1566,13,7,Paolo Captain,"Sir, the pirates appear to have forced the French crew off their boat with a lightsaber."
1567,13,7,U N Leader,"My God, pirates are getting better-equipped every day! Gentlemen, I want the President of the United States on the phone. We can no longer fight the pirates on the seas. We have to take them out where they live."
1568,13,7,Eric Cartman,"What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh? [a shot is heard, followed by commotion from the pirates. Cartman and the boys walk over to a crowd of pirates gathered around something] What's going on?"
1569,13,7,Pirate 6,"""We have a hostage!"""
1570,13,7,Pirate 7,"""Another American arrived on the bus!"""
1571,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom. [the crowd splits in two and Kyle is shown. Kyle is tied up so he can't use his arms. Ike looks happy to see Kyle.] Well well well well well!"
1572,13,7,Announcer,The is CNN... N.
1573,13,7,CNNN Anchorman,Breaking news of yet another pirate crisis in Somalia. Members of NATO received word today that pirates have captured an American child and are demanding ten million Euros for his safe release. U.S Navy ships have been deployed and the pirate standoff is about to get ugly.
1574,13,7,Eric Cartman,Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
1575,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe."
1576,13,7,Eric Cartman,"""It isn't safe."" That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was ""awesome."""
1577,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,I know! I was lying then!
1578,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home."
1579,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive! [a fish walks out of the water on hind legs, squawks, turn around and goes back into the ocean] Cartman, just give me my brother [Cartman turns around and faces Kyle] and let us get out of here!"
1580,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm."
1581,13,7,Butters Stotch,"One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches."
1582,13,7,Pirate 4,[walks up to the two boys] Ey excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
1583,13,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed."
1584,13,7,Galeed,Why did you Americans come here?
1585,13,7,Butters Stotch,"Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework."
1586,13,7,Ike Broflovski,"Yeah, homework."
1587,13,7,Butters Stotch,And our parents hollered at us!
1588,13,7,Ike Broflovski,Yeah.
1589,13,7,Butters Stotch,So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
1590,13,7,Ike Broflovski,Piewets!
1591,13,7,Galeed,"But that's not what I do not understand. Why would anyone ""want"" to be a pirate?"
1592,13,7,Butters Stotch,Huh?
1593,13,7,Galeed,"Every day I dream that I can go to school. Learn about the world. But my mother, she is dyin' of AIDS, and there is no money for medicine. My father was killed trying to find food for us. Do you know how I feel every time we try to capture a boat? Scared. And not just scared because I might get killed, but scared because if I don't get something out of it, my family and friends are going to die. I don't want to be a pirate. I don't see how anybody would. [turns and quickly runs out of the lair.]"
1594,13,7,Ike Broflovski,Oh my God. [rests his head against a chair]
1595,13,7,Butters Stotch,"Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?"
1596,13,7,Ike Broflovski,"I feel, like an asshole."
1597,13,7,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, me too."
1598,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!"
1599,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, knock it off!"
1600,13,7,Eric Cartman,"That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!"
1601,13,7,Pirate 6,"""Do you think all American kids are as crazy as these are?"""
1602,13,7,Pirate 8,"""It's starting to look that way."""
1603,13,7,Butters Stotch,"[runs up to Eric with Ike in tow] Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home."
1604,13,7,Eric Cartman,What?!
1605,13,7,Butters Stotch,"Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. [Clyde begins to cry again]"
1606,13,7,Eric Cartman,Clyde!
1607,13,7,Clyde Donovan,I hate it here and I wanna go home!! [begins to bawl]
1608,13,7,Eric Cartman,"[threatens the other three boys with his sword; they back down] You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!"
1609,13,7,Kyle Broflovski,They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
1610,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit! [whistles] To arms! [the real pirates gather around and aim their rifles at the boys] Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!"
1611,13,7,Pirate 5,"""Hey, what's that?"" [in the distance a U.S. ship gets into position]"
1612,13,7,Commander,"Alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!"
1613,13,7,Eric Cartman,"Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! [a volley of bullets takes down all the pirates, leaving the six boys unharmed. The boys look at the carnage around them]"
1614,13,7,Sniper,[several seconds later] Clear.
1615,13,7,Eric Cartman,The FUCK?!
1616,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,[voice over] You have been very very naughty! [a shot of Kyle's parents having sex in bed] You're a naughty girl! [begins to grunt with every thrust]
1617,13,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty! [joins in the grunting for a few seconds] Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! [their bedroom door opens]"
1618,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[quickly turns around and faces the door] What the?! ...Ike! [Ike is at the bedroom entrance looking scared. He's dragging a puppy plushie around] Ike, get back to bed right now!"
1619,13,8,Ike Broflovski,I'm scared. There's a ghost.
1620,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, not this again. [angrily] Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!"
1621,13,8,Ike Broflovski,But Daddy I saw the-
1622,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,"No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! [Ike turns left and walks out of view, his head hanging]"
1623,13,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, what has gotten into him?"
1624,13,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[sighing] Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he just freaked himself out."
1625,13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for Megascrub Cleanser."
1626,13,8,Ike Broflovski,AAAAAAAAA!
1627,13,8,Billy Mays,"Are you tired of your kitchen counters getting those nasty stains? Don't just rub 'em, Megascrub 'em!"
1628,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"Billy Mays, NO! [jumps out of bed and runs into his closet. The camera pans out...]"
1629,13,8,Billy Mays,"[...and Billy is in the closet too] Mold, mildew, even those impossible wine stains are gone in a flash when you snipe them away."
1630,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"[runs out of the closet, through his room, and into the hallway.] MMOOMMMYYY! [runs towards the stairs and passes another room. Another celebrity appears in the entrance] AAAAAA! Farrah Fawcett! Farrah Fawcett! [runs to a door opposite the room and opens it. A man appears hanging from the ceiling in that room, wearing fishnet stockings] AAAAAA! David Carradine! [runs away from that room and heads for the stairs, but stops in his tracks and gasps]"
1631,13,8,Billy Mays,"[walking up the stairs] Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Mend It, the fast and easy way to mend, hem, and wear it again. [Ike backs away towards his room]"
1632,13,8,Ike Broflovski,NOOOOO!
1633,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[comes out of his room] Ike! Ike, what?!"
1634,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away! [Kyle looks, but nothing is there] Make him stop! [buries his face in Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him] Make him stop, Kyle!"
1635,13,8,Dr Land,"Now Ike, your family is very worried about you. Ike, you can talk to me. I'm a therapist. Whatever has been troubling you, it's okay."
1636,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"No, it's... it's a secret."
1637,13,8,Dr Land,"Ike, tell me your secret. I promise not to tell anyone else."
1638,13,8,Ike Broflovski,[turns his head to the right to look at the doctor] I see dead... ce-le-bri-ties.
1639,13,8,Dr Land,"You mean, you see dead celebrities on TV? In the news?"
1640,13,8,Ike Broflovski,I see them walking around. They talk to me.
1641,13,8,Dr Land,Are you seeing any dead celebrities right now?
1642,13,8,Ike Broflovski,"Just Ed McMahon. [Ed McMahon's ghost looks at Ike over Dr. Land's right shoulder, then turns right and walks off]"
1643,13,8,Dr Land,How often do you see dead celebrities?
1644,13,8,Ike Broflovski,All the time. [blinks a few times]
1645,13,8,Eric Cartman,"'Sup, Jew?"
1646,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities."
1647,13,8,Eric Cartman,HA! What a dumbass! [Kenny mumbles a question]
1648,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again."
1649,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Billy Mays? Billy Mays?! [hops off the sofa] Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!"
1650,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1651,13,8,Eric Cartman,Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
1652,13,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't even know who that is."
1653,13,8,Eric Cartman,"The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here! [quickly flips through the channels until a Billy Mays commercial appears] Here here! This, this is him!"
1654,13,8,Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle [shows off two Chipotle burritos], but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear [shows off bloodstained underwear]."
1655,13,8,Man 1,[holding a burrito in his right hand] I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. [a shriek is added for emphasis]
1656,13,8,Billy Mays,"[now near a washer and dryer] Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear. Chipotl-away. [shows off the bottle, which says Chipotlaway. What follows is a demonstration of how the product works] Just one Chipotle burrito [shown] can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood [a quarter cup of red liquid is poured onto the briefs], but Chipotl-away [a couple of squirts of it makes the liquid vanish] makes your underwear clean [a towel is used to remove the liquid and product] and ready for more. [a man is shown stocking up on briefs, but they slip from his arms] Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle. That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new. [a pair of black hands smooths some briefs out over a table, then puts the Chipotle burrito on it] Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it."
1657,13,8,Man 2,"[leans down towards the burrito and smiles at the camera] Mmm, Chipotle. [gives a thumbs up and begins to eat off his underwear]"
1658,13,8,Billy Mays,"Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want [two women eat burritos on a park bench.], and still have underwear that sparkles and shines [one of the women holds up a pair of clean panties, which sparkle and shine]. Order right now!"
1659,13,8,Eric Cartman,That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
1660,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?! Are you serious?!
1661,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can."
1662,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!"
1663,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Because he was a great person, Kyle."
1664,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!"
1665,13,8,Eric Cartman,"...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call..."
1666,13,8,Announcer,"On this episode of Ghost Hunters [a cemetery is shown]: a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities. [a shot of Ike floating across the screen, with various backdrops behind him] Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!"
1667,13,8,Jason,"Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris."
1668,13,8,Kris,We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-
1669,13,8,Jason,"Wait, what? What was that? What was that?"
1670,13,8,Grant,"I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*"
1671,13,8,Jason,Is there a ghost here?
1672,13,8,Jason,"Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?"
1673,13,8,Kris,"Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them."
1674,13,8,Jason,"Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?"
1675,13,8,Grant,I think that's just a cigarette lighter.
1676,13,8,Jason,"Oh, right, okay. May be."
1677,13,8,Jason,We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that?
1678,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,What was what?
1679,13,8,Jason,Did you hear that? It was like a... it was like a... dee.. Is there a spooky ghost here?? Uh LOOK. What is that? What is that?? [a shot of the Broflovskis living room TV]
1680,13,8,Grant,I'm pretty sure that's their television.
1681,13,8,Jason,"Oh man I am really scared. [looks at his groin. Grant's flashlight and the camera quickly aim at it] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What is this? What is this? There's a, there's a, a wetness coming from my pants! [he peed his pants]"
1682,13,8,Grant,I see it!
1683,13,8,Jason,W... what is it?!
1684,13,8,Grant,Oh God I'm so scared! [begins to whimper] I'm so scared.
1685,13,8,Jason,"Look! Look, it's got you too! [points to Grant's groin, then says to the cameraman] Are you getting this? Make sure the camera is getting this. Definitely some paranormal activity!"
1686,13,8,Grant,"It's warm, and moist. A warm moist sensation that's moving down my left thigh. [the urine reaches the floor and starts spreading out]"
1687,13,8,Jason,"Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??"
1688,13,8,Stan Marsh,Are you guys fucking serious?
1689,13,8,Jason,"Oh God, the paranormal activity is now leaving a, a trail of some kind behind both of us! [such melodrama!]"
1690,13,8,Grant,"Hoh! Something... hot, and and, warm is coming out the back of my pants now. [Well...]"
1691,13,8,Jason,Oh it smells!
1692,13,8,"TAPS (Jason, Grant, Kris, and another member)",AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
1693,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
1694,13,8,Billy Mays,"[his ghost suddenly appears with a new pitch] Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station."
1695,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's all just in your head, Ike."
1696,13,8,Billy Mays,The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders
1697,13,8,Ike Broflovski,AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!! [the other boys look at each other]
1698,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,I just... don't understand it.
1699,13,8,Stan Marsh,"It's gonna be alright, Kyle."
1700,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?"
1701,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter."
1702,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear. [to Stan] Do you understand this?"
1703,13,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood."
1704,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway."
1705,13,8,Dr Carroll,"Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma."
1706,13,8,Stan Marsh,"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?"
1707,13,8,Dr Carroll,"Well of course there really are ghosts. Haven't you seen that show Ghost Hunters? But I'm a pediatric doctor, so I'm going to hand this off to Dr. Phillips, who specializes in spooky things. [Dr. Phillips, a female, walks in and addresses the boys]"
1708,13,8,Dr Phillips,"The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it. [Stan and Kyle look at each other as Dr. Carroll walks away] I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory."
1709,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,Purgatory? What's that?
1710,13,8,Dr Phillips,"[steps closer to the boys] Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called ""purgatory."" It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo."
1711,13,8,Eric Cartman,[concerned] Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
1712,13,8,Dr Phillips,"I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known. [the needles on an Ectograph 500 begin to move back and forth, producing some readings]"
1713,13,8,Billy Mays,"[only his voice is heard] Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product."
1714,13,8,Eric Cartman,Billy Mays! [makes his way to the front of the group] It's him!
1715,13,8,Billy Mays,Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?

1768,13,8,Eric Cartman,[rolls his eyes up in thought] Was I alarmed? [closes his eyes] Yes. [opens them and looks at Kyle] I believe I was.
1769,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
1770,13,8,Eric Cartman,"[correcting him] Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. [Kyle's jaw drops in alarm]"

1772,13,8,Eric Cartman,Yes!
1773,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,"And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?"
1774,13,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal! [Kyle puts his hands down below the table] People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! [points to Stan]"
1775,13,8,Stan Marsh,Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
1776,13,8,Kyle Broflovski,What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?

[smiles, but that turns into surprise when she whips out her wad of bills and adds the five dollar bill to it. She puts the wad back away]"
1886,13,9,Sally Darson,"All right, you ready? [she turns to face him and puckers up. He looks at her and leans in, closing his eyes. She does not close hers. They kiss on the lips. They then separate and Butters isn't sure what to make of it]"
1887,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Thank you! [turns right and walks back to the playground. As he approaches the boys, he raises his arms up and smiles]"

1892,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[thinking to himself] Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now. [frowns, thinking of what being a man entails] Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money. [aloud, smiling] Hey, I know."
1893,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!"
1894,13,9,Scott Malkinson,[with a lisp] She'll kiss anybody?
1895,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!"
1896,13,9,Scott Malkinson,Wow. [turns and walks away] It's almost like having someone care about you. [walks back towards the playground]
1897,13,9,Sally Darson,"Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again."
1898,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[taking his cut] Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money."
1899,13,9,Sally Darson,"Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class."
1900,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Aww nuts! [walks off a bit] Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?"
1901,13,9,Sally Darson,What?
1902,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together."
1903,13,9,Sally Darson,"[walks up to him] Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding."
1904,13,9,Butters Stotch,We could have our very own... [puts out his hands and frames an imaginary plaque] kissin' company.
1905,13,9,Butters Stotch,"The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?"
1906,13,9,Sally Darson,"Wow, that's a great idea, Butters."
1907,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice."
1908,13,9,Megan,"[a third grader, taking notes] Got it."
1909,13,9,Butters Stotch,"I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets [puts up a smiling sun sticker on Sally's row on the work schedule] a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud."
1910,13,9,Sally Darson,This is gonna be great!
1911,13,9,Murphy,"Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible ""prostitution company"" starting up in South Park."
1912,13,9,Chief Yates,"What?! [grabs the report and leafs through it] Hohoo, not in my county!"
1913,13,9,Murphy,"We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from."
1914,13,9,Chief Yates,[walks off a bit] So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
1915,13,9,Murphy,"Sting operation, sir?"
1916,13,9,Chief Yates,"[turns to face his men] We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!"
1917,13,9,Chief Yates,"Hey baby, you looking for a party?"
1918,13,9,Driver 2,Ha... how much are you charging?
1919,13,9,Chief Yates,"Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra."
1920,13,9,Driver 2,Aww- get in. [Yates gets in and the car takes off]
1921,13,9,Chief Yates,"Right here's good, sexy. [the driver stops the car] Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex."
1922,13,9,Driver 2,"Ok-okay. [grabs his wallet, pulls out a twenty, and hands it to Yates]"
1923,13,9,Chief Yates,"All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants. [the driver unzips his pants] All right! Here we go. [leans down unto the driver's genitals and starting giving him head]"
1924,13,9,Driver 2,"Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick."
1925,13,9,Chief Yates,"Oh that's all right. [leans down to get something] Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE! [whips out his gun and badge, aiming the gun at the driver] You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!"
1926,13,9,Driver 2,Awhuh! What?!
1927,13,9,Chief Yates,"This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution. [grabs his walkie-talkie and talks into it] Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking."
1928,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
1929,13,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses."
1930,13,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Stacey Anderson?) [mumbles something more, pulls out his five dollar bill and walks away. Butters walks up to them from the other direction]"
1931,13,9,Butters Stotch,Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
1932,13,9,Stan Marsh,"Butters, you're the one doing all this?"
1933,13,9,Butters Stotch,Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. [pulls out his stack of bills and shows it off]
1934,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?"
1935,13,9,Butters Stotch,"I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees."
1936,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! [slams his locker door shut and walks off with the other three boys]"
1937,13,9,Butters Stotch,...A pimp. Huh...
1938,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. [smiles]"
1939,13,9,Sally Darson,Oh. [smiles]
1940,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company."
1941,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[addressing the pimp] Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp."
1942,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),You? You be pimpin?
1943,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job."
1944,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game."
1945,13,9,Butters Stotch,What's the game?
1946,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your ""bottom bitch."" That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?"
1947,13,9,Butters Stotch,[taking notes] Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
1948,13,9,Pimp 2,"See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?"
1949,13,9,Butters Stotch,I know what you're saying.
1950,13,9,Pimp 2,"Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?"
1951,13,9,Butters Stotch,[getting pleased] Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
1952,13,9,Stephen Stotch,"There you are, Butters!"
1953,13,9,Butters Stotch,Hey Dad!
1954,13,9,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend? [Linda doesn't look pleased] Sally Darson?"
1955,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch. [walks past his parents and up the stairs, but stops for a moment and looks at them.] Do you know what I am saying? [they're left speechless as he continues up the stairs]"
1956,13,9,Driver 2,"I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?"
1957,13,9,Chief Yates,"No way! Let's just get to this, baby."
1958,13,9,Driver 2,Alright.
1959,13,9,Chief Yates,"So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?"
1960,13,9,Driver 2,"Sure, I have the money right here."
1961,13,9,Murphy,"[to the other officer] Remember, he's going to give us the code word to move in. Wait for the code word, ""stretch."""
1962,13,9,Officer,"Code word is ""stretch,"" copy?"
1963,13,9,Chief Yates,"Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down."
1964,13,9,Driver 2,"Oh, you feel good."
1965,13,9,Chief Yates,"Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are."
1966,13,9,Driver 2,Oh yes. That's great. [the car begins to move up and down]
1967,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, you like it?"
1968,13,9,Driver 2,"Oh, I love it!"
1969,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!"
1970,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!"
1971,13,9,Driver 2,Oh yeah! [the van's driver looks back to see if Murphy and the other officer are as shocked as he is] Oh yeah!
1972,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!"
1973,13,9,Chief Yates,Teach this little whore a lesson!
1974,13,9,Driver 2,Yeah! Yeah!
1975,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, that's right!"
1976,13,9,Driver 2,"Awww, awwwww, awwwwoh! [the john's car stops moving] Awh. [the john sounds out of breath] Oh, oh man! [a shot of the john and Yates putting their clothes back on] Thank you! That was great."
1977,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a... [leans into him] STRETCH."
1978,13,9,Murphy,"Uhhh, that, that's it. Move in! [the police van and car arrive quickly and the officers jump out]"
1979,13,9,Driver 2,Oh God! It's the police!
1980,13,9,Chief Yates,"[quickly whips out his badge and gun] Freeze! [takes the john out of the car and throws him against the hood] You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! [the other officers come in and cuff the john]"
1981,13,9,Driver 2,Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!
1982,13,9,Chief Yates,"A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street."
1983,13,9,Groundskeeper,[blows her whistle] That's it recess is over back to class.
1984,13,9,Kids,[disappointed] Aaaaaaah.
1985,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today."
1986,13,9,Ashley,"So wait, you're keeping all the money now?"
1987,13,9,Butters Stotch,"I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch [places his left hand on Sally's right shoulder], and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school! [walks away] Do you know what I am saying?"
1988,13,9,Mr Garrison,"Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess."
1989,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[sees an opportunity...] Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo."
1990,13,9,Bebe Stevens,[bothered] What?
1991,13,9,Butters Stotch,Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
1992,13,9,Bebe Stevens,[really bothered] What?!
1993,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch."
1994,13,9,Bebe Stevens,Shut up!
1995,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh, alright then. [copies some problems down, then looks at Wendy. Softly...] Hey Wendy. Wendy! [loudly] Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?"
1996,13,9,Wendy Testaburger,Leave me alone.
1997,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch."
1998,13,9,Stan Marsh,Butters. Dude!
1999,13,9,Butters Stotch,What?
2000,13,9,Stan Marsh,You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
2001,13,9,Butters Stotch,Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all. [turns to Wendy] Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
2002,13,9,Wendy Testaburger,Stan!
2003,13,9,Stan Marsh,"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!"
2004,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[whips out a bill] Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him."
2005,13,9,Clyde Donovan,Wow wee. [grabs the hundred]
2006,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we've created a monster."
2007,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work."
2008,13,9,Mr Garrison,"Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!"
2009,13,9,Butters Stotch,"All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!"
2010,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie? [she gives him a freebie] Ohwoah, [twirls around] whoopie! [walks away, leaving Annie at her new post. As he re-enters the playground, Kyle meets him]"
2011,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, I really think we should talk."
2012,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Sure, Kyle."
2013,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong."
2014,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there. [Kyle turns to see Stan, who's listening to Wendy over at the merry-go-round] He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges."
2015,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, what's happened to you?"
2016,13,9,Butters Stotch,"What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up! [storms off, but turns once more to ask] Do you know what I am saying?! [turns and continues walking towards the main building]"
2017,13,9,Frat Boy 1,"[from the third floor balcony] Alpha Tau Omega, woo!"
2018,13,9,Frat Boy 2,[walks by on the street and looks up] ATOs!
2019,13,9,Frat Boy 3,"Alright, ATOs, our little Kevin is twenty one today! [the other frat boys cheer] And so, Kevin, we would like to welcome you to manhood. Our gift to you. [a huge three-tiered cake is wheeled in and the music changes as Chief Yates jumps out of the cake. He begins to dance around]"
2020,13,9,Frat Boys,Eewwww!
2021,13,9,Singer,"Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me,
Calling me all the time like Blondie.
Check out my Chrissie behind,
It's fine all of the time.
Like sex on the beaches,
What else is in the teaches of peaches?
Huh, what?"
2022,13,9,Chief Yates,"Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya! [more moaning from the frats] Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE! [silence. Only the crickets are heard. Some minutes later the police swarm the frat house] Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom! [faces the frats] Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. [an officer hands him the bag, which he opens and places under his ass. He proceeds to crap into it, but when the bag is sealed, it's all white - it's all semen.]"
2023,13,9,Murphy,"Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?"
2024,13,9,Chief Yates,"What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community! [his cell phone rings] Oh, hold on, that's my daddy. [answers the phone] Hey Daddy."
2025,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"[at the other end of the line] Where you at, bitch? I need my bottom bitch right now."
2026,13,9,Chief Yates,"Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way."
2027,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?"
2028,13,9,Chief Yates,"Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. [limps away painfully]"
2029,13,9,Black Bitch,Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?
2030,13,9,White Bitch,He's an asshole.
2031,13,9,Black Bitch,"You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him."
2032,13,9,White Bitch,A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up. [takes a drag from her cigarette]
2033,13,9,Butters Stotch,And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. [looks up at her over his left shoulder]
2034,13,9,Charise,"Did I do good, Daddy?"
2035,13,9,Butters Stotch,"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another... [looks for the right cell to place the sticker on and finds it] sunshine sticker for you."
2036,13,9,Charise,"Thank you, Daddy. [kisses him on his head]"
2037,13,9,Butters Stotch,[gets excited] Mmmwhoa boy!
2038,13,9,Butters Stotch,"And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under."
2039,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),And exactly what kind of business are you running?
2040,13,9,Butters Stotch,It's a kissing company.
2041,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),And you're making a profit?
2042,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late. [puts his hand over the right side of his mouth and whispers so Charise doesn't hear] You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss."
2043,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),"[getting suspicious] Do you keep any record of the men getting these ""kisses""?"
2044,13,9,Butters Stotch,"'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris."
2045,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),Senator Morris?
2046,13,9,Butters Stotch,Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
2047,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),Where?
2048,13,9,Butters Stotch,In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
2049,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),"Alright, get out of here! [throws Butters' papers back at him]"
2050,13,9,Butters Stotch,Huh? Why?
2051,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),I'm not falling for it!
2052,13,9,Butters Stotch,But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
2053,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),[rises in anger] We aren't giving you anything; get out! [her boss walks up next to her]
2054,13,9,Boss (Mr. Daniels),"Mrs. Davis, is there some kind of problem?"
2055,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),Eh no sir.
2056,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. [Mr. Daniels' jaw drops, and Mrs. Davis looks at him]"
2057,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally."
2058,13,9,Sally Darson,Okay.
2059,13,9,Charise,"Ubup. Daddy, how come this ho get to be bottom bitch?"
2060,13,9,Sally Darson,What?
2061,13,9,Charise,"I make the most money for you Daddy, that means if anyone should be bottom bitch, it's me."
2062,13,9,Sally Darson,"[she and Charise face off] Hey, screw off, ho."
2063,13,9,Charise,"Fair is fair, ho."
2064,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[rushes in to keep the hos from fighting] Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!"
2065,13,9,Chief Yates,"[voice only] Excuse me! [comes through the door] Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?"
2066,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans."
2067,13,9,Chief Yates,"Well, I think that's about all I need to hear."
2068,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),[voice heard outside the window] Yolanda! [his car honks repeatedly] Yolanda!
2069,13,9,Butters Stotch,What's that?
2070,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),[pleading] Yolanda please! You gotta come back to me! I got nothin' without you!
2071,13,9,Chief Yates,"You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!"
2072,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"[on his feet] Yolanda, I looove you. I need you. Not as my bottom bitch. I want... [back on one knee] I want to marry you. [opens a small box in which rests an engagement ring. Yates looks moved by this display of affection]"
2073,13,9,Chief Yates,"It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now."
2074,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other."
2075,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"[crying gratefully] Thanks, pimp. You done changed the game, that's what you did. [offers the ring once more] Marry me Yolanda? We'll move to a little château in Switzerland and get away from all this."
2076,13,9,Chief Yates,Oh Keshawn! [runs to him and they hug and kiss for a long time]
2077,13,9,Butters Stotch,Wha? Awww.
2078,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),I love you so much.
2079,13,9,Chief Yates,"Babe, I love you too."
2080,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"So much, baby."
2081,13,9,Chief Yates,"Let's, uh, let's just be happy okay?"
2082,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"Promise, babe. Promise."
2083,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[moved to tears] Oh, oh. [feeling remorse] Oh jeez. [closes the front door softly]"
2084,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee. [the girls come and genuflect] Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!"
2085,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),Happy anniversary baby. [slips a diamond necklace on Yates' neck] Do you like 'em?
2086,13,9,Chief Yates,"I love 'em, darling."
2087,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),I wanted to get you something extra-special.
2088,13,9,Chief Yates,"[reaches down to get something] Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the... [whips out his gun and badge] FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!"
2089,13,10,John Cena,"Say that again, Edge! You think you're better than me?!"
2090,13,10,Edge,"Cena, your mouth has gotten you in trouble for the last time! I'm gonna shut it up for you!"
2091,13,10,Spectators,Oooooooooooooooooooooo!
2092,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Bust him up, Edge!"
2093,13,10,Obese Woman,Kick his ass! WOO!
2094,13,10,John Cena,"Oh yeah?! I've got somethin' else to tell you, Edge! I slept with Vanessa last night. [everyone boos. Vanessa, the one with the pink bra, is embarrassed and tries to hide her face]"
2095,13,10,Redneck 1,"[his vest has a tag that says ""Eddie"" on it] Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend?"
2096,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!"
2097,13,10,Stan Marsh,I'm having the best time!
2098,13,10,Edge,"[a huge image of himself is on a massive TV screen behind him] You cheated, and took my belt from me, and now I can't hardly get work wrestling! You took muh girl AND you took my job! [all gasp]"
2099,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,He took his job!
2100,13,10,Redneck 2,He took his jrrr?
2101,13,10,Redneck 3,"Took hid drrr! [Edge throws down the mic and prepares to attack Cena. Edge slaps Cena hard enough that Cena falls to the ground, then does a victory pose. The ladies begin to wrestle]"
2102,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, sweet! [the woman in black bra pulls on the other woman's arm using her right leg as leverage, then begins pummeling her. Cena throws Edge against the ropes]"
2103,13,10,Edge,"Whoa... [flies off the ropes and into Cena's clothesline, which sends him to the floor on his back.]"
2104,13,10,Butters Stotch,Yes! Yehhehehes!
2105,13,10,Eric Cartman,This is awesome!
2106,13,10,Eric Cartman,Dude! That was so badass!
2107,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wrestling is awesome!
2108,13,10,Stan Marsh,This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! [the other boys cheer this decision.]
2109,13,10,Eric Cartman,The fuck is this?!
2110,13,10,Stan Marsh,[a couple of seconds later] Why did they have us put on long underwear.
2111,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this."
2112,13,10,Butters Stotch,"Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense."
2113,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?"
2114,13,10,Eric Cartman,I did. I'm the Rad Russian. [affects a fake Russian accent] I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
2115,13,10,Coach Connors,[arriving] Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling.
2116,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Cool!
2117,13,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
2118,13,10,Butters Stotch,Let's do this!
2119,13,10,Eric Cartman,All right!
2120,13,10,Coach Connors,"Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?"
2121,13,10,Eric Cartman,The Rad Russian.
2122,13,10,Coach Connors,What?
2123,13,10,Eric Cartman,"You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!"
2124,13,10,Coach Connors,"Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees."
2125,13,10,Eric Cartman,Huh?
2126,13,10,Coach Connors,"Just, down on, down on the floor. [Cartman bends over a bit, unsure of how to do this, given his girth] Hands and knees. [the coach helps him out in getting into position.]"
2127,13,10,Eric Cartman,Okay...
2128,13,10,Coach Connors,Alright and now how about you. Your name is?
2129,13,10,Butters Stotch,Triceratops!
2130,13,10,Coach Connors,"Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position. [drapes Butters over Cartman] Here- we- go."
2131,13,10,Eric Cartman,The fuck is this?!
2132,13,10,Coach Connors,Now just reach around him here. Good.
2133,13,10,Eric Cartman,Dude! Dude! DUDE! [jumps to his feet] The fuck are you doing?!
2134,13,10,Coach Connors,Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!
2135,13,10,Eric Cartman,"That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!"
2136,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, what are you? A child molester?"
2137,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
2138,13,10,Coach Connors,"Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night!"
2139,13,10,The Boys,Yeah! [all smiles]
2140,13,10,Coach Connors,"Ugh. [the boys frown at this] The WWE is not wrassling! That's a bunch of fake bullcrap! How stupid are you! Real wrassling, boys, is this! [spreads his arms out to indicate the floor and their uniforms - practice, practice, practice]"
2141,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. [they all take off their headgear and walk away]"
2142,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked."
2143,13,10,Butters Stotch,"I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! [throws his headgear on the floor and walks away glaring back at the coach]"
2144,13,10,Coach Connors,Rrrgh!
2145,13,10,Eric Cartman,"The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap."
2146,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,Sounds good.
2147,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair."
2148,13,10,Butters Stotch,Okey doke.
2149,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
2150,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again."
2151,13,10,Butters Stotch,"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!"
2152,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright are you ready to try this, guys?"
2153,13,10,Stan Marsh,Yup.
2154,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright, let's start wrestlin'. [the boys take their starting positions]"
2155,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,I am gonna k-kick your ass!
2156,13,10,Eric Cartman,"You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! [Cartman slaps him hard, and Jimmy falls. Butters intervenes.]"
2157,13,10,Butters Stotch,"Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad."
2158,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste-[Jimmy sneaks up behind him with a folding chair and smashes it into the back of his head, making him fall forward] ah!"
2159,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,Your girlfriend is a whore!
2160,13,10,Eric Cartman,"[whispers aloud] Wait for it, wait for the whore line."
2161,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"[softly] Oh, I'm sorry."
2162,13,10,Token Black,"You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!"
2163,13,10,Stan Marsh,We'll see about that!
2164,13,10,Butters Stotch,Now hold on! I am stopping the fight! [Stan headbutts him] Eoh!
2165,13,10,Redneck 4,What's goin' on?
2166,13,10,Redneck 5,Apparently that crippled kid slept with that Russian kid's girlfriend.
2167,13,10,Redneck 4,Jeez they're so young.
2168,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!"
2169,13,10,Butters Stotch,"That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!"
2170,13,10,Stan Marsh,You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
2171,13,10,Eric Cartman,And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
2172,13,10,Stan Marsh,I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
2173,13,10,Redneck 6,"That kid was in 'Nam? Man, that's incredible!"
2174,13,10,Redneck 7,Good for you for serving your country!
2175,13,10,Redneck 8,"Guys, check this out! There's this little kid from the Congo, who was raised by panthers!"
2176,13,10,Redneck 9,Are you serious?
2177,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!"
2178,13,10,Token Black,I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
2179,13,10,Redneck 1,That kid in the hat is havin' sex with two different girls?
2180,13,10,Redneck 11,"Naw, that little kid from the Congo lied about one of them to try and get the kid in the hat in trouble with his wife."
2181,13,10,Redneck 12,They're married?
2182,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back"
2183,13,10,Eric Cartman,"I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!"
2184,13,10,Redneck 9,That Russian kid's got hepatitis?
2185,13,10,W.T.F. Announcer,"And here he comes now, the cold-blooded wrestler from Mexico, El Pollo Loco! [Kenny, dressed as a masked luchador, comes out to mariachi fanfare and sparklers. The spectators clap and cheer him on]"
2186,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?"
2187,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
2188,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!"
2189,13,10,Stan Marsh,You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
2190,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?"
2191,13,10,W.T.F. Announcer,"Uh oh, here she comes now! It's Bad Irene! [Cartman, dressed as a diva, walks out of the dressing room and towards the ring. The crowd hoots and hollers. She climbs right in and takes the mic from Stan's hand]"
2192,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now."
2193,13,10,Stan Marsh,What?!
2194,13,10,Redneck 13,No! No! What are you doing?! Stan the Man loves you!
2195,13,10,Redneck 14,Don't break his heart!
2196,13,10,Stan Marsh,"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!"
2197,13,10,Eric Cartman,It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. [the crowd boos and expresses its disapproval]
2198,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Irene, no! Why?"
2199,13,10,Eric Cartman,Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
2200,13,10,Redneck 15,"Whoa, did you hear that?"
2201,13,10,Redneck 16,Shh!
2202,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Irene, you said you loved me!"
2203,13,10,Eric Cartman,"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! [screams, runs up to Stan with a steel chair, and smashes him with it, knocking him down]"
2204,13,10,Spectators,Ohhhh! [Kyle runs up to Cartman and knocks him down with a flying kick] Ahhhh!
2205,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"I'm telling you guys, you've got to see this. These kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine."
2206,13,10,Redneck 13,"There's this one kid, he saw his father get murdered. And yesterday he finds the killer, and it's this other kid whose an ex-cop. Needless to say, he whupped his ass good."
2207,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Yup, and there's this little girl, she's actually addicted to gettin' abortions. Got pregnant by nearly every boy there."
2208,13,10,Redneck 17,You're shittin' me!
2209,13,10,Redneck 13,"No! We're telling you these kids are fucking crazy! You gotta check it out! [the wrestling coach is sitting nearby, stewing at the conversation]"
2210,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,You can watch 'em almost every afternoon. It's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen.
2211,13,10,Coach Connors,[rises from his seat and approaches the men at he bar] It isn't real! Don't you people understand that stuff isn't real?! None of it! How stupid are you?! [Skeeter and another bar patron look at each other]
2212,13,10,Redneck 13,"[strokes his chin thoughtfully] What do you mean, it ain't real?"
2213,13,10,Coach Connors,It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!
2214,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"[walks up to the coach] Mister, there's a little girl out there who's had fourteen abortions, an' she ain't even ten yet. But I guess that's just [holds up two fingers on each hand in a quote gesture] ""not real"" to you! [turns and walks back to the bar, saying under his breath] Son of a bitch."
2215,13,10,Coach Connors,Look look look! [whips out his iPhone to show them] THIS is wrestling. THIS. [two men are shown wrestling in Greco-Roman style. There's a lot of grunting in the match. The bar patrons watch the little screen for a few seconds]
2216,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Mister, you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar."
2217,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight."
2218,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
2219,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright you guys, let's bring it in. [the boys huddle and hold hands] I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?"
2220,13,10,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
2221,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Let's do this! One! Two!
2222,13,10,Boys,Backyard wrestling!
2223,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence."
2224,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!"
2225,13,10,Redneck 13,"Gee, I didn't know his parents did that."
2226,13,10,Redneck 18,Shhh.
2227,13,10,Principal Victoria,"I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary."
2228,13,10,Coach Connors,You're firing me? Why?!
2229,13,10,Principal Victoria,"The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. [shows him the South Park Gazette, which has the headline ""Kids Wrestle with Adult Issues""]"
2230,13,10,Coach Connors,"No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!"
2231,13,10,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds."
2232,13,10,Coach Connors,You can't fire me for what these kids do!
2233,13,10,Principal Victoria,That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
2234,13,10,Coach Connors,What do you mean?
2235,13,10,Principal Victoria,"[sighs] We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors."
2236,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
2237,13,10,Token Black,"Oh! Sure, that works."
2238,13,10,Eric Cartman,"[rushing in with a letter] You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!"
2239,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,What dude? [the other boys gather 'round]
2240,13,10,Eric Cartman,We just received a letter from the WWE.
2241,13,10,Stan Marsh,From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
2242,13,10,Butters Stotch,No way!
2243,13,10,Eric Cartman,"""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."""
2244,13,10,Stan Marsh,Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
2245,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. [Stan and Kyle begin chanting ""Omigod!"" repeatedly]"
2246,13,10,Stan Marsh,Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
2247,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God... Oh my God...
2248,13,10,Token Black,I can't believe it's him.
2249,13,10,Butters Stotch,I'm freaking out...
2250,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,[fans himself] Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
2251,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before."
2252,13,10,Stan Marsh,Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
2253,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number."
2254,13,10,Redneck 19,"Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues. [a chime sounds, indicating the start of the second act]"
2255,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back."
2256,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do. [an elderly fan holds up a sign: ""STOP RUNNING JUGGERNAUT""] And I, again, am alone. [Stan, Butters, and Token climb into the ring behind him]"
2257,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. [Kyle turns to see the other three boys]"
2258,13,10,Butters Stotch,Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
2259,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I'll fight anytime, anywhere!"
2260,13,10,Redneck 2,"He don't run from fights, just from responsibilities. [Token swings a chair into the back of Kyle's head, and Kyle falls to the floor]"
2261,13,10,Crowd,Oohhhhh! [Token begins to twist Kyle's arm] Boooooooo!
2262,13,10,Stan Marsh,"What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother. [Kenny climbs into the ring as El Pollo Loco] And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. [Kenny picks up the chair and swings it into Token, and Stan turns to see him]"
2263,13,10,W.T.F. Announcer,"It's El Pollo Loco! [a section full of Mexican fans hold up a Mexican flag and two banners: ""Viva El Pollo Loco"" and ""Me Gusta El Pollo Loco""]"
2264,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler."
2265,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown."
2266,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking."
2267,13,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, we've been talking.)"
2268,13,10,Eric Cartman,"And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again."
2269,13,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
2270,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy."
2271,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(Yep.)
2272,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,What are you talking about?
2273,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!"
2274,13,10,Stan Marsh,He's right.
2275,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2276,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token."
2277,13,10,Eric Cartman,Right?
2278,13,10,Stan Marsh,"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers."
2279,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them."
2280,13,10,Eric Cartman,"No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances."
2281,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(They're gonna hurt our chances.)
2282,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!"
2283,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,So what do we do?
2284,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)
2285,13,10,Eric Cartman,Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
2286,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts."
2287,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
2288,13,10,Eric Cartman,It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
2289,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Number seventeen step forward, please? [a man steps forward shielding his eyes from the glare of the spotlights] You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!"
2290,13,10,Number 17,"[gets into a slight crouch] You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-"
2291,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Thank you! Number twenty-four? [another man steps forth as Number 17 returns to his place] You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!"
2292,13,10,Number 24,"Your father! Your own father! [slaps himself four times] I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!"
2293,13,10,Eric Cartman,Thank you. [Number 24 returns to his place]
2294,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
2295,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(Mhm.)
2296,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah yeah, not bad."
2297,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again. [Number 37 steps forward] We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?"
2298,13,10,Number 37,"Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old. My father... he liked it too. Until he died. [stirring music begins to play] Sometimes I think it's 'cause of him I followed this dream. [breaks into song]

All my life, all I ever wanted was to
Beeeee a wrestler
Fiiiiighting in the ring
Winning that belt.
And so I dreamed every night that I was the
Uuuuundertaaker
Smaaaaashing skulls in
Breaking arms.
But I'm so worked up. This is something I can do.
Do I have what it takes inside?"
2299,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling."
2300,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this guy crushes."
2301,13,10,Coach Connors,"It isn't fair. All my hard work. [he's reading Saturday's Gazette, which has Vince McMahon's picture and name under the headline ""Wrestling Smackdown Brings WWE President""] I'm not going to take it anymore. [he throws the paper to the floor, gets up from the chair, and walks over to a mirror.] That wrestling show is in for a big surprise. [grabs his headgear and puts it on] I'm putting an end to this once and for all! [gets into a wrestling stance] Hyaaaaa!"
2302,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,[standing on a stool by the front window] He's here! Vince McMahon is here! [the other boys arrive. An assistant opens the back door and Vince steps out and surveys the front yard.]
2303,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Oowow, it's really him."
2304,13,10,Stan Marsh,"He's here, Ohh my God [Kyle hops off the stool and joins Stan in the chant] Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-"
2305,13,10,Eric Cartman,"[preparing to dress as Irene] Alright, places everyone."
2306,13,10,Eric Cartman,"[over the speakers] Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. [An opera box has been built to accommodate McMahon. It has four seats, and an usher takes McMahon and assistant to their seats. Vince has his own personal Playbill with ""WTF"" on the cover]"
2307,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?"
2308,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
2309,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?"
2310,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wait a minute. Who is that?
2311,13,10,Stan Marsh,"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. [Coach Connors sneaks up to the side of Cartman's house with a briefcase and puts his back up against the wall]"
2312,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!"
2313,13,10,Eric Cartman,My man can do whatever he wants.
2314,13,10,Coach Connors,"Stay calm, you know what you have to do."
2315,13,10,Eric Cartman,You're just gonna have to deal with that.
2316,13,10,Coach Connors,For the good of real wrassling. [quickly moves away and out of sight]
2317,13,10,Butters Stotch,"No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!"
2318,13,10,Eric Cartman,"My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic."
2319,13,10,Stan Marsh,"No, you can't possibly mean that-!"
2320,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!"
2321,13,10,Crowd,Awwwww!
2322,13,10,Butters Stotch,"There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!"
2323,13,10,Number 37,[leaps into view in yellow tights and red boots] Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?
2324,13,10,Redneck 21,He's alive!
2325,13,10,Eric Cartman,You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
2326,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,What do you thnk?
2327,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that."
2328,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,They are decent wrestlers. We'll see how they develop their through lines in the second act. [whips out some opera glasses and puts them on]
2329,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!"
2330,13,10,Butters Stotch,Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
2331,13,10,Guard,"[catching up to the coach] Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits"
2332,13,10,Butters Stotch,[after Jimmy says something] Are you sure?
2333,13,10,Coach Connors,Oh don't mind me. [puts down his briefcase] I was just about to- [quickly gets the guard to the ground and takes up the starting position of wrassling.]
2334,13,10,Guard,[seems to be enjoying all the moves and grunts the coach is making] Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?
2335,13,10,Eric Cartman,"O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!"
2336,13,10,Stan Marsh,"When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!"
2337,13,10,Butters Stotch,He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
2338,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Lies! These are all a bunch of lies! [back to the ring. Kenny has a bloody baby doll under his left arm. A fake umbilical cord is attached to it] Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!"
2339,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(I can keep the baby...)
2340,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw. [The coach picks up the RPGL, puts it on his shoulder, and takes aim] We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!"
2341,13,10,Coach Connors,"[while Cartman speaks] Only one shot. [moves his aim from the ring to the opera box] Maximum damage. [zooms in on McMahon] This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING! [fires the launcher and the rocket takes off. It goes towards the façade, but stops and drops harmlessly into the ring] NO! [Kenny picks it up. It comes back to life and takes off with him holding on. They go all over the place, but finally take off into the sky, where the grenade blows up and releases fireworks. Below, Mexican fans of El Pollo Loco hold up banners: ""Viva El Pollo Loco"" ""Me Gusta El Pollo Loco""]"
2342,13,10,Fan 1,"O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!"
2343,13,10,Fan 2,Bastardos! [Kenny's theme music comes up as the fireworks continue coming down. Vince and his assistant stand up and applaud the performance]
2344,13,10,Coach Connors,"[coming down the bleachers towards the ring] No! No, shut up! [steps into the ring] You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling! [performs some wrestling stances and grunts, but gets booed]"
2345,13,10,Redneck 22,We want some real wrestlers!
2346,13,10,Coach Connors,This is just a bunch of garbage! And you are all ruining the good name of wrassling! [the boos continue] Wrassling is from ancient Greece! It's in the Olympics!
2347,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,What the hell do you care?! Get off the wrestlin' mat! Boo!
2348,13,10,Coach Connors,Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!
2349,13,10,Crowd,[suddenly confused] Huh? What?
2350,13,10,Redneck 5,They took his job.
2351,13,10,Redneck 23,"I know. Sshh. [the crowd falls silent, waiting for his next words]"
2352,13,10,Coach Connors,"You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother."
2353,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Oh man, they took his job?"
2354,13,10,Redneck 13,They took hid-drr.
2355,13,10,Coach Connors,Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!
2356,13,10,Redneck 24,They took his dog!
2357,13,10,Redneck 25,They tok hid-drr!
2358,13,10,Redneck 5,Took hid-drrr!
2359,13,10,Coach Connors,"I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spent the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!"
2360,13,10,Redneck 26,They broke his jaw!
2361,13,10,Redneck 22,Theeyy broke his jaw!
2362,13,10,Redneck 27,Brk hij-jrr! [a rooster in a cage crows]
2363,13,10,Coach Connors,"So you see I have nothing left. Nothing! Not even the will to live. [He closes his eyes. The crowd takes it in, applauds, then gives him a standing ovation. He opens his eyes, surprised at the reaction. Flowers begin falling at his feet, and Vince McMahon steps into the ring to approach him]"
2364,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,"Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen."
2365,13,10,Coach Connors,What?
2366,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,Will you not join our wrestling organization? I promise to make you our leading act.
2367,13,10,Coach Connors,"You, you mean it?"
2368,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,Come! I want to get you in rehearsals right away! [leaves the ring with the coach]
2369,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2370,13,10,Stan Marsh,Dude.
2371,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey, what about us? Our show? [the coach is now grinning as the two men walk away]"
2372,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,"Sorry boys. You are decent wrestlers, but lack the raw wrestling talent this man has."
2373,13,10,The Boys,Aaaaah.
2374,13,10,Eric Cartman,"This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!"
2375,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
2376,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
2377,13,10,Stan Marsh,"What?? [three fights break out in the ring: Cartman vs. Kyle, Jimmy vs. Stan, and Token vs. Butters]"
2378,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!"
2379,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... [the fighting continues. The crowd gets bored of this unscripted fight]"
2380,13,10,Redneck 28,What the hell's this?
2381,13,10,Redneck 29,This is Goddamned fake!
2382,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Screw this, this is just stupid. [leaves his seat. Other spectators leave their seats as the boys continue to fight in the ring]"
2383,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!"
2384,13,10,Redneck 3,FAKE!
2385,13,10,Eric Cartman,Kenny! I'm-
2386,13,11,Trainer 1,"All right, everyone, welcome to the Dolphin Encounter here at the Denver Aquarium. [a woman behind him waves at everyone. Randy takes a picture of the trainers] My name is Chet and I'll be your guide and trainer as you meet these intelligent and truly magical creatures. [several dolphins swim in from another part of the pool] And here they come: this is Trigger and Dolly, uh there's Bubbles"
2387,13,11,Stan Marsh,[happily] Wow cool.
2388,13,11,Randy Marsh,"Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?"
2389,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, this is gonna be awesome."
2390,13,11,Chet and Trainer 2,If they come near you you can touch their back just no grabbing please. What whimsical creatures aren't they? All the dolphins you will be encountering today are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Now who would like to get a kiss from one?
2391,13,11,Girl,I would like to-
2392,13,11,Randy Marsh,[barging in] MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
2393,13,11,Trainer 1,"Uh all right, let's just uh, get you to put your hands, palms down, on the water. [a dolphin swims by] The- [a rumble is heard, and then gets louder]"
2394,13,11,Stan Marsh,What the hell is that? [the trainer turns around. A group of Japanese men in kimonos run towards the pool with harpoons in hand.]
2395,13,11,Chet and Trainer 2,"Oh no it's the Japanese! [The group jumps in and proceeds to stab every dolphin in there repeatedly until the dolphins bleed to death, then jumps out of the pool and runs back towards the way it came from.]"
2396,13,11,Japanese Man 1,(In Japanese Accent) Fuck youuu dofiiin!
2397,13,11,Japanese Man 2,(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you dofiiin! [they leave behind a pool of dead dolphins and bewildered guests. The girl begins to cry.]
2398,13,11,Guide,"These are our favorite animals here at the Atlanta Zoo. It's Dolly and Seymour. They are beluga whales. These whales live mostly in the Arctic region- [the Japanese men strike again, making everyone else run out of the area, breaking the wall with their harpoons. ]"
2399,13,11,Japanese Man 3,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, whaaales!"
2400,13,11,Trainer 3 (Baltimore Aquarium),"All right Jessica, now put your arms down like this. [little Jessica lifts her arms out and open] Great job, Jessica!"
2401,13,11,Japanese Man 4,"Fuck you, whaaale! [jumps onto the platform and harpoons the whale, then runs off without taking the harpoon]"
2402,13,11,Trainer 3 (Baltimore Aquarium),AAAAAAAA!
2403,13,11,Randy Marsh,[sigh] Hey pal. [sits by him] Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
2404,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Dad, why did they do that?"
2405,13,11,Randy Marsh,"Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt! [Stan moves his arms out of the way and looks at the shirt - a white ""I swam with the dolphins"" T-shirt with blood splattered on it.]  And you always have your neat picture. [hands Stan the framed picture on the nightstand, which Stan opens and looks at. It's of Stan and a dead dolphin, with the caption ""My New Friend!"" underneath]"
2406,13,11,Commentator 1,"Dan Dierdorf here, welcoming you to this great football matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins. We're all set for kickoff and- [the Japanese men strike again]"
2407,13,11,Commentator 2,Oh Dan it looks like Japanese people are now rushing onto the field. [the Japanese men stab and kill all the Dolphin players] This is not the kind of thing you want happening during kickoff. [the Japanese men run off]
2408,13,11,Japanese Man 5,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, dofiiin!"
2409,13,11,News Anchor,"Several whales and dolphins were again slaughtered by the Japanese today, this time at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom near San Francisco. [a shot of the Japanese killing the dolphins there] Aquariums had been experimenting with methods to keep the Japanese out, but so far nothing seems to stop them. When asked if all of Japan supported the slaughtering of whales and dolphins, the current Prime Minister of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama, had this to say"
2410,13,11,Prime Minister Hatoyama,"[clears his throat] (In Japanese Accent) Fuck you weiru [gives the finger with his right hand], anda fuck you dohfiiin! [gives the finger with his left hand]"
2411,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh."
2412,13,11,Stan Marsh,"[as Cartman finishes the chorus] Guys... guys... [Cartman turns off the mic] Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand."
2413,13,11,Eric Cartman,What do you mean? This song is sweet.
2414,13,11,Stan Marsh,"No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins."
2415,13,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, they've been doing that for a long time."
2416,13,11,Stan Marsh,"So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?"
2417,13,11,Kyle Broflovski,"What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are."
2418,13,11,Stan Marsh,"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!"
2419,13,11,Eric Cartman,"I'm not too busy, Stan."
2420,13,11,Stan Marsh,You're not?
2421,13,11,Eric Cartman,"No, I just don't care. At all."
2422,13,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, me neither.)"
2423,13,11,Stan Marsh,Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
2424,13,11,Eric Cartman,"[speaking into the mic] Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!"
2425,13,11,Stan Marsh,"You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! [turns and walks out the front door. The boys don't move for a few seconds, then Cartman launches back into ""Poker Face"".]"
2426,13,11,Eric Cartman,"I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree."
2427,13,11,Butters Stotch,Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
2428,13,11,Stan Marsh,"[lights up] Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?"
2429,13,11,Butters Stotch,"Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are."
2430,13,11,Stan Marsh,[turns to look at Butters] Really? [gets off his chair] People who are doing something?
2431,13,11,Butters Stotch,"I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers."
2432,13,11,Stan Marsh,[determined] Then that's where I belong.
2433,13,11,"Commentators, Announcers and Singer","The world is a vampire, sent to drain."
2434,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,"Yeah, we're badass."
2435,13,11,"Commentators, Announcers and Singer",Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
2436,13,11,Male Crew 1,"Any means necessary! We're not protesters, we're pirates! [""Whale Wars"" shows up onscreen]"
2437,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,"That's definitely a Japanese boat. [looks through his binoculars] Looks like they're whaling now. [sure enough, the Japanese, on the Herro Maru No. 3, are throwing harpoons at the whales. Random cries of ""Gojira"" come forth]"
2438,13,11,Japanese Sailor,"Fuck youuu, weiruu!"
2439,13,11,First Mate,"Oh my God, they're gonna kill those humpbacks!"
2440,13,11,Woman 1,We've gotta do something!
2441,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,Pull up next to them. The fight is on!
2442,13,11,Stan Marsh,Sweet! [the Sea Shepherd pulls up alongside the Herro Maru. The whalers gather at the railings and razz the Sea Shepherd]
2443,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,[taking his crew out to the deck] Are we ready to do this?
2444,13,11,Deadliest Catch Captain and Crew,Yeah!
2445,13,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
2446,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,Are we badasses?
2447,13,11,Deadliest Catch Captain and Crew,Yeah!
2448,13,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
2449,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,Are we badasses?
2450,13,11,Deadliest Catch Captain and Crew,Yeah!
2451,13,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
2452,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,"All right, so... what do we do? [the Japanese continue razzing them] Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?"
2453,13,11,Crewman,"[masked] Great idea, Captain!"
2454,13,11,Aussie Crewman,I'll start right now. [begins punching himself on the cheek]
2455,13,11,Woman 1,"""Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."""
2456,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,"Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?"
2457,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff."
2458,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,Why not?
2459,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!"
2460,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,"You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready? [the crewmen hold up sticks of something...] Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them! [they throw the sticks at the Herro Maru and hit it, leaving blotches in various places. One explodes next to two sailors, who just look at the mess it leaves]"
2461,13,11,Luke,"Haha, you stink now! Haha!"
2462,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Wait, that's it?"
2463,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,"Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one."
2464,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat."
2465,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,"Well no, that'd be illegal."
2466,13,11,Crewman 2,Yeah.
2467,13,11,Stan Marsh,[can't believe how toothless their threats are] I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
2468,13,11,Woman 1,I'm a pirate in a war.
2469,13,11,Stan Marsh,Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
2470,13,11,Captain Paul Watson,We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
2471,13,11,Luke,"The Japanese are scared of how hardcore we are. [a Japanese gunner prepares a large harpoon in a cannon and fires it off. It strikes the Shepherd's captain's head, goes through it, and pins him on the wall, killing him instantly. Blood comes out everywhere]"
2472,13,11,Woman 1,Paul! [the Japanese sailors cheer this small victory]
2473,13,11,Crewman,Paul?
2474,13,11,Crewman 2,What do we do?
2475,13,11,Woman 1,We don't have a captain!
2476,13,11,Crewman,"Oh my God, oh my God!"
2477,13,11,Woman 2,[masked] Maybe he's okay.
2478,13,11,Crewman 2,Oh my God.
2479,13,11,Luke,What did you do?
2480,13,11,Stan Marsh,"What you assholes acted like you were doing? [cries of ""ikaban"" come from the Herro Maru as it slowly sinks in the ocean and Japanese sailors jump off the ship]"
2481,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! [the crew pulls at the ropes, and the covers comes off the statue - it's Godzilla.]"
2482,13,11,The Marauding Japanese,Ohhhh Gojira! Gojira! [they turn and run away]
2483,13,11,Prime Minister Hatoyama,"Nippon no gaijin! [""Stranger to Japan!"" He looks at the paper again] Kuso, taberu na! [""Eat shit!"" Crumples up the paper and throws it down.]"
2484,13,11,Announcer,"And now, Larry King, live."
2485,13,11,Larry King,My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.
2486,13,11,Luke,"'Ey Jordan! I'm on Larry King, mate!"
2487,13,11,Larry King,"So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?"
2488,13,11,Stan Marsh,"No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales."
2489,13,11,Larry King,Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?
2490,13,11,Stan Marsh,"...No, I don't care about the show."
2491,13,11,Woman 2,We're pirates.
2492,13,11,Stan Marsh,I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
2493,13,11,Woman 2,I've got balls! [Stan looks at her a bit annoyed]
2494,13,11,Larry King,"Well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing, and of course, many that see problems with it. Joining us now is one of those people and... [goes into split screen, with another guest speaking via satellite] You say Stan's methods are unethical."
2495,13,11,Sid,"Larry, you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this. If you want a hit TV show you have to go through producers, directors, people that are in unions."
2496,13,11,Larry King,"But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama."
2497,13,11,Sid,"Yes, but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network."
2498,13,11,Stan Marsh,Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
2499,13,11,Larry King,"But their old captain, Paul Watson [a real-life photo of him is shown], was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause."
2500,13,11,Sid,"He yes, of course, everyone knows that Paul Watson was a smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility, but we must-"
2501,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Screw this, I gotta get back to work!"
2502,13,11,Announcer,"On this episode of Real Actual Whale Wars, Captain Marsh searches for the Japanese fleet, knowing they could be absolutely anywhere. [Stan is shown on the bridge planning their next move with Crewman 2]"
2503,13,11,Stan Marsh,Would you mind stepping back a little?
2504,13,11,Luke,"Captain! Captain, some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade! [the cameraman and boom mic operator take a few steps back]"
2505,13,11,Stan Marsh,"No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers."
2506,13,11,Luke,But they say you know them. [Cartman and Kenny walk through the door]
2507,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! [his sweater has ""SAVE THE WHALES"" on it, while Kenny's parka now has ""DOLPHIN LOVER"" on it]."
2508,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, no, NO."
2509,13,11,Eric Cartman,What dude?
2510,13,11,Stan Marsh,Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
2511,13,11,Eric Cartman,We always have.
2512,13,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, totally!)"
2513,13,11,Stan Marsh,I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
2514,13,11,Eric Cartman,That's not what we said.
2515,13,11,Stan Marsh,"You said ""Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"""
2516,13,11,Eric Cartman,We were talking about Wales the country.
2517,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!"
2518,13,11,Kenny McCormick,(I just want to be on TV.)
2519,13,11,Eric Cartman,[under his breath] Kenny! [to Stan] I deserve to be on TV.
2520,13,11,Crewman 2,"Captain! Captain, the Japanese have been spotted near buoy 24!"
2521,13,11,Stan Marsh,Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
2522,13,11,Eric Cartman,"[popping up in front of the camera] All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! [grins and pumps a fist]"
2523,13,11,Announcer,"[an aerial view of the Sea Shepherd is shown] Captain Marsh races his boat to the last known location of the Japanese whalers. If he doesn't get there in time, hundreds of dolphins or whales could die."
2524,13,11,Stan Marsh,"As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! [the Sea Shepherd lurches all of a sudden.]"
2525,13,11,Crewman 2,What the hell was that?!
2526,13,11,Crewman 3,We just got rammed.
2527,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!"
2528,13,11,Crewman 4,It's not the Japanese.
2529,13,11,Stan Marsh,What? [goes outside with the crew]
2530,13,11,Announcer,"On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show."
2531,13,11,DC Captain,"You think you're so cool, don'tcha?! You think you're big boat reality show on the block?! [goes to a cage and pulls out a crab from it] You're taking away men's livelihoods!"
2532,13,11,Stan Marsh,"What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales."
2533,13,11,DC Captain,"You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!"
2534,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!"
2535,13,11,DC Crewman,Your show is fuckin' gay!
2536,13,11,Stan Marsh,Screw this! Turn hard to port! [takes the wheel and starts turning left]
2537,13,11,Announcer,"But everywhere his reality show's boat turns, the crab fishing reality boat block its path. [the crab boat, being smaller and faster, blocks the Sea Shepherd's path quickly]"
2538,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, fuck you!"
2539,13,11,DC Captain,Fuck you!
2540,13,11,Announcer,"It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging. [Stan is in the captain's quarters, sitting behind a desk, his face buried in his arms] Captain Marsh's boat is dead in the water. He can't go after the Japanese, he can't help the whales or dolphins. Once again on Whale Wars, nothing is happening."
2541,13,11,Crewman 3,"[name: Benjamin Potts] It's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying."
2542,13,11,Eric Cartman,"[gets emotional] Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like [sniff], we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures."
2543,13,11,Kenny McCormick,(And they're all shot.) [cries]
2544,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Shhh, Kenny... [the camera zooms in on Kenny, who's got his face in his hands] Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he- [flashes an angry look at the camera] Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though. [The camera pulls back to its previous position] Yeah, keep it there. [Cartman resumes his tale] He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything."
2545,13,11,Kenny McCormick,(I would do anything!) [puts his face back in his hands and cries.]
2546,13,11,Announcer,The crab-fishing reality show was doing just fine. [the crewmen celebrate another great catch.]
2547,13,11,DC Crew,"Yeah! Woohoo! Alright! [Stan is again shown in the captain's quarters, his face still buried in his arms on the desk]"
2548,13,11,Announcer,"But for the Whale Wars crew, it appears the show is over. Until... a sound is heard. [whale sounds. Stan lifts his head up]"
2549,13,11,Stan Marsh,What was that? [moments later the crew goes on deck. Stan is with them]
2550,13,11,Benjamin Potts,"Captain, look!"
2551,13,11,The Crew,Wow. Whoa. [before them are a bunch of whales. One of them rams the crab fishing reality show boat]
2552,13,11,Woman 2,The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!
2553,13,11,Stan Marsh,It's like... they know. [two whales latch onto buoys at either end of a net and begin to haul away the crab fishing boat.]
2554,13,11,DC Crewmen,Hey. Heeey. Noo! Stop! [the Sea Shepherd crew begin to cheer and jump for joy]
2555,13,11,Stan Marsh,They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
2556,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. [small plane engines are now heard. Cartman, Stan, and the others begin to look around]"
2557,13,11,Japanese Pilot,Bonzaaaaaaaai! [flies his plane right into a whale and blows up]
2558,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ! [Everyone looks around as more planes come in and take out the whales surrounding the boat. Two whales take a dive to deeper water, but two planes follow them under and blow up. The whales' corpses float up onto the water's surface.] We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!"
2559,13,11,Woman 2,"Look out! [four Japanes planes crash into the boat and blow it and themselves up. Once the smoke clears, the ocean is shown, filled with debris and carcasses. The crew of the Sea Shepherd is dead... Except for Cartman, Stan, and Kenny, who swim towards a piece of wood.]"
2560,13,11,Stan Marsh,"[catching his breath] I, I can't, I can't believe it."
2561,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales. [the Japanese boats pulls up to the boys' location and stops.] Uh oh."
2562,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round."
2563,13,11,Stan Marsh,Will you stop that?
2564,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!"
2565,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!"
2566,13,11,Eric Cartman,"You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! [goes back to his song. Stan goes to the cell door and looks out]

I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
[a door opens somewhere and two prison guards walk towards the boys' cell]"
2567,13,11,Japanese Guard,"Itte kure 'Akihito-sama irashaimasu!' [""... 'Welcome, Lord Akihito'!"" The boys, not knowing Japanese, say nothing. The guards bow to the emperor]"
2568,13,11,Emperor Akihito,"So, you are the ones who have been-a sinking our boats!"
2569,13,11,Stan Marsh,You speak English.
2570,13,11,Emperor Akihito,"You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!"
2571,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?"
2572,13,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, can we go?)"
2573,13,11,Emperor Akihito,[steps closer to the door] Why have you done this? Why do you insist on-a making trouble for the Japanese?!
2574,13,11,Stan Marsh,Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
2575,13,11,Emperor Akihito,[turns his back on the boys] You think you have the right to tell us what is okay?! I have-a something to show you!
2576,13,11,Emperor Akihito,"This is Hiroshima. Over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. We built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened. [Cartman yawns, Stan punches him on the right shoulder]"
2577,13,11,Eric Cartman,What dude?
2578,13,11,Emperor Akihito,"At-a 8:15 a.m. the people of Hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all. [an atomic bomb is detonated] Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated. [footage of bomb victims appears] Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes! [Cartman snickers. The emperor turns, folds his arms over his chest, and glares at him]"
2579,13,11,Eric Cartman,Sorry. [clears his throat.] A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
2580,13,11,Emperor Akihito,"One hundred and forty thousand Japanese were killed by atom bomb. We have never recovered from the memory of that day. It is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible. This-a picture shows the prane that dropped the bomb. [shows it to the boys] It was called the Enora Gay. And it was frown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day. Dohfin, and Weiru! [the pilots are shown to be a dolphin and a whale. The emperor shakes with anger]"
2581,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Ummm, where did you get that picture?"
2582,13,11,Emperor Akihito,"The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!"
2583,13,11,Eric Cartman,So that's what this has all been about?
2584,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it wasn't actually and dolphin and a whale who bombed Hiroshima. It was the-"
2585,13,11,Eric Cartman,"Zzzzt zzzzsssht! [whispers aloud] Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out."
2586,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh, right. Look, I... I think I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?"
2587,13,11,Kyle Broflovski,Hello? Stan?
2588,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me."
2589,13,11,Stan Marsh,"Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth. [pulls out a manila envelope and walks to the Prime Minister's desk] Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers. [hands the envelope to the Prime Minister, who opens it and pulls out the ""unaltered"" photo. The Prime Minister and the officials crowd in to look at the photo.] A chicken and a cow."
2590,13,11,Emperor Akihito,Chicken and-a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!
2591,13,11,Prime Minister Hatoyama,Chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as-a scapegoat?! This is outrage! [pounds his desk]
2592,13,11,The Marauding Japanese,Fuck you cows!
2593,13,11,The Marauding Japanese,Teikara chickens!
2594,13,11,Randy Marsh,"[watches all this with Stan] Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us."
2595,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?"
2596,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day."
2597,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,This... is exactly what I needed.
2598,13,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Meee toooo.) [a second later and the roar of motorcycles is heard, making the boys jump up startled. They look around]"
2599,13,12,Stan Marsh,Aww! Not those guys again! [the boys leave the pond and head over to the source of the noise - a group of bikers idling at at intersection for no other reason than to revel in the sound of their own bikes' motors]
2600,13,12,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! [the bikers just cheer each other on, but the motors drown them out]"
2601,13,12,Stan Marsh,God! Shut up!
2602,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Piss off, you stupid assholes! [the bikers ride off]"
2603,13,12,Randy Marsh,Isn't this great food?
2604,13,12,Gerald Broflovski,You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
2605,13,12,Randy Marsh,"You know what's really interesting is that- [the bikers roar in and stop at a crosswalk at one end of the restaurant, which is called Café Monet, and rev their motors. After a few seconds they ride away] ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-"
2606,13,12,Father Maxi,On this gorgeous day we bring these two together for the most important ta- [the bikers roar in and slow down. The guests and the bride glare at the bikers as they roll slowly by]
2607,13,12,Lead Biker,Everybody's checking us out.
2608,13,12,Biker 2,"Yeah, they think we're pretty cool."
2609,13,12,Lead Biker,Hooo! We were definitely turnin' some heads out there.
2610,13,12,Biker 3,Yeah!
2611,13,12,Biker 2,"I was pullin' back on that throttle, and everybody was like, ""What is that?"""
2612,13,12,Biker 4,Fer sure!
2613,13,12,Biker 3,Yeah.
2614,13,12,Biker 5,"Hey- hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us."
2615,13,12,Lead Biker,"That's weird. [clears his throat and starts imitating a motorcycle engine. The other bikers follow suit, and a few of the patrons look at them] Oh yeah, that's better."
2616,13,12,Lead Biker,All right let's head out. [the others agree and begin to rev their voices as they board their bikes.]
2617,13,12,Eric Cartman,"[walking into view] Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes! [the bikers quiet down, turn off their motors, and look at him] You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right."
2618,13,12,Lead Biker,...What did you say?
2619,13,12,Eric Cartman,"You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?"
2620,13,12,Biker 6,"...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!"
2621,13,12,Biker 2,Yeah! [the bikers rev their voices again]
2622,13,12,Eric Cartman,"No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. [proceeds to walk past the line of bikes]"
2623,13,12,Biker 7,Thah- that little boy just called us fags.
2624,13,12,Biker 2,Like he didn't think we were cool.
2625,13,12,Biker 6,"But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?"
2626,13,12,Lead Biker,"'Course he's wrong! And anyway, nobody except that little freak would ever say something like it to our faces!"
2627,13,12,Other Bikers,Yeah! Let's ride! [they rev up their voices and their motors] Let's go! Rev 'em up! [they ride off]
2628,13,12,Ike Broflovski,Fags! [then closes his window]
2629,13,12,Biker 2,Did that kid just call us-?
2630,13,12,Lead Biker,"Ju-just ignore him! [as they ride, a car pulls up in front of them. Two kids in the back seat turn and make gestures to them. One of the boys makes a sign, then turns it around. Both kids hold it up. It says ""FAGS."" One of them mouths the word and the boys laugh.] God damn it, this is fucked up!"
2631,13,12,Biker 8,What's wrong with kids today? [revs his voice a little]
2632,13,12,Biker 4,It doesn't make any sense. They all called us fags.
2633,13,12,Biker 6,"How can they call us fags? I mean, listen to this? [revs his motor up]"
2634,13,12,Lead Biker,"I know, I know! Look, guys, I think I know what the problem is here."
2635,13,12,Biker 3,Really? You do?
2636,13,12,Biker 9,Whatwhat?
2637,13,12,Lead Biker,"Yeah, think about it, guys. You see all the things kids have today? I mean, with their Xboxes and surround-sound entertainment systems, kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time!"
2638,13,12,Biker 1,"Hey, that's right."
2639,13,12,Lead Biker,"That's all it is, guys. We just need to get a little louder, that's all. [revs up his voice and his bike, and the others follow suit.]"
2640,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
2641,13,12,Eric Cartman,But Cartman isn't letting up on him. [the bikers roll by and the boys stop playing]
2642,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, what the hell?! [the bikers roll by with a variety of musical instruments, a siren, and a rooster attached to their bikes, all of them making noise.]"
2643,13,12,Biker 6,Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!
2644,13,12,Stan Marsh,God damn it God damn it!
2645,13,12,Lead Biker,"Oh yeah, now we're turnin' some heads! [blows into one of the two horns on his handlebars]"
2646,13,12,Biker 2,Let's see 'em call us fags now!
2647,13,12,Stan Marsh,"All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it."
2648,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
2649,13,12,Eric Cartman,Agreed.
2650,13,12,Jimmy Valmer,"I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots."
2651,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can- [the bikers roll by on Stan's street, then Stan sighs when they're gone] ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all."
2652,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,Sounds good.
2653,13,12,Token Black,"Okay good, yeah."
2654,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Ni-nice, okay."
2655,13,12,Butters Stotch,What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
2656,13,12,Eric Cartman,What?
2657,13,12,Butters Stotch,"I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! ""Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!"" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!"
2658,13,12,Stan Marsh,"...That makes perfect sense, Butters."
2659,13,12,Butters Stotch,It does?
2660,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Yes, now get out of here."
2661,13,12,Butters Stotch,Okay. [walks out]
2662,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?"
2663,13,12,Eric Cartman,"I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats."
2664,13,12,Stan Marsh,[taking notes] Oh that's good.
2665,13,12,Eric Cartman,"[taking notes] Yeah, I think that'll be nice."
2666,13,12,Stan Marsh,But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
2667,13,12,Eric Cartman,"I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy."
2668,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!"
2669,13,12,All,Yeah!
2670,13,12,Lead Biker,Now that was a good breakfast.
2671,13,12,Biker 6,I'm full. [the bikers all rev their voices again and stand by their bikes...]
2672,13,12,Lead Biker,[sniffs] You guys smell that? Smells like that new famous bowl at KFC
2673,13,12,Biker 6,"Ohh, OHHH! Somebody took a shit on mah fuckin' Harley!"
2674,13,12,Biker 3,What?
2675,13,12,Biker 2,"Awwww, me too! I got shit all over my pants now! [another biker throws up on his Harley]"
2676,13,12,Biker 7,There's a little flag stuck in the shit!
2677,13,12,Biker 11,"[picks the flag off his Harley and reads it] ""You're fags."" You've gotta be kidding me!"
2678,13,12,Lead Biker,"Come on, we'll find the bastards who did this! [the bikers wipe the crap off their bikes, rev their voices and their bikes, hop on, and ride off. They stop at an intersection and look up at a billboard. It's a Harley-Davidson billboard, and on it is spray-painted ""FAGS GET OUT."" They cross the intersection and continue down the road, stopping again when three buildings next to each other have the same message spray-painted on them.]"
2679,13,12,Biker 12,This can't be happening. [they continue riding]
2680,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Really nice work, guys."
2681,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
2682,13,12,Big Gay Al,"And so I said to the guy, ""you really think I'm paying that much?"""
2683,13,12,Mr Slave,"Heheh, oh Jesus Christ. [both men stop and gasp at what they see: the same three buildings the bikers just passed, and the message spray-painted on it]"
2684,13,12,Big Gay Al,Oh my God. I thought we were past this.
2685,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, ""Fags get out."" Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-"
2686,13,12,Eric Cartman,That was us!
2687,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,...'Scuse me?
2688,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we did that!"
2689,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
2690,13,12,Kenny McCormick,Yeah!
2691,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
2692,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,"W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town."
2693,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?"
2694,13,12,Other Kids,"Yeah, uh huh, I do, yep. [the students begin to murmur]"
2695,13,12,Mr Mackey,"Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!"
2696,13,12,Stan Marsh,Gay people?
2697,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,We aren't talking about gay people.
2698,13,12,Mr Mackey,You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!
2699,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?"
2700,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, they think we meant gay fags."
2701,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag."
2702,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!"
2703,13,12,Stan Marsh,Aw crap!
2704,13,12,Lead Biker,"Faggot, often shortened to fag, has been used in the English language since the late sixteenth century. Its original meaning was ""an old or unpleasant woman""."
2705,13,12,Biker 2,That certainly don't apply to us.
2706,13,12,Lead Biker,"Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks. And in the nineteenth century, a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood."
2707,13,12,Biker 6,"Well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks; there's got to be more! [begins revving his voice. The other bikers begin revving theirs, and the librarian shushes them. The bikers tone down their revving.]"
2708,13,12,Biker 2,What's that part say there?
2709,13,12,Lead Biker,"Later, the term ""fag"" was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried, and was often used as an insult to the elderly, as in calling them ""baggage""."
2710,13,12,Biker 2,"Fag was used as an insult to women, then poor people, then old people?"
2711,13,12,Lead Biker,In the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the United States.
2712,13,12,Biker 1,"Well that word just keeps changing its meaning. What's it got to do with us? [begins revving his voice. The other bikers begin revving theirs, and the librarian shushes them again. The bikers tone down their revving.]"
2713,13,12,Judge 1,We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?
2714,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,[exasperated] Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
2715,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay."
2716,13,12,Judge 2,"I happen to be gay, boys. Do you think I'm a fag?"
2717,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?"
2718,13,12,Judge 2,No.
2719,13,12,Stan Marsh,Then you're not a fag.
2720,13,12,Judge 1,So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?
2721,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?"
2722,13,12,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
2723,13,12,Kenny McCormick,(This is fucking ridiculous.)
2724,13,12,Stan Marsh,"All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?"
2725,13,12,Judge 3,"""Fag."""
2726,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Right. But you're not thinkin' ""Oh, he's a homosexual,"" you're thinkin' ""Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."""
2727,13,12,Judge 1,"This, this is, making insanely good sense to me."
2728,13,12,Judge 4,"Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?"
2729,13,12,Eric Cartman,"You call them ""bike-curious""."
2730,13,12,Judge 1,"""Bike-cu-"""
2731,13,12,Stan Marsh,"""Bike-curious""! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!"
2732,13,12,Kenny McCormick,[puts his head in his hands out of frustration] (Jesus fucking Christ!)
2733,13,12,Big Gay Al,"Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words ""fag"" and ""faggot"" are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!"
2734,13,12,Mr Slave,[clapping] Hear hear!
2735,13,12,Big Gay Al,"We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!"
2736,13,12,Mr Slave,Yeth Jethuth yeth!
2737,13,12,Announcer,This is Channel 4 Evening News.
2738,13,12,News Anchor,"A new movement in South Park is bringing to question the word ""fag"". Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago."
2739,13,12,Field Reporter,"And what is your name, little boy?"
2740,13,12,Martin,Martin.
2741,13,12,Field Reporter,"Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the ""fag"" for me? [shows him a poster with two pictures on it - one of a biker, the other of of a man dressed in women's swimwear. The boy is unsure what to do] Point to which one is the fag. [Martin finally steps up and points to the biker. The next clip is of the reporter asking a baby] All right now could you just point to the fag for me, little girl? Which one is a faggot? [holds up another poster with two different pictures on it - one of a biker, another of Liberace. The baby starts to lean to one side, and her mom moves her in that direction until the baby points to the biker.]"
2742,13,12,News Anchor,"[shown are the Mayor and her aides, and Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave] Sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group, the Mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word ""fag"" officially refer to annoying inconsiderate Harley riders. [next she's shown in front of City Hall with an aide and the four boys]"
2743,13,12,Field Reporter,[interviewing the bikers] How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?
2744,13,12,Lead Biker,What did you say?
2745,13,12,Field Reporter,"Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag."
2746,13,12,Lead Biker,"Hey you know what? If you call me fag in my face one more time, you'd better-"
2747,13,12,Field Reporter,I already did it twice.
2748,13,12,Lead Biker,"Well I think that- I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again."
2749,13,12,Field Reporter,I bet I do.
2750,13,12,Lead Biker,"Well okay, I-"
2751,13,12,Field Reporter,"Fag. [the lead biker throws a punch, knocking the reporter down and cutting off the video feed]"
2752,13,12,News Anchor,[Randy is shown watering his lawn] As more people in South Park adapt to the new meaning... [the bikers roll down Randy's street. He turns to see them]
2753,13,12,Randy Marsh,"Fags! [turns back to water his lawn. The bikers look at him and move on. Next, Father Maxi is shown holding a sign in front of his church: ""GOD HATES FAGS"" as the bikers pass by]"
2754,13,12,News Anchor,...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.
2755,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. [Kenny gets the ball and throws it to Stan, who dribbles it a bit and gets ready to shoot]"
2756,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days."
2757,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
2758,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,[runs up to the boys] You four turd balls in my office NOW!
2759,13,12,Stan Marsh,Aw crap! [drops the basketball]
2760,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,You have got me in a lot of trouble! [turns on the TV]
2761,13,12,Another Mayor,"The fact of the matter is that ""fag"" is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals, and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not! The town of South Park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world!"
2762,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
2763,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We're sorry, Mayor."
2764,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!"
2765,13,12,Stan Marsh,We can fix this!
2766,13,12,Mayor McDaniels,HOW?!
2767,13,12,Stan Marsh,"That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition."
2768,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country."
2769,13,12,Lead Biker,"Now I don't know about you, but I think this town is starting a trend. And if we let them officially change the meaning of ""fag"" from gay people to us, then soon every town might. [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes] If we don't do anythng, we can end up trying to fight e- [one biker continues to rev up his voice and bike] If we don't do anything, we c-... Hey Bartlett. Bartlett! [stands in front of him] I'm trying to talk, you fag! [Bartlett is stunned, as are the other bikers] Aw, see? Now they got us doin' it to ourselves! We gotta put a stop to this now! [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes] We're going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin' ass! [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes]"
2770,13,12,Field Reporter,"Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word ""fag"" will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, ""fag"" will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide."
2771,13,12,Big Gay Al,"You can do it, boys! We believe in you!"
2772,13,12,Field Reporter,"And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived. [three officials walk up the red carpet, one of them holding the dictionary on its own pillow.] Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis. [shown in a gown following the three men]"
2773,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Emmanuel Lewis, huh?"
2774,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Ohh, it all makes sense now. [the four men walk onto the right side of the stage. The crowd cheers and claps]"
2775,13,12,Emmanuel Lewis,"To change... [the crowd falls silent] the definition of a word... is no trifling thing. I expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word ""fag"" to be both discerning and undisputable."
2776,13,12,Big Gay Al,"Come on boys, you can do it! [motorcycle engines are heard. A horde of bikers roars towards City Hall. Randy gets up and sounds the alarm]"
2777,13,12,Randy Marsh,"Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! [everyone scatters as the bikers arrive and tear everything up. One of them throws a bottle bomb at a store, breaking a window and setting it on fire. A family nearby escapes injury. Three bikers ram their motorcycles into the stage]"
2778,13,12,Stan Marsh,There's fags everywhere!
2779,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We gotta run! [the boys leave the stage quickly. A biker throws his chain towards the stage, catching Emmanuel Lewis by the right ankle and pulling him off the stage and down the street.]"
2780,13,12,Emmanuel Lewis,"WAAAH! What nefariousness is this?! Ogh! You obdurate beast! [as the town falls into chaos, the boys run into an alley, but find that it has a dead end. The bikers gather at the alley's entrance and the lead biker walks up to the boys. The other bikers get off their Harleys and follow]"
2781,13,12,Lead Biker,"[stops] Well well. Now, do you think we're fags?"
2782,13,12,Stan Marsh,"[backing up as far as he can] Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. [the other boys do as well]"
2783,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. You definitely made your point.
2784,13,12,Biker 13,"No! We rolled in, kicked ass, and took shit over! Is that what a fag does?!"
2785,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does."
2786,13,12,Lead Biker,"No, you're supposed to think we're not fags now!"
2787,13,12,Stan Marsh,But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
2788,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,I don't either.
2789,13,12,Butters Stotch,"[voice only] That's because you guys never understood! [walks through the crowd of bikers and past the lead biker] You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom."
2790,13,12,Biker 14,Who is this little fag?
2791,13,12,Butters Stotch,"I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious."
2792,13,12,Biker 15,"That's it, let's kill them all!"
2793,13,12,Eric Cartman,No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
2794,13,12,Big Gay Al,"[voice only] No one is killing anyone! [a sound of guns being cocked. The bikers turn to see who's at the alley entrance - Big Gay Al and his gay support group. One group member holds a sign - ""GAYS AGAINST FAGS""] We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!"
2795,13,12,Lead Biker,"[seeing no choice but to accept the word] All right everyone, all right. We are fags. Yeah, we're fags. We're total fags. And yo know what? We like it."
2796,13,12,Biker 2,"Yeah, we like being fags."
2797,13,12,Lead Biker,"So go ahead, America. Whenever you pass by Harley riders like us, roll down your window, and yell ""Faggots!"" All you kids out there, when you see us, walk up to us, and say ""Hello, fags."" No, really, we want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are. Right guys?"
2798,13,12,"A Bunch of Harley Riders, or Bikers","That's right. You got it. Yeah. [more of this, followed by revving voices and motors]"
2799,13,12,Biker 6,"Come on, fags, let's roll out! [the bikers ride away. Emmanuel Lewis limps back onto the stage]"
2800,13,12,Stan Marsh,"...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags."
2801,13,12,Emmanuel Lewis,"Let there be no perplexity: those individuals are the legitimate faggots. The definition shall be replaced. [everyone in town, even the homosexuals, cheer this change]"
2802,13,12,Stan Marsh,We did it! Yeah!
2803,13,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! We did it, you guys! [he and Stan hug]"
2804,13,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh it's over, it's finally over! [he and Kenny do a shoulder embrace. Stan walks up to the camera]"
2805,13,12,Stan Marsh,"Today, we've made history."
2806,13,13,Student,"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements, Parent-teacher conferences begin next Thursday. If you have not yet done so, please turn in your parents' requested time sheets by the end of fifth period today. [Kindergarten class is shown, with a female teacher] Lunch today will be a choice of chicken tostadas or spaghetti with a marninara sauce and side salad. [Fourth grade class is shown again.] Attention fourth graders: the fall registration for glee club starts tomorrow. Any interested students should fill out a- [a door is heard being kicked in] Whoa, what's going on?"
2807,13,13,Intruder,I'll killl you! [the class pays closer attention] I swear to God I'll kill you!
2808,13,13,Student,Who are you?!
2809,13,13,Intruder,I'm the man who's gonna put a bullet between your eyes!
2810,13,13,Student,Hey! He's got a gun!
2811,13,13,Intruder,You little bastard! You fucked my wife! You think I wouldn't find out?!
2812,13,13,Student,"Sir, please, I don't know you."
2813,13,13,Intruder,"Yeah, right!"
2814,13,13,Man,"All right, what the hell is going on around here? You sir need to leave this area- [two gun shots are heard and the man is heard falling with a thud]"
2815,13,13,Student,"Oh God, he shot him!"
2816,13,13,Intruder,"Ya had to push me, didn't ya?! NOW YOU!"
2817,13,13,Student,"HAAAAAAAAAA! Sir, I truly don't know- [punch] th-AAAAA! AAAA!"
2818,13,13,Intruder,"There! How's it feel, huh?!"
2819,13,13,Student,"[shrieking] Please, I don't know you! Uughuh!"
2820,13,13,Intruder,"You're Gordon Stoltski, right?! Truck driver from Chicago?!"
2821,13,13,Gordon Stoltski,"No, I'm Gordon Stoltski, third grader who reads the morning announcements!"
2822,13,13,Intruder,"Yeah, right! We'll see if that's true. Go on, read the morning announcements!"
2823,13,13,Gordon Stoltski,SOMEBODY HELP ME!
2824,13,13,Intruder,I said do it! [smack]
2825,13,13,Gordon Stoltski,"AAAAA! AAAAA! AAAAAAAAAA! AAA! Any, any interested students should fill out an applicant survey [smack] WAA! WAAAAAAAAAA!"
2826,13,13,Intruder,I knew you were lyin'! That was terrible! Now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun!
2827,13,13,Gordon Stoltski,No please! I'm so scared!  [more softly] I'm so scared!
2828,13,13,Intruder,DO IT!
2829,13,13,Gordon Stoltski,"Please! I'll duh, I'll do whatever you say! Here! Here I see! Here! [his voice gets muffled] I got my mouth on the ba- [the gun goes off and Gordon falls on the floor]"
2830,13,13,Intruder,Look at you now. We're all dead. [shoots himself]
2831,13,13,Mr Mackey,"We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning."
2832,13,13,Eric Cartman,Oh. My. Goodddd.
2833,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?"
2834,13,13,Mike,"Yeah, I think it would be really fu-fu-fu-fun, and ru-ru-ru-rurrraise my self es-es-esesesteem."
2835,13,13,Mr Mackey,"[cracks the door open and looks out] Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. [Mike gets off the chair and enters the office.]"
2836,13,13,Eric Cartman,[cackles] He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag! [another boy walks up and sits in the chair to Cartman's right. Cartman notices immediately: the boy is well-dressed] Who are you?
2837,13,13,Casey Miller,"My name is Casey Miller, and I'm in the third grade. [Cartman is awed] Ever since I can remember people have told me I should read their morning announcements. My friends always said to me, ""Dear Casey, your voice is like butter to our ears. Could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves?"" Well, here I am, and hopefully I'll be the kid with the job. [Cartman is mad now and gives him a hard look]"
2838,13,13,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?"
2839,13,13,Casey Miller,I'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.
2840,13,13,Mr Mackey,"M'kay. Eric, you wanna go next? [Cartman gets off his chair and walks into the office, keeping his eyes on Casey until the door closes]"
2841,13,13,Mr Mackey,"M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper."
2842,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?"
2843,13,13,Mr Mackey,What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
2844,13,13,Eric Cartman,Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
2845,13,13,Mr Mackey,"Get lost, you little dirtball!"
2846,13,13,Casey Miller,Excuse me?
2847,13,13,Mr Mackey,I said take a hike!
2848,13,13,Casey Miller,I don't understand... what I did wrong.
2849,13,13,Mr Mackey,"Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! [Casey gets off his chair and walks away]"
2850,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well. [reads the next announcement] For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger! [Wendy's mouth drops open] Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia! [Clyde has gone to sleep, half the class is getting sleepy, Stan buries his head in his arms] It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners."
2851,13,13,Butters Stotch,Oh jeez!
2852,13,13,Eric Cartman,"But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!"
2853,13,13,Kyle Broflovski,Will somebody shut him up?
2854,13,13,Eric Cartman,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?"
2855,13,13,Principal Victoria,"The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do."
2856,13,13,Eric Cartman,Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
2857,13,13,Principal Victoria,"No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work."
2858,13,13,Eric Cartman,Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
2859,13,13,Mr Mackey,"Well, because he was being murdered."
2860,13,13,Eric Cartman,"You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!"
2861,13,13,Principal Victoria,All we ask is you keep it shorter.
2862,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!"
2863,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field. [The first or second grade class is shown] I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions. [next day] Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school- [next day] And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that."" [next day] I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school."
2864,13,13,Third Graders,I pledge allegiance to the flag -
2865,13,13,Eric Cartman,"- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -"
2866,13,13,Kindergartners,- a socialist dunghole...
2867,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class, [The lights go down and a monitor is shown above Mr. Garrison's desk] you will see that the announcements are now being done in video."
2868,13,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, no! [Cartman has made his own graphic introduction full of poses]"
2869,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again. [exhales forcefully] Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back. [leaves his desk and walks over to a mobile blackboard] So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs."
2870,13,13,Ike Broflovski,[upset to the fact] NOOO!
2871,13,13,Eric Cartman,"I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why [writes Y on the board], we're gonna transform into something."
2872,13,13,Butters Stotch,Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
2873,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,Is what true?
2874,13,13,Butters Stotch,That you hate Smurfs?
2875,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,I don't have time for this.
2876,13,13,Butters Stotch,Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
2877,13,13,Melvins,"Yeah, that's right. We can ask. [Casey is among them]"
2878,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
2879,13,13,Butters Stotch,[gasps and points] It is true!
2880,13,13,Melvin 1,Oh my God!
2881,13,13,Melvin 2,"Yeah, bemememe"
2882,13,13,Melvin 3,Oh my God!
2883,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! [storms off]"
2884,13,13,Butters Stotch,What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
2885,13,13,Casey Miller,Hyeah.
2886,13,13,Melvin 1,That was cool.
2887,13,13,Melvin 4,Awesome
2888,13,13,Melvin 2,"Yeah, that was cool."
2889,13,13,Melvin 3,"Yeah, great job."
2890,13,13,Eric Cartman,"""Thank you"" and this is to..?"
2891,13,13,Douglas,Douglas.
2892,13,13,Eric Cartman,"[signs a copy] ""To Douglas."" There you go. [gives it to him] Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy."
2893,13,13,Butters Stotch,Hey Eric!
2894,13,13,Eric Cartman,Well hello. Another person who [looks to his right and tries to get the other kids' attention as they stream into the cafeteria] cares about the future of our school?
2895,13,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?"
2896,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book."
2897,13,13,Butters Stotch,"Cool, thanks."
2898,13,13,Eric Cartman,That'll be five dollars.
2899,13,13,Butters Stotch,"[a bit disappointed] Oh, okay. [hands him a five-dollar bill]"
2900,13,13,Stan Marsh,What the hell do you think you're doing?!
2901,13,13,Eric Cartman,A book signing.
2902,13,13,Stan Marsh,I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
2903,13,13,Eric Cartman,I do not directly say she's a slut!
2904,13,13,Stan Marsh,"""Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end""!"
2905,13,13,Eric Cartman,"[leans over the table and points somethoug out to him] You didn't read the rest, dude."
2906,13,13,Stan Marsh,"""Or does she?"""
2907,13,13,Eric Cartman,"""Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!"
2908,13,13,Butters Stotch,"[shwoing up with his Melvins] Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!"
2909,13,13,Boy 1,"""Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?"" [the other boys react to that passage]"
2910,13,13,Stan Marsh,"Hey hey, stop reading that!"
2911,13,13,Boy 1,Wull what do you mean?
2912,13,13,Stan Marsh,"Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!"
2913,13,13,Boy 2,Yes it does!
2914,13,13,Casey Miller,Eric Cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders. We should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina. I'm Casey Miller. [Stan turns and walks away. He sees Wendy at her locker and approaches her.]
2915,13,13,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?"
2916,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"I really don't care, Stan."
2917,13,13,Stan Marsh,Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
2918,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! [takes up her backpack and storms off]"
2919,13,13,Eric Cartman,"You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?"
2920,13,13,Principal Victoria,"Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school."
2921,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?"
2922,13,13,Mr Mackey,"Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?"
2923,13,13,Eric Cartman,And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
2924,13,13,Mr Mackey,"Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-"
2925,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!"
2926,13,13,Principal Victoria,"[stands up] Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!"
2927,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! [turns and storms out of the office.]"
2928,13,13,Announcer,"[an adult male] Live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. Here, is Eric Cartman."
2929,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs. [an animated sequence begins. Smurf Village is shown] I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust. [one day he steps up, and they gather round him] It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. [they bring him a cap big enough to fit his head, he puts it on and grins. The camera pans up and the title of his animation appears: Dances with Smurfs]"
2930,13,13,Butters Stotch,Whoa... [this time Kyle is the one who has his head in his arms]
2931,13,13,Eric Cartman,"The smurfs and I grew to understand each other. [Cartman is now dressed as a Smurf, but only his face is painted blue. He's harvesting berries with the Smurfs] They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette. [He and the diminutive Smurfette sit on a log watching the sun set] We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion."
2932,13,13,Kyle Broflovski,"""These, are the morning announcements."" [Butters shushes him and he buries his face in his arms again.]"
2933,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Papa Smurf was displeased at first, [Cartman tries to catch up to Smurfette as her father takes her into their mushroom house] He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland."
2934,13,13,Cartman Smurf,"No! No, you must leave the noble Smurfs alone! Who's behind all this?! [gasps at the sight of lots of bulldozers ready to raze Smurfland, and at their forewoman] I should have known. Wendy!"
2935,13,13,Human Wendy,[just Cartman dressed as Wendy] Out of my way! [this Wendy has padding to make her appear to have breasts]
2936,13,13,Cartman Smurf,"Wendy, what are you doing here?!"
2937,13,13,Human Wendy,Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.
2938,13,13,Cartman Smurf,"Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!"
2939,13,13,Human Wendy,"Fuck the Smurfs! They can suck my fat tits! [she climbs onto one of the bulldozers, Cartman stands in front of it]"
2940,13,13,Cartman Smurf,"How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!"
2941,13,13,Human Wendy,"You can suck my fat tits too! [steps on the gas and the bulldozer begins to move. She rolls over the land, mowing down trees, mushroom houses, and smurfs, killing them by the tens. Blood and guts splatter everywhere]"
2942,13,13,Cartman Smurf,Smurfette noooo!
2943,13,13,Human Wendy,Suck mah fat tits!
2944,13,13,Eric Cartman,"And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs! [Butters sobs] Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD. [holds up the DVD case] The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?"
2945,13,13,Butters Stotch,That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
2946,13,13,A Melvin,I can no longer stand idly by.
2947,13,13,Butters Stotch,"We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!"
2948,13,13,Casey Miller,It is time for that slutty Smurf-killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.
2949,13,13,Melvins,Yeah!
2950,13,13,Butters Stotch,"I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it! [the Melvins cheer] So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! [the Melvins cheer again, and follow him out the side gate and on to Wendy's house]"
2951,13,13,Butters Stotch,Let us not forget what happens this day!
2952,13,13,A Melvin,Woo on!
2953,13,13,Butters Stotch,"We are here, Wendy Testaburger! [walks up to her front door, drops his pants and briefs, and pees on the front door.]"
2954,13,13,Melvin 2,"Take that, school president!"
2955,13,13,Melvin 3,Get her good!
2956,13,13,Butters Stotch,I am.
2957,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"[opens her window] Hey, what are you doing?"
2958,13,13,Butters Stotch,The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
2959,13,13,Mr Testaburger,[opens the front door and looks down] What the hell? [Butters stops peeing and looks up]
2960,13,13,Butters Stotch,"Wah! [turns and waddles down the steps without pulling his pants up, then across the front yard] Smurfkiller! [runs down the street with the other Melvins] Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!"
2961,13,13,Mr Testaburger,"Wendy, did a boy just pee on our door because the Smurfs were murdered? [Wendy plants her hands on her face, then removes them]"
2962,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it."
2963,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy."
2964,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house."
2965,13,13,Eric Cartman,People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
2966,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
2967,13,13,Eric Cartman,Of course. That's why we're here.
2968,13,13,A Boy,Five seconds. [the make-up people move out as Cartman stands up]
2969,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you. [sits down and gets his notes ready as the chimes come in] Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show."
2970,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,Sure.
2971,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it."
2972,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,Okay.
2973,13,13,Eric Cartman,"How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? [Wendy doesn't answer, and Cartman studies her reaction]"
2974,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"I don't, I, I have no idea what-"
2975,13,13,Eric Cartman,You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
2976,13,13,Butters Stotch,"Ohhh, he's got her now!"
2977,13,13,Eric Cartman,Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
2978,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-"
2979,13,13,Eric Cartman,"If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? [Wendy doesn't answer]"
2980,13,13,Butters Stotch,She's speechless!
2981,13,13,Eric Cartman,You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
2982,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option."
2983,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?"
2984,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?"
2985,13,13,Eric Cartman,What? What do you mean I know that?
2986,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?"
2987,13,13,Eric Cartman,No! You wiped them all out!
2988,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"[gets off her chair and walks around a bit] Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!"
2989,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Wait, hold on, can we take a break?"
2990,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that."
2991,13,13,Stan Marsh,What?!
2992,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president."
2993,13,13,Butters Stotch,All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
2994,13,13,A Melvin,I'm confused.
2995,13,13,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-"
2996,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs."
2997,13,13,Eric Cartman,"No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!"
2998,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay."
2999,13,13,Eric Cartman,You sold the movie rights to who?!
3000,13,13,Wendy Testaburger,James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
3001,13,13,Eric Cartman,Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
3002,13,13,Eric Cartman,[crossing the street] Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes! [turns around and rants at the theater] You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA! [gives the theater two middle fingers three times] You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! [gives the theater two middle fingers three more times]
3003,13,13,Eric Cartman,Huh!
3004,13,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?"
3005,13,13,Eric Cartman,"No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!"
3006,13,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want."
3007,13,13,Eric Cartman,I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! [the chimes come on]
3008,13,13,Casey Miller,"The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, ""Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy?"" Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake."
3009,13,13,Eric Cartman,"I'm doin' the best I can! [begins to cry, leaves his desk, and runs out of the classroom bawling.]"
3010,13,14,Eric Cartman,"We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park!
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like!
[Kyle flashes a look of anger at him]"
3011,13,14,Stan Marsh,"[annoyed] Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. [his father Randy is driving. The other boys present are Butters and Kenny]"
3012,13,14,Eric Cartman,"This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year."
3013,13,14,Butters Stotch,What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
3014,13,14,Eric Cartman,"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities."
3015,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"W-What are you talking about, Eric?"
3016,13,14,Eric Cartman,"You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off."
3017,13,14,Stan Marsh,We're here! It's the water park! [Randy pulls up at the front entrance and drops the boys off.]
3018,13,14,Randy Marsh,"I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4:00, you got it?"
3019,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Come on, let's go!"
3020,13,14,Stan Marsh,"We got it, Dad."
3021,13,14,Eric Cartman,"[hands the clerk some money] Six adorable children, please."
3022,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool! [finally gets to the wave pool, but gets pissed off] Oh, what the hell?! [the pool is quite crowded with people of all races enjoying themselves. The other five boys catch up to Cartman]"
3023,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?"
3024,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?"
3025,13,14,Eric Cartman,[with a stunned look on his face] Forget it! Just forget it! [walks off in anger. The other five are confused]
3026,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is awesome."
3027,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
3028,13,14,Butters Stotch,"[stops] Hey fellers, fellas hang on! I've gotta go to the bathroom. [Kenny continues across the pool without the other boys]"
3029,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, go ahead. [turns back to Stan and Jimmy]"
3030,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Okay, thanks. [goes to the bathroom right there, no stepping out of the pool or nothin']"
3031,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?"
3032,13,14,Stan Marsh,Okay.
3033,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, [glances back at Butters] check it out, I- [looks back again and sees what happened.] Butters, BUTTERS! What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!"
3034,13,14,Butters Stotch,"You said ""go ahead""."
3035,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat."
3036,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, Butters' pee is in there."
3037,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it."
3038,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do."
3039,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,No they don't!
3040,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they do, Kyle."
3041,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tu-tu-twenty five seconds ago."
3042,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Dude!
3043,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath."
3044,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,NO!
3045,13,14,Eric Cartman,"What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go oooooon.

There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.

There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!"
3046,13,14,Ride operator,Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
3047,13,14,Eric Cartman,Just do it in English!
3048,13,14,Eric Cartman,"There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park

(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park)."
3049,13,14,Stan Marsh,"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?"
3050,13,14,Butters Stotch,You bet!
3051,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not getting back in the water.
3052,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Aw come on, Kyle."
3053,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?"
3054,13,14,Stan Marsh,Not everybody pees in pools.
3055,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Do you pee in the pool?
3056,13,14,Stan Marsh,Not today... yet.
3057,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, come on!"
3058,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?"
3059,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Most likely.
3060,13,14,Eric Cartman,"[running up to the boys] You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!"
3061,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, where have you been?"
3062,13,14,Eric Cartman,I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
3063,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,So what?
3064,13,14,Eric Cartman,So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
3065,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well then they're not minorities, are they?"
3066,13,14,Eric Cartman,...What do you mean?
3067,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!"
3068,13,14,Eric Cartman,The black and brown people.
3069,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"No, you're the minority!"
3070,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!"
3071,13,14,Stan Marsh,This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
3072,13,14,Eric Cartman,Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
3073,13,14,Butters Stotch,The who?
3074,13,14,Eric Cartman,The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
3075,13,14,Stan Marsh,I'm gonna go on the slides.
3076,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Whoopie! [Stan, Butters, Jimmy, and Kenny take their leave]"
3077,13,14,Eric Cartman,"You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on! [only Kyle is left at the table, and Cartman remembers this and slowly turns to him] Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?"
3078,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Blow it out your ass, Cartman! [leaves the table without taking a bite from his hamburger. He walks by an elderly couple in a pool]"
3079,13,14,Elderly Woman,"Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?"
3080,13,14,Elderly Man,"Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything."
3081,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Eewww! [walks away quickly. Nearby, a man takes a water sample]"
3082,13,14,Water Tester,Oh my God.
3083,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi Pi. How can I heelp you."
3084,13,14,x Tester and His Assistant,"Pi Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park."
3085,13,14,Water Tester,I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now 98% pee.
3086,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?"
3087,13,14,x Tester and His Assistant,"Pi Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty three percent. [with some urgency] You have to shut down."
3088,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggest-a weekend. Everyone is having a-theh fun."
3089,13,14,Water Tester,"You're endangering people's lives! [shows him the test results] If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!"
3090,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?
3091,13,14,Water Tester,One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!
3092,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Gehntlemen, please-a. I come-a from ada Venice. [shows off a real life picture of a canal in Venice] Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee."
3093,13,14,Water Tester,You have to evacuate people now!
3094,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!
3095,13,14,Water Tester,"[now at the door with his assistant about to leave] If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. [they leave]"
3096,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!"
3097,13,14,Stan Marsh,"This is sweet, huh Kenny? [Kenny, who's facing away from the camera, doesn't say anything. A girl in an inner tube floats past the boys, then stops and lets loose some pee. Sure enough, the ground begins to rumble and shake.]"
3098,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"W-What's that? [Explosions of pee come out of every ride, overrunning them all. A huge pee wave rises over the park and swamps it, destroying every structure. An unlucky slider is swept down in a rush of pee. A woman loses her baby as the wave strikes her back. The pee tsunami sweeps across the Mt. Everest attraction. A statue of a man scaling the mountain falls off]"
3099,13,14,Man 1,It's pee! [turns to run from it]
3100,13,14,Man 2,"Look out for the pee! [Kyle, who's playing a Zombie Fighter video game, looks back to see what's all the commotion. The pee-nami hits the New York Splash attraction, mowing down its structures]"
3101,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Aaaaah! GROSS! [leaves the game and makes a run for it. A volcano blows up and chunks of lava drop all over the place. The wave pool gets unstable, threatening to throw people out with its wild waves]"
3102,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"[holding on to the sign post] Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! [the sign post breaks off and both man and post are swept away by the pee. Stan, Butters, and Jimmy climb up the Mr. Everest sign]"
3103,13,14,Floating Man,[swept away] Aaaah!
3104,13,14,Stan Marsh,"[in a shaky voice] Aaaah! [stops and looks at the pee, and sees a familiar boy floating in the water, face down] OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED KENNY!"
3105,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[running up some stairs in Drop Zone!!] Aw, sick! [the pee below him is rising]"
3106,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. [Randy quickly arrives in his station wagon and runs up to the captain]
3107,13,14,Randy Marsh,What's going on?
3108,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,I told you people to keep civilians back!
3109,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?"
3110,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-"
3111,13,14,Officer 1,"Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. [the water tester and his assistant walk into view]"
3112,13,14,Water Tester,"We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable."
3113,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,So this is all pee-related.
3114,13,14,Water Tester,"Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning."
3115,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,And?
3116,13,14,Water Tester,"It was almost all pee, no H."
3117,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God. I've gotta help him! [starts to run to the gate, but the captain catches him and pulls him back.]"
3118,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,Stay BACK!
3119,13,14,Randy Marsh,You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
3120,13,14,Officer 2,"Sir, it's possible with a crane we could help any survivors out."
3121,13,14,Water Tester,I think that would be a very bad idea.
3122,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,And why is that?
3123,13,14,Water Tester,"Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change."
3124,13,14,Fireman 1,Change how?
3125,13,14,Water Tester,"All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey. [a researcher wheels in a monkey who's been shackled to a dolly] We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. [unzips his pants and turns to face the monkey, then starts peeing on it. He first pees on the chest, no reaction. He moves the stream up to the monkey's face and the monkey begins to protest. The monkey tries to escape the pee stream, but the tester just keeps the stream on it as best he can.]"
3126,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,My God! He's become full of rage!
3127,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Aahhh...
3128,13,14,Stan Marsh,"[on a small plateau on the attraction] Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!"
3129,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,No way!
3130,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,"You've gotta swim over here, Kyle."
3131,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Come on, Kyle!"
3132,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's all pee!"
3133,13,14,Stan Marsh,Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
3134,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,I'll die if I do swim in it!
3135,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!"
3136,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
3137,13,14,Stan Marsh,"[hesitantly] ...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom."
3138,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,WHAT?
3139,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim."
3140,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
3141,13,14,Stan Marsh,Not... all the time.
3142,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,That is gross!!
3143,13,14,Stan Marsh,Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
3144,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! [the sign drops further into the yellow urine]"
3145,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, come on!"
3146,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, goddamnit! [climbs down the sign and into the pee. He holds his face high up as much as he can as he swims across] Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, [He climbs up and joins his friends on the plateau. He pants, dripping with pee]"
3147,13,14,Butters Stotch,Do you need to wash your hands?
3148,13,14,Eric Cartman,Help! Help!
3149,13,14,Man 1,"Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! [a branch hangs off a Floom Zoom boat]"
3150,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me! [grabs onto the branch and is hoisted onto the boat. He catches his breath] Oh, oh, oh. [sits up and looks around - it's all minorities in the boat]"
3151,13,14,Man 2,Are you okay?
3152,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you."
3153,13,14,Man 2,Well what are we gonna do now?
3154,13,14,Woman 1,We've gotta just wait it out.
3155,13,14,Woman 2,"Yeah, but for how long?"
3156,13,14,Man 3,We need to find somethin' to paddle with.
3157,13,14,Eric Cartman,"[pulls out a memo pad and pen and writes the following] Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live. [puts the pad and pen away somewhere...] Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. [the other survivors just look at him]"
3158,13,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying."
3159,13,14,Randy Marsh,"It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!"
3160,13,14,Sharon Marsh,What is all pee?
3161,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died."
3162,13,14,Sharon Marsh,What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!
3163,13,14,Randy Marsh,"I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants."
3164,13,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, you've got to do something!"
3165,13,14,Randy Marsh,"Calm down, Sharon, all right?! [shakes his head vigorously] Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors."
3166,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,[on the phone with someone] I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands! [hangs up] Damn it where is that antidote?!
3167,13,14,Researcher 1,"[with red hair] Here! Here! We think we have it, sir! [three researchers walk into view] It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine."
3168,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys! [three monkeys are wheeled in on dollies]"
3169,13,14,Water Tester,"Let's hope to Christ this works. [each researcher takes a monkey and injects it with the antidote. Then they start pissing on the monkeys, and the monkeys protest almost immediately] No, damn it, no!"
3170,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,They're still angry.
3171,13,14,Researcher 1,This one's really angry.
3172,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"It's out of control! [quickly takes a gun from a police officer and shoots the middle monkey first, then the one on the left, then the one on the right. All of them die.] Find an antidote that works! [the researchers leave]"
3173,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?"
3174,13,14,Stan Marsh,I don't know. [they hear the sobs of a crying man nearby]
3175,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Why? Why didn't Pi Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi Pi, but-a the Pi Pi not-a belieeve them. [sobs some more. The boys approach him]"
3176,13,14,Stan Marsh,Who are you?
3177,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"[stands up and faces them] Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee."
3178,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, well people should [looks at Stan and Butters] know that peeing in pools is [looks at Jimmy] bad!"
3179,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open the door then the pee can be lowered.
3180,13,14,Jimmy Valmer,Okay. W-where's the maintenance room?
3181,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? [Stan, Butters and Jimmy all look at Kyle, who looks back at them]"
3182,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,No!
3183,13,14,Butters Stotch,"You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle."
3184,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Not in pee!
3185,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"[grabs Kyle by the left wrist and pulls him away from his friends] Please-a you have to hurry! [lets go] I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower."
3186,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,[looks back at the other boys] Oh who pees in the shower?!
3187,13,14,Stan Marsh,"...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower."
3188,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee."
3189,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't pee in the shower, dude. That's fucking disgusting!"
3190,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!"
3191,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ!
3192,13,14,Eric Cartman,"It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... [imagines himself in class with a bunch of non-white students]"
3193,13,14,Teacher,"[A black man] All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report."
3194,13,14,Eric Cartman,"I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie."
3195,13,14,Teacher,Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
3196,13,14,Eric Cartman,...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
3197,13,14,Teacher,Good.
3198,13,14,Eric Cartman,Noooo... [now imagines himself at a job interview] Trying to find a job will be even harder.
3199,13,14,Se or Lopez,"You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?"
3200,13,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, I do just as much work."
3201,13,14,Se or Lopez,[laughs] You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.
3202,13,14,Eric Cartman,Noooo... [now imagines himself at an open council meeting] Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
3203,13,14,Coucilman and Audience,All those in favor of putting white people in camps?
3204,13,14,Coucilman and Audience,Aye!
3205,13,14,Coucilman and Audience,All those opposed?
3206,13,14,Eric Cartman,Noooo...
3207,13,14,Coucilman and Audience,The minorities win! [Cartman comes out of his daydream]
3208,13,14,Eric Cartman,"[throws down his pad and pen and stands up] NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! [turns away and squeezes his eyes shut.]"
3209,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface."
3210,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Let's just get this over with!
3211,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?
3212,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
3213,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,Good-a. Now just one last thing. [takes a glass sitting next to him and scoops some pee into it] You need to drink-a some pee.
3214,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
3215,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
3216,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,Why?!
3217,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate."
3218,13,14,Stan Marsh,"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?"
3219,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,"I am not, not, d-rinking pee!"
3220,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!"
3221,13,14,Stan Marsh,"Just drink the pee, Kyle."
3222,13,14,Butters Stotch,"Please, Kyle, I wanna go home."
3223,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!"
3224,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
3225,13,14,Pi Pi And His Lawyer,"Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly."
3226,13,14,Kyle Broflovski,No!
3227,13,14,Water Tester,"Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata."
3228,13,14,Researcher 2,"[balding, with gray hair] Wait, you mean a banana."
3229,13,14,Water Tester,Yes.
3230,13,14,Fire Marshal and Firemen,"Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey! [another monkey is brought forth strapped to a dolly] All right, Connors. [Officer connors offers a banana to the monkey, who takes a bite of it after a few seconds. A researcher steps up and starts peeing on the monkey. The monkey doesn't mind it, but just takes another bite of the banana.]"
