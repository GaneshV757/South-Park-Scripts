1,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again."
2,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Zeeponaner.
3,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, you can't come to school with me. [Ike Chortles.]"
4,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, go home you little dildo!"
5,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!"
6,1,1,Stan Marsh,What's a dildo?
7,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I don't know...[He faces Cartman and points at him.] and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!"
8,1,1,Eric Cartman,I know what it means!
9,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what?"
10,1,1,Eric Cartman,I'm not telling you.
11,1,1,Stan Marsh,"What's a dildo, Kenny?"
12,1,1,Kenny McCormick,(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina.) [The others laugh.]
13,1,1,Eric Cartman,"He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right! [Kyle swings Ike by his feet, knocking Cartman down.] Ow! [Ike Laughs.]"
14,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that kicks ass!"
15,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby!"
16,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Don't kick the baby.
17,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Kick the baby.
18,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night."
19,1,1,Eric Cartman,That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
20,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Really? What about?
21,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed..."
22,1,1,Eric Cartman,"...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room."
23,1,1,Eric Cartman,Then slowly my bedroom door began to open... [A Visitor peeks inside.]
24,1,1,Eric Cartman,"...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway."
25,1,1,Eric Cartman,Weeaak!
26,1,1,Eric Cartman,Then I was lying on a table...
27,1,1,Eric Cartman,...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
28,1,1,Stan Marsh,Dude! Visitors!
29,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Totally!
30,1,1,Eric Cartman,What?
31,1,1,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were Visitors!"
32,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, it was just a dream, my mom said so."
33,1,1,Stan Marsh,Visitors are real.
34,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows."
35,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working."
36,1,1,Chef,"[Drives up and gets out of the car.] Hello there, children."
37,1,1,Boys,"Hey, Chef."
38,1,1,Stan Marsh,"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?"
39,1,1,Chef,"Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley."
40,1,1,Eric Cartman,Kick ass.
41,1,1,Chef,"Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?"
42,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Surprised.] Huh?
43,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fat boy saw it!"
44,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!"
45,1,1,Chef,"Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?"
46,1,1,Eric Cartman,Oh!
47,1,1,Stan Marsh,They took him on their ship.
48,1,1,Chef,Oh! [Quietly.] Did they give you an anal probe?
49,1,1,Eric Cartman,Oh!
50,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,What's an anal probe?
51,1,1,Chef,That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt.
52,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
53,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?"
54,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!"
55,1,1,Eric Cartman,No!
56,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Eneh probe.
57,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, dildo!"
58,1,1,Chef,"Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control."
59,1,1,Eric Cartman,Oh!
60,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
61,1,1,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!"
62,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why you walkin' so funny Cartman?
63,1,1,Eric Cartman,Shut up!

69,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Kick the baby!
70,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Good morning, Miss Crabtree."
71,1,1,Ms Veronica Crabtree,Sit down! We're runnin' late!
72,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn it, he's still there."
73,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, don't worry about him."
74,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me."
75,1,1,Ms Crabtree,Sit down back there! Arrrggghhh!!
76,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch."
77,1,1,Ms Crabtree,What did you say!?
78,1,1,Stan Marsh,I said I have a bad itch.
79,1,1,Ms Crabtree,Oh.
80,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[Gasps.] Oh, my God!"
81,1,1,Stan Marsh,[Turning to see.] Visitors!
82,1,1,Kenny McCormick,(Oh nooo!)
83,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike! [Kyle runs to the front of the bus.] Stop the bus! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!"
84,1,1,Ms Crabtree,Do you want an office referral!?
85,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,No.
86,1,1,Ms Crabtree,Then sit down!
87,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,But I...

92,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?"
93,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up you guys, it's not working."
94,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,We have to do something!
95,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us."
96,1,1,Ms Crabtree,What did you say!?
97,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce."
98,1,1,Ms Crabtree,"Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do."
99,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Stan farts.] You farted. [They laugh.]
100,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Heh, somebody's baking brownies."
101,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,That's the third cow this month. At this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through.
102,1,1,Officer Barbrady,This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time.
103,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,People been saying they've been seeing UFO's around.
104,1,1,Officer Barbrady,UFO's? [Laughs.]
105,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,"Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks."
106,1,1,Officer Barbrady,That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
107,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,What was that?
108,1,1,Officer Barbrady,"That, that was a pigeon."
109,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,"What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one?"
110,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,Hey! My cattle!
111,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on!
112,1,1,Officer Barbrady,There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
113,1,1,Mr Herbert Garrison,"And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus."
114,1,1,Mr Hat,"That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492 Columbus started a restaurant...[He is drowned out by Kyle's voice.]"
115,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[Whispering.] Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"""
116,1,1,Stan Marsh,"[Whispering.] Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him."
117,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[His voice is rising to an audible level.] ""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?"""
118,1,1,Stan Marsh,Dude!
119,1,1,Mr Garrison,"Is there a problem, boys?"
120,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now."
121,1,1,Mr Garrison,"Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?"
122,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Silence.] It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe."
123,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Embarrassed.] Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh."
124,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[Kyle walks up to Mr. Garrison's desk.] Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?"
125,1,1,Mr Garrison,"I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?"
126,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!"
127,1,1,Mr Garrison,Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
128,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?"
129,1,1,Mr Hat,"Well, Kyle, no!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!"
130,1,1,Mr Garrison,"Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle."
131,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it!
132,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you."
133,1,1,Eric Cartman,Ow! My ass!
134,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude!
135,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Damn, Cartman!"
136,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Cartman farts fire again.] Uh... Ow! My ass!
137,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he's farting fire!"
138,1,1,Stan Marsh,It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
139,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, that was just a dream."
140,1,1,Mr Garrison,"Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?"
141,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine."
142,1,1,Train Conductor,"Hey, you cows can't get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? 'Cause you're cows."
143,1,1,Train Conductor,"No, no, no. Don't try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? 'Cause it's not gonna work."
144,1,1,Officer Barbrady,"[Drives by with his lights flashing.] Hold it right there, cows!"
145,1,1,Officer Barbrady,Come back here! Now then! [He pursues them.]
146,1,1,A Kid,"So then I had bad, bad gas."
147,1,1,Jason White,"Ya, seriously, killer."
148,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Cartman farts fire.] Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry."
149,1,1,Stan Marsh,How can you eat when you're farting fire?
150,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature."
151,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger."
152,1,1,Stan Marsh,[Gasps.] Where?
153,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Singing.] Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger.
154,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!"
155,1,1,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
156,1,1,Stan Marsh,I do not!
157,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, guys."
158,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi, Wendy."
159,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Hi, Wendy."
160,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Here, Stan. This is for you. [Wendy hands Stan a note.]"
161,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
162,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww! [She leaves.]
163,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[Their eyes follow her out.] Bye, Wendy."
164,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Their eyes follow her out.] Bye, Wendy."
165,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what does the note say?"
166,1,1,Stan Marsh,[He glances at it.] Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.
167,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
168,1,1,Eric Cartman,Or slip her the tongue.
169,1,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)"
170,1,1,Stan Marsh,[That gets his attention.] What? How do you know she has a cat?
171,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back."
172,1,1,Chef,"Hello there, children."
173,1,1,Boys,"Hey, Chef."
174,1,1,Chef,How are you doing?
175,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Bad.
176,1,1,Chef,Why bad?
177,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?"
178,1,1,Chef,"Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.

I'm gonna make love to you woman
Gonna lay you down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make you moan and perspire
Gonna--"
179,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Chef."
180,1,1,Chef,--get those juices flowin'--
181,1,1,Stan Marsh,Chef.
182,1,1,Chef,--we're makin' love gravy--
183,1,1,Stan Marsh,Chef!
184,1,1,Chef,"--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!"
185,1,1,Stan Marsh,Chef!!
186,1,1,Chef,"Love luh--

 Huh?"
187,1,1,Chef,Do you feel better?
188,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,No!
189,1,1,Chef,"Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day."
190,1,1,Stan Marsh,Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
191,1,1,Chef,What?!
192,1,1,Chef,"What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!"
193,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
194,1,1,Eric Cartman,You are making it up.
195,1,1,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
196,1,1,Eric Cartman,What?
197,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,That was cool!
198,1,1,Chef,"It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device."
199,1,1,Chef,This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us.
200,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Turning to face Chef, testily.] Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?"
201,1,1,Chef,"It's no joke, children, this is big!"
202,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me."
203,1,1,Chef,"Uuh, hold on now, hold on now. [To himself.] Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children."
204,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!"
205,1,1,Chef,"[Pulling on the fire alarm] Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out! [To the boys.] Okay children, this is your chance!"
206,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Killer! Thanks, Chef."
207,1,1,Chef,"Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready."
208,1,1,Boys,"[Singing.]
 We got out of school,
No more school today,
We got out of school..."
209,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!"
210,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now."
211,1,1,Eric Cartman,"I would if I could, you son of a bitch!"
212,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?"
213,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!"
214,1,1,Eric Cartman,"I love to singa,
About the moona and June-a and the springa,
I love to singa,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
215,1,1,Stan Marsh,What the hell was that?
216,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors!
217,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Ah, son of a bitch!"
218,1,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control."
219,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Hey!
220,1,1,Eric Cartman,Uh...
221,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,If you Visitors can hear me-
222,1,1,Eric Cartman,Hey...
223,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!"
224,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Ow! [Faces Kyle.] That hurts, you buttlicker!"
225,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, look! It's them."
226,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Give me back my brother!
227,1,1,Stan Marsh,Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
228,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!
229,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn it, we were so close!"
230,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey look, [Kenny gets up.] I think Kenny's okay."
231,1,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!)"
232,1,1,Stan Marsh,Owww.
233,1,1,Kenny McCormick,"[He gets up again.] (Nope, I'm all fine. Agh!)"
234,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Wow, poor Kenny."
235,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Now do you believe us, Cartman?"
236,1,1,Eric Cartman,No!
237,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, they killed Kenny!"
238,1,1,Eric Cartman,He's not dead.
239,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Kenny is dead!"
240,1,1,Stan Marsh,See?
241,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, you guys."
242,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"He's dead, Cartman!"
243,1,1,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe! [He walks off.] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home."
244,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Go on and go home, you fat chicken!"
245,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Off screen.] Dildo!
246,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You're all I have left, Stan."
247,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger."
248,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!"
249,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. [He hurries away.]"
250,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Rats.
251,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Hello, Eric."
252,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Hi, Mom."
253,1,1,Liane Cartman,How are you doing?
254,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!"
255,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise."
256,1,1,Eric Cartman,I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
257,1,1,Liane Cartman,"You're not fat, you're big boned."
258,1,1,Eric Cartman,That's what I said.
259,1,1,Liane Cartman,"You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?"
260,1,1,Eric Cartman,No!
261,1,1,Liane Cartman,Just a weensy eensy woo woo?
262,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, leave me alone mom! [He walks past her.]"
263,1,1,Liane Cartman,"How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?"
264,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[He stops in his tracks.] What? Well, that does sound pretty good."
265,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Uh, Mom?"
266,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Yes, hon?"
267,1,1,Eric Cartman,"If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?"
268,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?"
269,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs."
270,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now."
271,1,1,Stan Marsh,But her note said she'd be here.
272,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, Stan."
273,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
274,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww!
275,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do."
276,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"But why, Stan?"
277,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
278,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww!
279,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?"
280,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,[Turns to Kyle.] Huh?
281,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Just make sweet love down by the fire.
282,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,What happened to your little brother?
283,1,1,News Reporter,"As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns."
284,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck."
285,1,1,News Reporter,"Could it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth?"
286,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
287,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie."
288,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
289,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!"
290,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
291,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!"
292,1,1,Eric Cartman,Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
293,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight."
294,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Confused.] What?
295,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
296,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?"
297,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
298,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back."
299,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. [He moves out.]"
300,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Come on, Stan. [She walks past him, following Kyle.]"
301,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
302,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww! [She walks away.]
303,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?"
304,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
305,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have any!"
306,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
307,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!"
308,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty."
309,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Eric, look who's here."
310,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, weak mom."
311,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop."
312,1,1,Eric Cartman,"I can't, my mom said..."
313,1,1,Liane Cartman,"That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends."
314,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Quietly.] But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--"
315,1,1,Liane Cartman,"[Stern.] Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow."
316,1,1,Eric Cartman,God damn it!
317,1,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I have to get home."
318,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again."
319,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks."
320,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,How come the Visitors aren't coming for him?
321,1,1,Stan Marsh,I think we have to signal them somehow.
322,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Cartman farts fire.] Ow!
323,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, he's like Rudolph."
324,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come!"
325,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight."
326,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Sure you do!
327,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on Cartman, fart!"
328,1,1,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna.
329,1,1,Stan Marsh,[To Kyle and Wendy.] He can't hold it in forever.
330,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Fart, damn you!"
331,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!"
332,1,1,Eric Cartman,I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
333,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, it's happening again."
334,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, look at that."
335,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Now, do you believe us, Cartman?"
336,1,1,Eric Cartman,You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
337,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!"
338,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Sure, you guys, what-ever."
339,1,1,Chef,"Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom! [He looks at his watch.] And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on."
340,1,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!"
341,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God damn it!"
342,1,1,Mr Garrison,"[Driving by, he stops.] What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town."
343,1,1,Mr Hat,"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
344,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come down here, you stinking aliens! [Three Visitors appear.] Uh, uh..."
345,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back."
346,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing."
347,1,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
348,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again."
349,1,1,Stan Marsh,"That was beautiful, dude."
350,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Did it work?
351,1,1,Stan Marsh,"No, they're leaving."
352,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, you scrawny-assed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!"
353,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude!"
354,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
355,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey Wendy, what's a fuck? [She shrugs.]"
356,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Help me doy tair.
357,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!"
358,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Don't hurt me.
359,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo... Moo...Moo...Moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)"
360,1,1,Cows,Moo?? (Really??)
361,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!"
362,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Don't kick the baby.
363,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)"
364,1,1,Eric Cartman,What the hell are they talking about?
365,1,1,Cow,Moo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?)
366,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.)"
367,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo...moo...moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)"
368,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Ike!
369,1,1,Carl the Visitor,Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)
370,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
371,1,1,Ike Broflovski,It's my turn!
372,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)"
373,1,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, get me down from here!"
374,1,1,Eric Cartman,Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
375,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with."
376,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike."
377,1,1,Ike Broflovski,"Oh, he fly out the sky."
378,1,1,Chef,"Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back!"
379,1,1,Blonde woman,"Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us."
380,1,1,Chef,"Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in."
381,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. [They leave.]"
382,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Thanks for your help, Wendy."
383,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Whatever, dude."
384,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, I didn't throw up."
385,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Cool!
386,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
387,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww!
388,1,1,Stan Marsh,Sorry.
389,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, look. A French fry."
390,1,1,Stan Marsh,Cool.
391,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,And what is that?
392,1,1,Stan Marsh,I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
393,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, what's that?"
394,1,1,Stan Marsh,"That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago."
395,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh hey, what about that?"
396,1,1,Stan Marsh,I don't know what the hell that is...
397,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around."
398,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we're running out of friends."
399,1,1,Stan Marsh,I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.
400,1,1,Cows,Mooo.
401,1,1,Officer Barbrady,Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now.
402,1,1,Officer Barbrady,"I love to sing-a,
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a,
I love to sing-a,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
403,1,1,Eric Cartman,Puh!
404,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hey Cartman."
405,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school."
406,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night."
407,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Really, what about?"
408,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye."
409,1,1,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened."
410,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Sarcastically.] Oh right, [Matter of factly.] why don't I have pinkeye then?"
411,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you do have pinkeye!"
412,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Ahh, son of a bitch!"
413,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?"
414,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it was huge."
415,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, I hate those things."
416,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody hates rainbows.
417,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?"
418,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: ""EHY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!"" [Silence.]"
419,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?"
420,1,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!"
421,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
422,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Ohh, rainbows. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool."
423,1,2,Stan Marsh,What were you talking about?
424,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it."
425,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?"
426,1,2,Eric Cartman,Nothing..!
427,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? [Silence.] One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize."
428,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[Softly.] Wow, I knew I would win."
429,1,2,Mr Hat,"Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting."
430,1,2,Mr Garrison,"That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman."
431,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,What?
432,1,2,Eric Cartman,What?
433,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper."
434,1,2,Eric Cartman,Kick ass!
435,1,2,Stan Marsh,"That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart."
436,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted."
437,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner."
438,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, what did you write about Cartman?"
439,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you know, this and that."
440,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
441,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,What was your paper about Wendy?
442,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.
443,1,2,Eric Cartman,"There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid."
444,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet."
445,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?"
446,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,What?
447,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford."
448,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
449,1,2,Mr Garrison,And the presentation will be on national television.
450,1,2,Stan Marsh,Television!
451,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Television!
452,1,2,Mr Garrison,[Thinking to himself.] Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.
453,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
454,1,2,Ted,"Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity."
455,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator."
456,1,2,Johnson,Maybe even a State Senator.
457,1,2,Ted,"Mayor, we should decorate the town square."
458,1,2,Johnson,"Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town."
459,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?"
460,1,2,Ted,Black as the night itself Mayor.
461,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
462,1,2,Ted,If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
463,1,2,Johnson,Ohhh.
464,1,2,Ted,Ouch. [Johnson Laughs.] Thank you.
465,1,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous."
466,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,[Passing by.] Hitler was famous too.
467,1,2,Chef,[Stopping by.] Hello there children.
468,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Chef."
469,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Chef."
470,1,2,Chef,How are my little crackers today?
471,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Good.
472,1,2,Stan Marsh,Good.
473,1,2,Chef,Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
474,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest."
475,1,2,Eric Cartman,Hey!
476,1,2,Chef,Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
477,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, are you gonna do it?"
478,1,2,Chef,"Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation."
479,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that'd be cool."
480,1,2,Kenny McCormick,"(How big's your penis, Chef?)"
481,1,2,Chef,"Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway."
482,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement."
483,1,2,Mr Garrison,Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
484,1,2,Mr Hat,[Now on Mr. Garrison's hand.] Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?
485,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child."
486,1,2,Mr Hat,"We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge."
487,1,2,Lil Mr Garrison,"Knock knock, Mr. Hat."
488,1,2,Mr Hat,Who's there?
489,1,2,Lil Mr Garrison,Orange.
490,1,2,Mr Hat,Orange who?
491,1,2,Lil Mr Garrison,Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
492,1,2,Mr Hat,Thank you.
493,1,2,Lil Mr Garrison,"Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win."
494,1,2,Show Announcer,"And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein."
495,1,2,Lil Kathie Lee,"If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract
[Mexican puppet] All I can say is, ""Wow-wee, look-a where I am.""
[Tourist puppet] Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!"
496,1,2,Mr Garrison,"It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that?"
497,1,2,Mr Hat,"But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better."
498,1,2,Mr Garrison,How?
499,1,2,Mr Garrison,"No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!"
500,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay."
501,1,2,Eric Cartman,That kid is me.
502,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park."
503,1,2,Mr Garrison,"That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat."
504,1,2,Mr Hat,[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.
505,1,2,Mr Garrison,[Whispers.] Mr. Hat!
506,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play."
507,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her."
508,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated."
509,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!"
510,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,And who's our little prize winner again?
511,1,2,Eric Cartman,Me! Eric Cartman!
512,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?"
513,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Yes ma'am. [Sings.]
I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television."
514,1,2,Eric Cartman,"[Still singing.]
...I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television..."
515,1,2,Stan Marsh,"[Turning to face Cartman.] We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy."
516,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish."
517,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly."
518,1,2,Eric Cartman,Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
519,1,2,Stan Marsh,Dolphins are way smarter than you!
520,1,2,Eric Cartman,"If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?"
521,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!"
522,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!"
523,1,2,Stan Marsh,Tell me what you wrote about!
524,1,2,Eric Cartman,I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
525,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!"
526,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!"
527,1,2,TV Announcer,"We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this."
528,1,2,Beefcake,Hey!! You need to get in shape fast?! Wanna look your best?! Tired the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!
529,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds."
530,1,2,Beefcake,"Then bulk up quick, with Weight Gain 4000!!"
531,1,2,Eric Cartman,Yes!
532,1,2,Beefcake,"With over 4,000 grams of saturated fat per serving, its patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go to directly to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream. Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today, and say with me: 'Beefcake!'"
533,1,2,Eric Cartman,Beefcake!
534,1,2,Beefcake,Beefcake!
535,1,2,Eric Cartman,Beefcake!
536,1,2,Beefcake,Beefcake!
537,1,2,Beefcake,[In unison] BEEFCAKE!
538,1,2,Eric Cartman,[In unison] BEEFCAKE!
539,1,2,TV Announcer,May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver...
540,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?"
541,1,2,Liane Cartman,"Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow."
542,1,2,Eric Cartman,"But mom, I need it for tomorrow."
543,1,2,Liane Cartman,But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.
544,1,2,Eric Cartman,"[Shrieking.] Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!"
545,1,2,Liane Cartman,"Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then."
546,1,2,Mr Garrison,"No, no!"
547,1,2,Mr Hat,[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.
548,1,2,Mr Garrison,"No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it."
549,1,2,Mr Hat,Kill!
550,1,2,Mr Garrison,"That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat."
551,1,2,Mr Hat,She'll make a fool of you again.
552,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy."
553,1,2,Eric Cartman,Hey dudes.
554,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?"
555,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?"
556,1,2,Stan Marsh,What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
557,1,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm up to 94, thank you very much."
558,1,2,Kenny McCormick,(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
559,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's."
560,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff."
561,1,2,Stan Marsh,What's that stuff?
562,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up."
563,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Bulk up to what, fat-ass?"
564,1,2,Stan Marsh,Super fat-ass?
565,1,2,Eric Cartman,Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
566,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh."
567,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!"
568,1,2,Cows,[Out in a pasture.] Mooooo?
569,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?"
570,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top."
571,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it."
572,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage."
573,1,2,Mr Garrison,Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage.
574,1,2,Clyde Donovan,"Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?"
575,1,2,Mr Garrison,Do you have a feather on your head?
576,1,2,Clyde Donovan,Yes.
577,1,2,Mr Garrison,Then you're an Indian.
578,1,2,Clyde Donovan,Oh.
579,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Okay Bebe, this is your line."
580,1,2,Bebe Stevens,[Haltingly.] This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
581,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, don't they look adorable?"
582,1,2,Bebe Stevens,"Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers."
583,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Oh my God!
584,1,2,Mr Garrison,"They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy."
585,1,2,Bebe Stevens,"The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands."
586,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford."
587,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days."
588,1,2,Stan Marsh,Take that you stupid Indian!
589,1,2,Clyde Donovan,Dow!
590,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?"
591,1,2,Mr Garrison,To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!
592,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh my God, what have I said?"
593,1,2,Townsman,"He said, ""To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"""
594,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play."
595,1,2,Mr Hat,[In his deep voice.] It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.
596,1,2,Mr Garrison,I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it.
597,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load."
598,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely."
599,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!"
600,1,2,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
601,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"""
602,1,2,Eric Cartman,"No they don't, you jealous weakling!"
603,1,2,Townsman,"God damn, that's a big fat ass!"
604,1,2,Eric Cartman,Hey!
605,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,Hi guys.
606,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh look, another hippie."
607,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Peace, Wendy."
608,1,2,Stan Marsh,Shut up Cartman!
609,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Oooh, 
Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree..."
610,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
611,1,2,Eric Cartman,...K I S S I N G. First comes the baby and...
612,1,2,Jimbo Kern,Can I help you?
613,1,2,Mr Garrison,Yes... I need a gun.
614,1,2,Jimbo Kern,"Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?"
615,1,2,Mr Garrison,Other.
616,1,2,Jimbo Kern,"Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!"
617,1,2,Jimbo Kern,That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
618,1,2,Mr Garrison,"[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] I don't know, it's a little small."
619,1,2,Jimbo Kern,"Okay, how about this?"
620,1,2,Mr Garrison,"[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] Hmm, no, I don't like this one either."
621,1,2,Jimbo Kern,"Here's the same gun, with a wood finish."
622,1,2,Mr Garrison,"[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me. [To Jimbo.] I'll take it!"
623,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,Hello?
624,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"My essay by Eric Cartman: ""When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."""
625,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!"
626,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,[Hushed.] Oh my God.
627,1,2,Townsman,"Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun."
628,1,2,Mr Garrison,Thank you.
629,1,2,Townswoman,Nice gun Mr. Garrison.
630,1,2,Mr Garrison,Thanks.
631,1,2,Mr Garrison,Hello Officer Barbrady.
632,1,2,Officer Barbrady,Nice Gun.
633,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee."
634,1,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet."
635,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady."
636,1,2,Officer Barbrady,No problem.
637,1,2,Officer Barbrady,Heah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee!
638,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,[On stage.] Where is she?
639,1,2,Eric Cartman,This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
640,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
641,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[Rushing in.] You guys, we have to stop him!"
642,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Stop who?
643,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
644,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame."
645,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,He's got a gun!
646,1,2,Eric Cartman,"You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you."
647,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!"
648,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?"
649,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[Sweetly.] Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?"
650,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh oh, we're losing him."
651,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Here she comes.
652,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford."
653,1,2,Townswoman,"We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh."
654,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,"I love you, too."
655,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Come on you little bitch. [Takes aim.] You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy."
656,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,[On stage.] It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
657,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford."
658,1,2,Chef,"Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of uh, the humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.

Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you dowwwwn.
And lick every inch of your bodaay with my tongue."
659,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,What?
660,1,2,Chef,"Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy."
661,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,What? Oh God!
662,1,2,Chef,How 'bout you and meee-
663,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song."
664,1,2,Chef,"-get together and make... sweet... 

 love?"
665,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Thank you Chef!
666,1,2,Chef McDaniels,"Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!"
667,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[Wendy and Stan run up.] Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!"
668,1,2,Officer Barbrady,What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. [Flashes back.]
669,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee."
670,1,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ..."
671,1,2,Officer Barbrady,"Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!"
672,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, look!"
673,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman..."
674,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Cartman, God damn it."
675,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"...is your favorite celebrity, and mine, [Crowd cheers.] Kathie Lee Gifford!"
676,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,Thank you. I love you all.
677,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Garrison, stop!"
678,1,2,Mr Garrison,Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
679,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
680,1,2,Mr Garrison,You can't know.
681,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,You should have won that talent show.
682,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,"It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?"
683,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Here it is, my big moment of fame."
684,1,2,Mr Garrison,...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
685,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer."
686,1,2,Mr Garrison,"It is... too late for me, young Wendy."
687,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose."
688,1,2,Mr Garrison,You... you're right.
689,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,Gooood.
690,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?"
691,1,2,Mr Hat,[Snapping into position.] The bitch must die!
692,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,Ooohhhh!
693,1,2,Kenny McCormick,(Oh no!)
694,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!"
695,1,2,Agent 1,Gun!
696,1,2,Agent 2,Gun!
697,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play."
698,1,2,TV Crew Director,"I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up."
699,1,2,Eric Cartman,Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
700,1,2,TV Crew Director,"Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest."
701,1,2,Eric Cartman,[Whining.] But I won the environmental essay contest.
702,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.
703,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place."
704,1,2,Townsman 1,Who cares?
705,1,2,Townsman 2,"Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone."
706,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?"
707,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, not if it's Cartman."
708,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, where are you all going!"
709,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,They don't even know what Walden is.
710,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
711,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches."
712,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Ah, what the hell."
713,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!"
714,1,2,Ted,"Uh, Mayor, the mic is on."
715,1,2,Officer Barbrady,"[Arresting Mr. Hat.] Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?"
716,1,2,Mr Hat,"Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids."
717,1,2,Officer Barbrady,You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt.
718,1,2,Stan Marsh,We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
719,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy."
720,1,2,Mr Hat,We can still get her! Let mmm--
721,1,2,Mr Garrison,I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
722,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway."
723,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Really, on what?"
724,1,2,Geraldo Rivera,"Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house."
725,1,2,Eric Cartman,When is this going to be on the air?
726,1,2,Geraldo Rivera,Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
727,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!"
728,1,2,Chef,He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
729,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,"Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?"
730,1,2,Chef,"Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?"
731,1,3,Liane Cartman,"Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous."
732,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Mom."
733,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ready to go hunting, Cartman?"
734,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?"
735,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning."
736,1,3,Liane Cartman,"Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts."
737,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe."
738,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?"
739,1,3,Liane Cartman,"Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy."
740,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that's sick mom."
741,1,3,Liane Cartman,"And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away."
742,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Drive, Drive!"
743,1,3,Liane Cartman,You give your mommy a kissy.
744,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Drive the car damn-it, drive!"
745,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,[In a slight falsetto.] Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
746,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing."
747,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman."
748,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(Maybe she'll suck my dick.)
749,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, ho, that's disgusting."
750,1,3,Eric Cartman,"You piece of crap, I'll kill you!"
751,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'."
752,1,3,Eric Cartman,Eeeeenh!
753,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber."
754,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer."
755,1,3,Jimbo Kern,You what?!?
756,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm."
757,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,I like chocolate milk.
758,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization."
759,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes."
760,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I didn't get a gun."
761,1,3,Eric Cartman,Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
762,1,3,Stan Marsh,"You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman."
763,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,Were you stationed in Da Nang?
764,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says."
765,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off."
766,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer."
767,1,3,Stan Marsh,"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa."
768,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that'd be cool."
769,1,3,Eric Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
770,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!"
771,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there."
772,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality."
773,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean?
774,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting."
775,1,3,Eric Cartman,Democrats piss me off!
776,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'"
777,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo."
778,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, Jimbo look, mm."
779,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!"
780,1,3,Eric Cartman,Kickass!!
781,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck."
782,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock."
783,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"[Drops to the ground.] Let's move, moove!"
784,1,3,Stan Marsh,Is this hunting?
785,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,I guess so.
786,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks."
787,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
788,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!"
789,1,3,Jimbo Kern,This one's yours Stan.
790,1,3,Jimbo Kern,[Calmly.]It's coming right for us.
791,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,It's coming right for us.
792,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Shoot it Stan.
793,1,3,Eric Cartman,"I got your back, soldier."
794,1,3,Stan Marsh,I can't.
795,1,3,Jimbo Kern,What the? What's wrong with you?
796,1,3,Stan Marsh,I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
797,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical."
798,1,3,Stan Marsh,"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny."
799,1,3,Jimbo Kern,No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.
800,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything."
801,1,3,Stan Marsh,"I can shoot you, fat ass!"
802,1,3,Eric Cartman,I can shoot you too!
803,1,3,Stan Marsh,I'll kill you!
804,1,3,Eric Cartman,I'll fill you full of lead!
805,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, what's that?"
806,1,3,Randy Marsh,What the heck is this?
807,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check."
808,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!"
809,1,3,Eric Cartman,My weenies won't cook.
810,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm."
811,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick."
812,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, yepper."
813,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, aahh, oh."
814,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!"
815,1,3,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
816,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa!
817,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?"
818,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm."
819,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah."
820,1,3,Chef,"But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?"
821,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but..."
822,1,3,Johnson,"Mayor, the geologist is here to see you."
823,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
824,1,3,Johnson,"No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth."
825,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!"
826,1,3,Johnson,"I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker."
827,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,Just send in the geometrist.
828,1,3,Johnson,Geologist...
829,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"You are fired, buddy!"
830,1,3,Johnson,"Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you."
831,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt."
832,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,What does this mean to the town?
833,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad."
834,1,3,Randy Marsh,Right now South Park is here.
835,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,My God!
836,1,3,Chef,"Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!"
837,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? [Beeps out.]"
838,1,3,Ted,"Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted."
839,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. [Thump.] Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control."
840,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day."
841,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmowwwh.
842,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hah, got ya."
843,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Heh, tha-that's not scary."
844,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!
845,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!"
846,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hey Ned, hand me that gin."
847,1,3,Jimbo Kern,You boys want to tie one on?
848,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee."
849,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Cartman's pee."
850,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you would taste my pee!"
851,1,3,Jimbo Kern,What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?
852,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Christ, look at that little bastard go!"
853,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!"
854,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too."
855,1,3,Eric Cartman,Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
856,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!"
857,1,3,Eric Cartman,Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt?
858,1,3,Stan Marsh,Whatabutt?
859,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top."
860,1,3,Stan Marsh,Why?
861,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body."
862,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Deformed how?
863,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has..."
864,1,3,Stan Marsh,A hook.
865,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,A knife.
866,1,3,Eric Cartman,No! A piece of celery.
867,1,3,Stan Marsh,Celery?
868,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy."
869,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!"
870,1,3,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink."
871,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories."
872,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, give me that flashlight."
873,1,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, what's that?)"
874,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,What is that?
875,1,3,Stan Marsh,Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
876,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, it might be!"
877,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand."
878,1,3,Eric Cartman,Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
879,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song."
880,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
[Uncle Jimbo cries]
Mmmoh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah..."
881,1,3,Eric Cartman,They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
882,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"...Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah."
883,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, Stan, wake up!"
884,1,3,Stan Marsh,"What, dude?"
885,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
886,1,3,Stan Marsh,Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
887,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,They're out fishing with Kenny.
888,1,3,Stan Marsh,"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?"
889,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well Stan, you want to know what I think?"
890,1,3,Stan Marsh,What?
891,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!"
892,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, got it."
893,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Great instincts boy.
894,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!"
895,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Who? The fat kid?
896,1,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
897,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!"
898,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit."
899,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,[Rowing to shore.] Moh man it smells like dead fish here.
900,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(A little like a vagina.)
901,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Em-moh man, that is nasty."
902,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew."
903,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(Thanks.)
904,1,3,Newscaster,"The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony."
905,1,3,Crowd,Yeahhh.
906,1,3,Individual in crowd,"Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!"
907,1,3,Newscaster,"Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?"
908,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"All we know right now is that some of our children [Sob-sob.] are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?"
909,1,3,Newscaster,Huh?
910,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 [Melodramatically.] All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids."
911,1,3,Chef,Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
912,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off."
913,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm."
914,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on."
915,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast."
916,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.
917,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!"
918,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun."
919,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Look!
920,1,3,Eric Cartman,"I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg."
921,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, what is it?"
922,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying."
923,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
924,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"We'll be on the cover of ""Guns & Ammo""."
925,1,3,Jimbo Kern,This calls for some HJ-14.
926,1,3,Eric Cartman,[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
927,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Fire in the hoooole!
928,1,3,Eric Cartman,Holy crap!
929,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Damn it, I think I missed."
930,1,3,Eric Cartman,What the hell is wrong with you people?!
931,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"C'mon, let's move, move!"
932,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, wait, aah!"
933,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!"
934,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea."
935,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Huh, what?"
936,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely."
937,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"And, that would be good? Right?"
938,1,3,Randy Marsh,Uh - pretty sure.
939,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!"
940,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! [Shoots a bald eagle.] The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe."
941,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[Sees Cartman still dressed as Scuzzlebutt] Look, up there."
942,1,3,Eric Cartman,"You guys, it's just me."
943,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
944,1,3,Stan Marsh,Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
945,1,3,Jimbo Kern,I can't tell; let's kill it!
946,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume."
947,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Kenny, you take the front."
948,1,3,Stan Marsh,No!
949,1,3,Stan Marsh,I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
950,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!"
951,1,3,Eric Cartman,"You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!"
952,1,3,Newscaster,"As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary."
953,1,3,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please."
954,1,3,Host,"Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a [Film skips] May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt."
955,1,3,Host,"That's right Jane, duck and cover."
956,1,3,Host,So what will you [Film skips] -do when you hear a volcano erupting?
957,1,3,Host,"That's right, duck and cover."
958,1,3,Host,Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.
959,1,3,Officer Barbrady,"OK, any questions?"
960,1,3,Chef,That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
961,1,3,Officer Barbrady,That's enough out of you!
962,1,3,Stan Marsh,I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
963,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, seriously you guys!"
964,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[Hushed.] Kill it, Stan. Kill it. [Normally.] Come on Stan, kill it."
965,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Ah, damn it, I can't do it!"
966,1,3,Jimbo Kern,You pansy! give me that gun.
967,1,3,Eric Cartman,Hey!
968,1,3,Stan Marsh,Cartman?
969,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Goddammit, don't shoot me!"
970,1,3,Jimbo Kern,What the Sam Hell?
971,1,3,Eric Cartman,"I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now."
972,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, so much for the cover of ""Guns & Ammo""."
973,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-"
974,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa!
975,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, holy crap."
976,1,3,Jimbo Kern,The mountain! It's blown it's top!
977,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
978,1,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Nope, I'm okay.)"
979,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)
980,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(Ugh.)
981,1,3,Townsman 1,"Look, the volcano."
982,1,3,Townsman 2,"Quick, duck and cover."
983,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Aaaaah!
984,1,3,Stan Marsh,Aaaaah!
985,1,3,Eric Cartman,Aaaaah!
986,1,3,Jimbo Kern,That lava's coming right for us!!
987,1,3,Chef,"Oh no, look."
988,1,3,Jimbo Kern,What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
989,1,3,Newscaster,"It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava."
990,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-"
991,1,3,Eric Cartman,Help!
992,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!"
993,1,3,Eric Cartman,What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
994,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God! Look at his leg!
995,1,3,Patrick Duffy,"Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy."
996,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Quick Ned, shoot it!"
997,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmmoh no, out of ammo."
998,1,3,Scuzzlebutt,Grrrr.
999,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,What... is that thing?
1000,1,3,Chef,That's Scuzzlebutt.
1001,1,3,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets."
1002,1,3,Officer Barbrady,This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
1003,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed."
1004,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Aaaaah!
1005,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, he built a wicker basket."
1006,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, he's saving us."
1007,1,3,Scuzzlebutt,Grrr.
1008,1,3,Liane Cartman,Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
1009,1,3,Randy Marsh,And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
1010,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
1011,1,3,Randy Marsh,Uhh...
1012,1,3,Denver citizens,Aaaaah.
1013,1,3,Mr Garrison,South Park is saved.
1014,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey look, Kenny's okay."
1015,1,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey guys, what's goin' down?)"
1016,1,3,Newscaster,And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
1017,1,3,Chef,"Mmmm
Baby every time that we kiss,
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava,
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat,
Lava so warm and red and wet,
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr."
1018,1,3,Newscaster,"Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?"
1019,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt."
1020,1,3,Scuzzlebutt,Friend.
1021,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, how sweet."
1022,1,3,Stan Marsh,"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something."
1023,1,3,Newscaster,Oh my God! What has he done?
1024,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,Turn off the cameras!
1025,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, that was easy!"
1026,1,3,Patrick Duffy,Noooo! Why God? Why?!
1027,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!"
1028,1,3,Stan Marsh,What?! Why?!
1029,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, make up your mind, dude!"
1030,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?"
1031,1,3,Stan Marsh,No.
1032,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm."
1033,1,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh, no!)"
1034,1,3,Stan Marsh,"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny."
1035,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?"
1036,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I don't understand hunting at all."
1037,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, [He drops his gun.] it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons."
1038,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.]"
1039,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice."
1040,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Hiya, Sparky."
1041,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,[Looking] Who's that?
1042,1,4,Stan Marsh,That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
1043,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! Cool!
1044,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?"
1045,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Eh. You're making me sick, dude."
1046,1,4,Stan Marsh,He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
1047,1,4,Eric Cartman,No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
1048,1,4,Sylvester,Arrrrrr.
1049,1,4,Stan Marsh,He's not meaner than Sparky.
1050,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!"
1051,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky'll kick his ass.
1052,1,4,Eric Cartman,I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
1053,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You're on, dude!"
1054,1,4,Stan Marsh,"That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!"
1055,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass."
1056,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky! Bad dog!
1057,1,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)"
1058,1,4,Stan Marsh,What?!
1059,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay."
1060,1,4,Stan Marsh,What do you mean?
1061,1,4,Eric Cartman,That dog is a gay homosexual.
1062,1,4,Stan Marsh,He's just confused.
1063,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
1064,1,4,Kenny McCormick,"(No, check his penis.)"
1065,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Sick, shut up dude!"
1066,1,4,Eric Cartman,Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.
1067,1,4,Chef,"Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park."
1068,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Who's Middle Park?
1069,1,4,Eric Cartman,What's homecoming?
1070,1,4,Chef,"But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. [silence] Now, let's start practice."
1071,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?"
1072,1,4,Chef,"Yes Pip, what is it?"
1073,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Well, I still don't have a helmet."
1074,1,4,Chef,"I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody."
1075,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?"
1076,1,4,Chef,"Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does."
1077,1,4,Pip Pirrip,Oh.
1078,1,4,Chef,"Sorry son, now get your ass in there."
1079,1,4,Stan Marsh,Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
1080,1,4,Chef,[impatiently] Hike the damn ball!
1081,1,4,Pip Pirrip,Aaaaaaaargh!
1082,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?"
1083,1,4,Chef,"[distracted] Huh? Oh, fine, fine."
1084,1,4,Jimbo Kern,I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.
1085,1,4,Chef,Elementary school alumni?
1086,1,4,Jimbo Kern,That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
1087,1,4,Chef,I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
1088,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Middle Park by 70 points.
1089,1,4,Chef,Hmmm...
1090,1,4,Chef,I don't think we have a chance.
1091,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. [yells] Right Stanley?
1092,1,4,Stan Marsh,Huh?
1093,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Atta boy!
1094,1,4,Chef,"Great pass, Stan."
1095,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!"
1096,1,4,Chef,Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
1097,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?"
1098,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart."
1099,1,4,Clyde Donovan,"Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time."
1100,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down!"
1101,1,4,Clyde Donovan,Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!
1102,1,4,Eric Cartman,There he goes again.
1103,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Get down, Sparky! Down!"
1104,1,4,Eric Cartman,Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
1105,1,4,Clyde Donovan,Make him stop!
1106,1,4,Rex,Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!
1107,1,4,Fosse McDonald,I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.
1108,1,4,Bill Allen,"Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan."
1109,1,4,Fosse McDonald,Gay dog.
1110,1,4,Eric Cartman,"...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television."
1111,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-."
1112,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Ah, dammit!"
1113,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?"
1114,1,4,Mr Hat,"Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?"
1115,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next."
1116,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Um, I'm not really prepared either."
1117,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Well, just make something up, like Eric did."
1118,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-"
1119,1,4,Mr Garrison,Excellent. A-.
1120,1,4,Eric Cartman,Eeyy!
1121,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Wow, cool!"
1122,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?"
1123,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people."
1124,1,4,Eric Cartman,That's not fair!
1125,1,4,Mr Hat,"Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it."
1126,1,4,Eric Cartman,Stupid puppet.
1127,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan."
1128,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?"
1129,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Well of course Stanley, what is it?"
1130,1,4,Stan Marsh,What's a... homosexual?
1131,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down."
1132,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?"
1133,1,4,Stan Marsh,I guess.
1134,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual."
1135,1,4,Eric Cartman,You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
1136,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
1137,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog."
1138,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, dude!"
1139,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?"
1140,1,4,Sparky,"Bark, bark."
1141,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen."
1142,1,4,Stan Marsh,"He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky."
1143,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Good boy, now shake."
1144,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Good boy. Now, don't be gay."
1145,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay."
1146,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Did it work?
1147,1,4,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
1148,1,4,Eric Cartman,He still looks pretty gay to me.
1149,1,4,Bill Allen,"Huh, huh."
1150,1,4,Fosse McDonald,"Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?"
1151,1,4,Bill Allen,"Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbara Streisand concert. [they laugh] Stupid little gay dog."
1152,1,4,Fosse McDonald,Gay dog.
1153,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Come on you guys, I have an idea."
1154,1,4,Jimbo Kern,I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
1155,1,4,Bookie,Are you crazy?
1156,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread."
1157,1,4,Gambler 1,I want to put all my money on the Cows.
1158,1,4,Gambler 2,"Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it."
1159,1,4,Gambler 3,"Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too."
1160,1,4,Female Gambler 1,I got 500 on the Cows.
1161,1,4,Female Gambler 2,"Well, I'll put my money on the Cows."
1162,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now..."
1163,1,4,Gambler 4,"You better be right about this, Jimbo."
1164,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself."
1165,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Are you sure Stan is that good?
1166,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?"
1167,1,4,Bookie,You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.
1168,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,I love that song.
1169,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget."
1170,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-"
1171,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!"
1172,1,4,Stan Marsh,"No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi."
1173,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Ooh-la-la.
1174,1,4,Eric Cartman,There he goes!
1175,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Atta boy, Spark! Get her!"
1176,1,4,Stan Marsh,Yes!
1177,1,4,Stan Marsh,Ah crap! Now what do I do?
1178,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
1179,1,4,Eric Cartman,"No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France."
1180,1,4,Kenny McCormick,(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
1181,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil."
1182,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else."
1183,1,4,Stan Marsh,Like who?
1184,1,4,TV Announcer,And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.
1185,1,4,Jesus Christ,"Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]"
1186,1,4,Robert,"Yeah, is, is this Jesus?"
1187,1,4,Jesus Christ,Yes my son.
1188,1,4,Robert,"This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife."
1189,1,4,Jesus Christ,Of course Robert. How are things now?
1190,1,4,Robert,"Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins, that was really nice of you."
1191,1,4,Jesus Christ,"Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]"
1192,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual."
1193,1,4,Jesus Christ,"My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-"
1194,1,4,TV Announcer,"That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews."
1195,1,4,Stan Marsh,Damn it!
1196,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,What'd he say?
1197,1,4,Stan Marsh,I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
1198,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!"
1199,1,4,Stan Marsh,Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
1200,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on dude, we have to get to practice."
1201,1,4,Stan Marsh,"No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!"
1202,1,4,Stan Marsh,I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
1203,1,4,Chef,"Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. [Music starts.] Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! [Sinks into the mood.]

Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm."
1204,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Chef?"
1205,1,4,Chef,"Spank it, ever so gently."
1206,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Chef.
1207,1,4,Chef,Spank it.
1208,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Chef!
1209,1,4,Chef,"Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays."
1210,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Uh, Mr. Chef sir?"
1211,1,4,Chef,"No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you."
1212,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?"
1213,1,4,Chef,"That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?"
1214,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"No um, I guess not."
1215,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime."
1216,1,4,Carl,What moment would that be?
1217,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F."
1218,1,4,Carl,What high F?
1219,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"You know, 
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah."
1220,1,4,Carl,"Right, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?"
1221,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"No, dammit! The aaaaah!"
1222,1,4,Carl,Aaaaahh?
1223,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Aaaaahh.
1224,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Aaaaahh!
1225,1,4,Carl,Aaaaahh.
1226,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Great.
1227,1,4,Carl,Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah.
1228,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Doo-nn-doo-doo
1229,1,4,Jimbo Kern,You got it.
1230,1,4,Carl,Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...
1231,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Aaa - dooo...
1232,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Aaaaahh!
1233,1,4,Carl,"Alright, yeah, okay..."
1234,1,4,Chef,"What's the matter Stan, you seem down."
1235,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay."
1236,1,4,Chef,"Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks."
1237,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda."
1238,1,4,Chef,Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
1239,1,4,Mr Garrison,What do you mean?
1240,1,4,Chef,"Well, you're gay aren't you?"
1241,1,4,Mr Garrison,What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
1242,1,4,Chef,"Well, you sure do act like it."
1243,1,4,Mr Garrison,"I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass."
1244,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,What's the matter dude?
1245,1,4,Stan Marsh,I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
1246,1,4,Eric Cartman,Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!
1247,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al."
1248,1,4,Big Gay Al,Have you been outcast?
1249,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?"
1250,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here."
1251,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back."
1252,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, it's been like two days."
1253,1,4,Stan Marsh,I think he might've run away.
1254,1,4,Eric Cartman,Did you check the shopping ma- [Stan punches him] Ow!
1255,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan."
1256,1,4,Stan Marsh,I'm not playing.
1257,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,You what?!
1258,1,4,Stan Marsh,I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. [leaves]
1259,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"[whispering] Come on Ned, and keep quiet."
1260,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,[louder] Okay.
1261,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hello there, Enrique."
1262,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,What are we doing here?
1263,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead."
1264,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in ""Loving You"", Boom!"
1265,1,4,Jimbo Kern,No more Middle Park players.
1266,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"God damn, I love football!"
1267,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
1268,1,4,Cowboys,Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!
1269,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows."
1270,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up."
1271,1,4,Chef,"[between his teeth] Oohh, come on, Stan..."
1272,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?"
1273,1,4,Chef,"No Pip, I'm sorry!"
1274,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky! Sparky!
1275,1,4,Referee,Play ball.
1276,1,4,Chef,"You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle."
1277,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,But I never practiced quarterback.
1278,1,4,Chef,Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.
1279,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski."
1280,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Hey hey, where is little Stanley?"
1281,1,4,Mr Hat,"Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?"
1282,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Ned, look!"
1283,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached."
1284,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Yay.
1285,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Hi little fella, how are you doing today?"
1286,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Fine, how are you?"
1287,1,4,Big Gay Al,"I'm super, thanks for asking."
1288,1,4,Stan Marsh,My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
1289,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Well, let's see. Come on in. [they enter]"
1290,1,4,Stan Marsh,Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
1291,1,4,Big Gay Al,We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
1292,1,4,Gay Lion,Rooaar.
1293,1,4,Big Gay Al,"And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!"
1294,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy."
1295,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?"
1296,1,4,Vocalist,"Oww, we can both be gay!"
1297,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!"
1298,1,4,Huddle,Break!
1299,1,4,Cowboy 1,You guys are toast.
1300,1,4,Cowboy 2,"Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in."
1301,1,4,Eric Cartman,We'll just see about that.
1302,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Set, set."
1303,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it Cartman!
1304,1,4,Chef,What's the matter?
1305,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman farted!
1306,1,4,Eric Cartman,No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
1307,1,4,Chef,Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
1308,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,No way dude!
1309,1,4,Chef,Hike! The! Ball!
1310,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, dude, weak."
1311,1,4,Eric Cartman,"That's right, you get back there."
1312,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hike!
1313,1,4,Frank Hammond,Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!
1314,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter."
1315,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Hell's bells.
1316,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King."
1317,1,4,Phil,"Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again."
1318,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that."
1319,1,4,Townsman 1,"We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo."
1320,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh."
1321,1,4,Vocalist,...both be gay.
1322,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?"
1323,1,4,Sparky,Ruff.
1324,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared."
1325,1,4,Sparky,Barr.
1326,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game."
1327,1,4,Stan Marsh,We can work on making you not gay together.
1328,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky?
1329,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Young man, it appears you still don't understand."
1330,1,4,Stan Marsh,What don't I understand?
1331,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Come this way, I have to show you something."
1332,1,4,Frank Hammond,"With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0."
1333,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hut, hut."
1334,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant."
1335,1,4,Phil,Dude! Now that is not cool.
1336,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Sorry, sorry."
1337,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride."
1338,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Step aboard, Stanley."
1339,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time."
1340,1,4,Frank Hammond,And the South Park Cows are set to receive...
1341,1,4,Frank Hammond,"There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick."
1342,1,4,Frank Hammond,"He's at the 50, the 40, the 30."
1343,1,4,Cowboys,"Hold him, hold him!"
1344,1,4,Cowboys,"Hold him, hold him!"
1345,1,4,Cowboy,Yaaah!
1346,1,4,Frank Hammond,The little running back is down. I think he's...
1347,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Yes, he's been decapitated."
1348,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
1349,1,4,Phil,"Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank."
1350,1,4,Frank Hammond,Ouch-a-roo!
1351,1,4,Chef,"Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!"
1352,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot."
1353,1,4,Big Gay Al,"You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan."
1354,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!"
1355,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely."
1356,1,4,Boat Ride Singers,"We're all gay, and it's okay,
'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.
We're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.
It's okay, hey, to be gay!"
1357,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Sooo, what do you think, Stan?"
1358,1,4,Stan Marsh,"This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand."
1359,1,4,Big Gay Al,[to himself] Isn't this precious?
1360,1,4,Frank Hammond,"And now, here to sing the touching song Loving You, is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother..."
1361,1,4,Audience Member,Alright Richard!
1362,1,4,Richard Stamos,"Loving you,
is easy cause you're beautiful,
-doo-n-doo-doo-doooo-
Aaaaah!"
1363,1,4,Richard Stamos,Aaaaah!
1364,1,4,Jimbo Kern,What the hell?!
1365,1,4,Richard Stamos,Aaaaah!
1366,1,4,Jimbo Kern,He didn't sing the high F!
1367,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this."
1368,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.
1369,1,4,Richard Stamos,Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...
1370,1,4,Mr Garrison,[heckling] It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
1371,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!"
1372,1,4,Sparky,Ruff!
1373,1,4,Big Gay Al,"No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?"
1374,1,4,Stan Marsh,"No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!"
1375,1,4,Big Gay Al,Oh Stan?
1376,1,4,Big Gay Al,"When you get back to town, [earnest music plays] tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately."
1377,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I will Big Gay Al, I will."
1378,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Ooh, my carrot cake! [rushes inside]"
1379,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hike!
1380,1,4,Frank Hammond,And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...
1381,1,4,Mr Garrison,"I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo."
1382,1,4,Mr Hat,"Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game."
1383,1,4,Townsman,"You're a dead man, Jimbo!"
1384,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Well, this should just about wrap it up for-"
1385,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Wait a minute, what's this?"
1386,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Yeah! Yohooooh!
1387,1,4,Frank Hammond,"It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback!"
1388,1,4,Chef,Where the hell have you been Stan?!
1389,1,4,Stan Marsh,I've been getting my best friend back.
1390,1,4,Chef,Just get in there boy!
1391,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Give 'em hell, Stanley!"
1392,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?"
1393,1,4,Jesus Christ,Leave me alone.
1394,1,4,Stan Marsh,Hike!
1395,1,4,Frank Hammond,Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
1396,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!"
1397,1,4,Stan Marsh,Mph!
1398,1,4,Frank Hammond,"And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!"
1399,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Oof.
1400,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!"
1401,1,4,Phil,Dude!
1402,1,4,Frank Hammond,Touchdown!
1403,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Yeah! Wooo!
1404,1,4,Frank Hammond,"The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!"
1405,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Yeah! Woohoo!
1406,1,4,Townsman,Speech!
1407,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?"
1408,1,4,Stan Marsh,Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
1409,1,4,Crowd,"Yeah, alright!"
1410,1,4,Stan Marsh,And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
1411,1,4,Crowd,Wooooh!
1412,1,4,Stan Marsh,And it's okay to be gay!
1413,1,4,Jimbo Kern,What?!
1414,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing."
1415,1,4,Mr Garrison,What the hell is he talking about?
1416,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?"
1417,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety."
1418,1,4,Stan Marsh,"It's true, I'll show you."
1419,1,4,Stan Marsh,But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
1420,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man."
1421,1,4,Townswoman,Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago!
1422,1,4,Townsperson 1,Sidney!
1423,1,4,Townsperson 2,Willy!
1424,1,4,Townsperson 3,Carlos!
1425,1,4,Big Gay Al,I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.
1426,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?"
1427,1,4,Big Gay Al,"I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done."
1428,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you."
1429,1,4,Stan Marsh,Wow!
1430,1,4,Richard Stamos,"You guys, you guys! I can do it."
1431,1,4,Mr Garrison,Do what?
1432,1,4,Richard Stamos,"Loving you,
Is easy cause you're beautiful,
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo"
1433,1,4,Jimbo Kern,No!
1434,1,4,Richard Stamos,Aaah!
1435,1,4,Enrique the Horse,Mroo-
1436,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?"
1437,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere."
1438,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Your sister beat you up again, huh?"
1439,1,5,Stan Marsh,No!
1440,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass."
1441,1,5,Stan Marsh,She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.
1442,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan."
1443,1,5,Eric Cartman,"I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"""
1444,1,5,Stan Marsh,"My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!"
1445,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Be a man Stan. Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."""
1446,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?"
1447,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,You mean this one?
1448,1,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
1449,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,He's my new pet elephant.
1450,1,5,Stan Marsh,Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?
1451,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three."
1452,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Wow, that's cool!"
1453,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch."
1454,1,5,Eric Cartman,That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
1455,1,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)"
1456,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants."
1457,1,5,Ms Crabtree,Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?
1458,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid."
1459,1,5,Ms Crabtree,Oh—I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.
1460,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya."
1461,1,5,Eric Cartman,"[Entering.] If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-"""
1462,1,5,Ms Crabtree,SIT DOWN KID!!!
1463,1,5,Eric Cartman,[Stung.] Yes ma'am.
1464,1,5,Mr Garrison,"And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering."
1465,1,5,Mr Hat,"That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better."
1466,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Garrison?
1467,1,5,Mr Garrison,Yes Kyle.
1468,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?"
1469,1,5,Mr Garrison,"Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes."
1470,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.
1471,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs."
1472,1,5,Stan Marsh,That'd be cool!
1473,1,5,Bebe Stevens,I want a pot-bellied elephant.
1474,1,5,Pip Pirrip,"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
1475,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,That's stupid.
1476,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want."
1477,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig."
1478,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,I'll bet you can't.
1479,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,Watch me plebeian.
1480,1,5,Mr Garrison,"Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war."
1481,1,5,Mr Hat,"Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people."
1482,1,5,Mr Garrison,"You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month."
1483,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!
1484,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Wait, wait. We still need a pig."
1485,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,We can use Cartman's pig.
1486,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!"
1487,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood."
1488,1,5,Eric Cartman,"You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!"
1489,1,5,Mr Garrison,"Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?"
1490,1,5,Stan Marsh,Okay.
1491,1,5,Mr Garrison,I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?
1492,1,5,Stan Marsh,[Despondantly.] Yes...
1493,1,5,Mr Garrison,"Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it."
1494,1,5,Mr Hat,"I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?"
1495,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, neither. It's my sister."
1496,1,5,Mr Garrison,"[Indignantly.] Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!"
1497,1,5,Jesus Christ,Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions...
1498,1,5,Shelly Marsh,Hey!
1499,1,5,Robert,"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
1500,1,5,Jesus Christ,"Yes, my son."
1501,1,5,Stan Marsh,Hi Shelly.
1502,1,5,Shelly Marsh,Are you looking at my headgear?
1503,1,5,Stan Marsh,Headgear? What headgear?
1504,1,5,Shelly Marsh,Are you looking at my headgear?
1505,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice."
1506,1,5,Shelly Marsh,You little liar.
1507,1,5,Stan Marsh,"No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!"
1508,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ready to go Stan?
1509,1,5,Stan Marsh,Go where?
1510,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
1511,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
1512,1,5,Eric Cartman,Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
1513,1,5,Shelly Marsh,I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
1514,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
1515,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"""
1516,1,5,Shelly Marsh,Who said that?
1517,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,This must be it.
1518,1,5,Eric Cartman,"[A bit wary.] Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time."
1519,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together."
1520,1,5,Eric Cartman,"It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you."
1521,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,It's just a stupid pig.
1522,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, quit being such a baby."
1523,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!"
1524,1,5,Stan Marsh,At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!
1525,1,5,Eric Cartman,Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
1526,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!"
1527,1,5,Eric Cartman,Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
1528,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!"
1529,1,5,Eric Cartman,I'll kick you in the nuts!
1530,1,5,Dr Alphonse Mephesto,Can I help you?
1531,1,5,Kenny McCormick,Mmmmmm!
1532,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
1533,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs."
1534,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets."
1535,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in."
1536,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
1537,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you."
1538,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses."
1539,1,5,Monkey,Mhhh.
1540,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,How does that make the world better?
1541,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose."
1542,1,5,Stan Marsh,Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
1543,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish."
1544,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings."
1545,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard."
1546,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?"
1547,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?"
1548,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Which song is that?
1549,1,6,Marsh Family,"Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear grandpa..."
1550,1,6,Marvin Grandpa Marsh,Uhhhhh.
1551,1,6,Marsh Family,...Happy birthday to you.
1552,1,6,Sharon Marsh,Now blow out the candles grandpa.
1553,1,6,Sharon Marsh,Hurray!!!
1554,1,6,Randy Marsh,"How's it feel to be 102, paps?"
1555,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Shoot me.
1556,1,6,Sharon Marsh,Make a wish grandpa.
1557,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,I wish I were dead
1558,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa."
1559,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old."
1560,1,6,Sharon Marsh,"Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?"
1561,1,6,Shelly Marsh,I will.
1562,1,6,Randy Marsh,Me.
1563,1,6,Stan Marsh,"It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on."
1564,1,6,Shelly Marsh,"That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid."
1565,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?"
1566,1,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you."
1567,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Aw, dammit!"
1568,1,6,Sharon Marsh,Language.
1569,1,6,TV Announcer,And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
1570,1,6,Phillip,"Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart."
1571,1,6,Terrance,"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb."
1572,1,6,Stan Marsh,Heheheh hehehe...
1573,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Uhhhhh
1574,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Ah, dammit!"
1575,1,6,Granpa,How would you like to make a dollar Billy?
1576,1,6,Stan Marsh,"My name's not Billy grandpa, it's Stan."
1577,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?"
1578,1,6,Stan Marsh,Sure.
1579,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
1580,1,6,Stan Marsh,I'm not gonna kill you grandpa.
1581,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Why not?
1582,1,6,Stan Marsh,"'Cause, I'll get in trouble."
1583,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,I killed my grandpa when I was your age.
1584,1,6,Stan Marsh,Leave me alone grandpa.
1585,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.
1586,1,6,Phillip,"Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too."
1587,1,6,Terrance,"Ohhh, you farted."
1588,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?"
1589,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?"
1590,1,6,Phillip,I sure would Terrance.
1591,1,6,Terrance,"Alrighty then, here's a two-lip."
1592,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,What is this?
1593,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,It's horrible!
1594,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip."
1595,1,6,Phillip,Take that you stupid dick.
1596,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,What did he say?
1597,1,6,Terrance,You're an asshole Phillip.
1598,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?
1599,1,6,Shiela,"Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!"
1600,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
1601,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Oh really? Is that so?
1602,1,6,Terrance,"Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart."
1603,1,6,Phillip,You're exactly right Terrance. Oh.
1604,1,6,Terrance,Oh no.
1605,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!"
1606,1,6,Liane Cartman,"Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth."
1607,1,6,Eric Cartman,That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
1608,1,6,Liane Cartman,"Ohhh, okay hon."
1609,1,6,Stan Marsh,I'm not going to kill you grandpa!
1610,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Ingrate!
1611,1,6,Stan Marsh,Good night grandpa.
1612,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,You pompous son of a whore!
1613,1,6,Student,"Huh huh, I had another ..."
1614,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Ow! What the hell was that for?!
1615,1,6,Eric Cartman,That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
1616,1,6,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?"
1617,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
1618,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!"
1619,1,6,Mr Garrison,Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
1620,1,6,Eric Cartman,"[Tauntingly.] Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?"
1621,1,6,Mr Garrison,"She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip."
1622,1,6,Class,"Yeahh, woohoo!"
1623,1,6,Mr Hat,"Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison."
1624,1,6,Mr Garrison,"That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds."
1625,1,6,Mr Garrison,"You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash."
1626,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Kenny, why are you late to class?"
1627,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Oh, okay Kenny, be seated."
1628,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because..."
1629,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Yes Kenny, what is it?"
1630,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(I have to go pee.)
1631,1,6,Mr Garrison,I thought you just came from the bathroom.
1632,1,6,Kenny McCormick,"(I did, I gotta go again...)"
1633,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Okay okay, go ahead."
1634,1,6,Mr Garrison,"As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment."
1635,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!"
1636,1,6,Mr Garrison,Pay attention children!
1637,1,6,Mr Garrison,"I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever."
1638,1,6,Eric Cartman,What?
1639,1,6,Clyde Donovan,Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?
1640,1,6,Mr Garrison,That's right children. Are there any questions?
1641,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Yes, Stanley?"
1642,1,6,Stan Marsh,Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
1643,1,6,Mr Garrison,"What, what do you mean?"
1644,1,6,Stan Marsh,"My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should."
1645,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna."
1646,1,6,Stan Marsh,Really??
1647,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all."
1648,1,6,Stan Marsh,Wow!
1649,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!"
1650,1,6,Stan Marsh,"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?"
1651,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole."
1652,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(Oh my God!)
1653,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(Owww!) [Splatterrrrr!]
1654,1,6,Eric Cartman,Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.
1655,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late."
1656,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,But won't your grandpa be there?
1657,1,6,Stan Marsh,Yeah...
1658,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money."
1659,1,6,Chef,Hello there children.
1660,1,6,Stan Marsh,Hey Chef.
1661,1,6,Chef,How's it goin'?
1662,1,6,Stan Marsh,Bad.
1663,1,6,Chef,Why bad?
1664,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?"
1665,1,6,Chef,"You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on."
1666,1,6,Stan Marsh,"No, I mean, kill my grandpa."
1667,1,6,Chef,"No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal."
1668,1,6,Stan Marsh,"See, I told you dude."
1669,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?"
1670,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?"
1671,1,6,Chef,I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
1672,1,6,Stan Marsh,What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
1673,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.
1674,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
1675,1,6,Phillip,What?
1676,1,6,Terrance,Fart.
1677,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny."
1678,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh."
1679,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
1680,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters."
1681,1,6,Townsman,"Ha ha, green apple splatters."
1682,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Uhhhh.
1683,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay."
1684,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet."
1685,1,6,Stan Marsh,"No grandpa, I'll get in trouble."
1686,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Kill me, God dammit!"
1687,1,6,Stan Marsh,"No, I can't even kill a deer."
1688,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?"
1689,1,6,Eric Cartman,I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
1690,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch."
1691,1,6,Eric Cartman,What!
1692,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,That's right.
1693,1,6,Stan Marsh,Grandpa!
1694,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too."
1695,1,6,Eric Cartman,Hey!
1696,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma."
1697,1,6,Eric Cartman,You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
1698,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,That's the spirit Tubby.
1699,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you."
1700,1,6,Eric Cartman,Don't talk about my mom like that!
1701,1,6,Stan Marsh,We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
1702,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?"
1703,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!"
1704,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes."
1705,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang."
1706,1,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die."
1707,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance."
1708,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, yeah!"
1709,1,6,TV Announcer,"And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access."
1710,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace."
1711,1,6,Jesus Christ,"First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'."
1712,1,6,Caller,"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
1713,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback."
1714,1,6,Caller,"Oh, sorry."
1715,1,6,Caller,"Uh, this is Martin..."
1716,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know."
1717,1,6,Martin,How the hell'd you know that?
1718,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?"
1719,1,6,Martin,"Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-"
1720,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance."
1721,1,6,Martin,"Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus."
1722,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Next caller, you're on the air."
1723,1,6,Stan Marsh,Jesus?
1724,1,6,Jesus Christ,Yes my son?
1725,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?"
1726,1,6,Jesus Christ,My son...
1727,1,6,Stan Marsh,Yes?
1728,1,6,Jesus Christ,I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.
1729,1,6,Jesus Christ,Next caller.

1742,1,6,Phillip,"Oho yeah, I love beans."
1743,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming."
1744,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa please?"
1745,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay grandpa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV."
1746,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart."
1747,1,6,Phillip,"Well, don't fart on me Terrance."
1748,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again."
1749,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(Oh my God!)
1750,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny."
1751,1,6,Phillip,"You're such an asshole, Terrance."
1752,1,6,Terrance,"Haha, that I am!"
1753,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(Ow!)
1754,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart."
1755,1,6,Shelly Marsh,Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
1756,1,6,Stan Marsh,"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it."
1757,1,6,Shelly Marsh,"No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!"
1758,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Tug - a - little harder, Billy."
1759,1,6,Stan Marsh,Aaah!!

1763,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Dammit! I was so close.
1764,1,6,TV Announcer,"Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather."
1765,1,6,Talk Show Host,"Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?"
1766,1,6,Stan Marsh,"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and..."
1767,1,6,Talk Show Host,"Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame."
1768,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!"
1769,1,6,Crowd,Woooo!
1770,1,6,Townsman,Huh? Oh god! Oh god!
1771,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!"
1772,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!"
1773,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"We want more quality television, like Full House."
1774,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison."
1775,1,6,Mr Garrison,"No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me."
1776,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh."
1777,1,6,Mayor McDaniels,I just had a brown baby boy.
1778,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around."
1779,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever."
1780,1,6,All,Whoopeee!
1781,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Come here Billy, I want to show you something."
1782,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Aww, do I have to?"
1783,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me..."
1784,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa."
1785,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what are you doing?!"
1786,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,What are they doing in there?
1787,1,6,Eric Cartman,I don't know.

1789,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Uh, I guess."
1790,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, you, you can let me out now."
1791,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Not just yet.
1792,1,6,Stan Marsh,Let me out grandpa!
1793,1,6,Stan Marsh,"I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time."
1794,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa."
1795,1,6,Singer,"'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'"
1796,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand."
1797,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,So now will you kill me Billy?
1798,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Sure I will grandpa, I will."
1799,1,6,Liane Cartman,"Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working."
1800,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"It'll work, it has to."
1801,1,6,Townsman,Look! It's the president of the network.
1802,1,6,John Warzog,"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network."
1803,1,6,John Warzog,Fuck you.
1804,1,6,John Warzog,"Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there."
1805,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Hey, you will not get away with this!"
1806,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'."
1807,1,6,Liane Cartman,"Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?"

1816,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"That's good Billy, a little higher now."
1817,1,6,Cow,Moooo!
1818,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?"
1819,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!"
1820,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes."

1830,1,6,All,Death!
1831,1,6,Death,Mrrrrr!
1832,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.
1833,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Come on, let's go."
1834,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,What the...?
1835,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, he's coming towards us."
1836,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Why is Death coming after us?
1837,1,6,Death,Mrrr.
1838,1,6,Kids,Ahhh!

1843,1,6,Newscaster,"As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors."
1844,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Here Carol, I think it's your boy."
1845,1,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?"
1846,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!"
1847,1,6,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there."
1848,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but, mom!"

1851,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, Death is coming!"
1852,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather."
1853,1,6,Death,Mrrrr!
1854,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place."
1855,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids."
1856,1,6,Kenny McCormick,"(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)"
1857,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Totally dude.
1858,1,6,Stan Marsh,Good point man.
1859,1,6,Death,Mrrrr!

1868,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Come over here you son of a whore!
1869,1,6,Phillip,"Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?"
1870,1,6,Terrance,"Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?"
1871,1,6,Phillip,"Oh, you farted."
1872,1,6,Terrance,Ohho God.
1873,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?"
1874,1,6,Phillip,"No Terrance, why don't you tell me?"
1875,1,6,Terrance,"Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!"
1876,1,6,Stan Marsh,[Noticing.] Hey look!
1877,1,6,Phillip,"Oh, there's one."
1878,1,6,Newscaster,"Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is..."
1879,1,6,Newscaster,"Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!"
1880,1,6,Townsman,"Wait, wait."
1881,1,6,John Warzog,"Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked."
1882,1,6,John Warzog,"Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers."
1883,1,6,John Warzog,"Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!"
1884,1,6,Townsman,"Huh, oh no!"
1885,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"At last, now we can return to normality."
1886,1,6,Terrance,Hey Phillip.
1887,1,6,Phillip,Yes Terrance?
1888,1,6,Terrance,Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
1889,1,6,Phillip,"Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check."
1890,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on."
1891,1,6,TV Announcer,We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.
1892,1,6,Death,Mrrrrr!
1893,1,6,Kids,Ahhh!
1894,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!"
1895,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time."
1896,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Hey, you were supposed to kill me!"
1897,1,6,Death,Mrrr.
1898,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it."
1899,1,6,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
1900,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,Billllyyyy...
1901,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Grandpa?
1902,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,"That's right, Billy."
1903,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?"
1904,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,"I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo."
1905,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Limbo?
1906,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,"I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes."
1907,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,But I've been waiting for 25 years.
1908,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,"Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes..."
1909,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on you guys, let's go home."
1910,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Here they are!
1911,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won."
1912,1,6,Stan Marsh,What do you mean?
1913,1,6,Sharon Marsh,We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.
1914,1,6,Eric Cartman,"You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!"
1915,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,But look what they put on.
1916,1,6,TV Announcer,And now back to She's the Sheriff.
1917,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Ohhh, God, No!"
1918,1,6,Suzanne Somers,You are the one behind all these shenanigans.
1919,1,6,Dude,"Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it."
1920,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,What did he say?
1921,1,6,Suzanne Sommers,"Up yours, butt-munch."
1922,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat!!!
1923,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Come on everybody, back to New York!"
1924,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?"
1925,1,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes."
1926,1,6,Eric Cartman,My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
1927,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?"
1928,1,6,Stan Marsh,Cool!
1929,1,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
1930,1,6,Stan Marsh,What are you doing grandpa?
1931,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?

1961,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"What uh, what are you supposed to be?"
1962,1,7,Stan Marsh,I'm Raggedy Andy.
1963,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
1964,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure."
1965,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
1966,1,7,Stan Marsh,Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.

2013,1,7,Stan Marsh,You what?!
2014,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca."
2015,1,7,Bill Allen,Heheh. Heheh.
2016,1,7,Fosse McDonald,"Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss."
2017,1,7,Bill Allen,"Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh."
2018,1,7,Fosse McDonald,Yehaha.
2019,1,7,Bill Allen,Huhuh.
2020,1,7,Eric Cartman,"There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?"
2021,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!"
2022,1,7,Eric Cartman,You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
2023,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Wookies don't live on Endor!
2024,1,7,Eric Cartman,[In a mocking voice.] Wookies don't live on Endor.
2025,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
2026,1,7,Eric Cartman,What?! What did you say?
2027,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel-"
2028,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Eww.
2029,1,7,Mr Garrison,Is there a problem Kenny?
2030,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?"
2031,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
2032,1,7,Liane,"Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things..."
2033,1,7,Liane,Hello there!
2034,1,7,Zombie,Uuuhh.
2035,1,7,Liane,Happy Halloween!
2036,1,7,Zombie Mortician,Must eat brains.
2037,1,7,Liane,"It's the most wonderful time of the year,
do do do do do do do do-"
2038,1,7,Passer by,Aaargh!!! Oh my God!!!
2039,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
2040,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? [As Kenny.] No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like. [As himself.] Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you."
2041,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Aren't you hungry Kenny?
2042,1,7,Stan Marsh,"He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything."
2043,1,7,Chef,Hello children.
2044,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Chef.
2045,1,7,Stan Marsh,Hey Chef.
2046,1,7,Chef,What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
2047,1,7,Eric Cartman,Eating Kenny's pudding.
2048,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef."
2049,1,7,Chef,Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
2050,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?"
2051,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!"
2052,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!"
2053,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself."
2054,1,7,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool."
2055,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Where did you get that costume, young man?!"
2056,1,7,Eric Cartman,"My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!"
2057,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Sshh! Oh, God bless America."
2058,1,7,Principal Victoria,You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
2059,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o."
2060,1,7,Clyde Donovan,"Owww, you bit my arm!"
2061,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[Pleased.] Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal."
2062,1,7,Principal Victoria,Watch the video Eric.
2063,1,7,Narrator,"Adolph Hitler was a very, very naughty man."
2064,1,7,Adolf Hitler,Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brüder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa-
2065,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!"
2066,1,7,Puffy the Bear,"So remember kids, dressing like Hitler in school isn't cool!"
2067,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Now, do you have any questions?"
2068,1,7,Eric Cartman,[Gleefully.] Could I see that again? That was cool.
2069,1,7,Principal Victoria,"You must remove that costume, immediately!"
2070,1,7,Eric Cartman,"I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy."
2071,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now."
2072,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?"
2073,1,7,Eric Cartman,[Whining.] I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
2074,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man."
2075,1,7,Jogger,"Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around."
2076,1,7,Eric Cartman,Boo! I'm a ghost.
2077,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh man, I feel like a total choad."
2078,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad."
2079,1,7,Chef,"Hello, children."
2080,1,7,Eric Cartman,Hey Chef.
2081,1,7,Chef,Aaaaah!
2082,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?"
2083,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, where's Kyle?"
2084,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Check this out!
2085,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude!"
2086,1,7,Eric Cartman,What is that?
2087,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
2088,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes."
2089,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers."
2090,1,7,Eric Cartman,Who?
2091,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I thought she was dead."
2092,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, me too."
2093,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume."
2094,1,7,Mr Garrison,"...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!"
2095,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!"
2096,1,7,Mr Garrison,"And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children. [Everyone laughs.] Yeah."
2097,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!"
2098,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
2099,1,7,Stan Marsh,I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
2100,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe."
2101,1,7,Mr Garrison,"That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing."
2102,1,7,Clyde Donovan,Brainnns. Ahh.
2103,1,7,Mr Garrison,Wait your turn Clyde.
2104,1,7,Johnson,Uuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!
2105,1,7,Chef,"Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?"
2106,1,7,Johnson,Piiink eyyye.
2107,1,7,Chef,Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye!
2108,1,7,Tom,"...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, ""Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station."""
2109,1,7,Tom,"In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini."
2110,1,7,Midget wearing a Bikini,"Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus."
2111,1,7,Midget wearing a Bikini,"Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes."
2112,1,7,Chef,Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
2113,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him."
2114,1,7,Stan Marsh,I bet I get more candy than you dude.
2115,1,7,Eric Cartman,Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
2116,1,7,Stan Marsh,"No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference."
2117,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking."
2118,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!"
2119,1,7,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!"
2120,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey dudes.
2121,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight..."
2122,1,7,Eric Cartman,Check.
2123,1,7,Stan Marsh,Plastic pumpkin pails...
2124,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Check.
2125,1,7,Stan Marsh,Taser...
2126,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
2127,1,7,Stan Marsh,"For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something."
2128,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, granola pisses me off."
2129,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Kenny.
2130,1,7,Stan Marsh,Hey Kenny.
2131,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny."
2132,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,You still didn't get a costume Kenny?
2133,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire."
2134,1,7,Eric Cartman,"I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!"
2135,1,7,Eric Cartman,"I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate."
2136,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Hi guys.
2137,1,7,Eric Cartman,Hi Wendy.
2138,1,7,Stan Marsh,[Pointedly.] How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
2139,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi."
2140,1,7,Eric Cartman,You what?! Are you insane?!
2141,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Let's go trick-or-treats.
2142,1,7,Stan Marsh,"I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day."
2143,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad."
2144,1,7,Eric Cartman,How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
2145,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!"
2146,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,But Stan!
2147,1,7,Stan Marsh,"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!"
2148,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,AAAAAAAAAAAH!
2149,1,7,Chef,Doctor!
2150,1,7,Doctor,"Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?"
2151,1,7,Chef,"No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead."
2152,1,7,Doctor,What the hell are you talking about?
2153,1,7,Chef,"Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!"
2154,1,7,Doctor,"Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream."
2155,1,7,Chef,"Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!"
2156,1,7,Mr Torres,Aaah!
2157,1,7,Doctor,"Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef."
2158,1,7,Chef,"Oh, sorry."
2159,1,7,Chef,"But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here."
2160,1,7,Doctor,"Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years."
2161,1,7,Chef,"Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?"
2162,1,7,Doctor,"Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah."
2163,1,7,Chef,Aaaaaaaaaah!
2164,1,7,Doctor,"Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody."
2165,1,7,Doctor,Ahh!
2166,1,7,The Boys,Trick-or-treat!
2167,1,7,Elderly Woman,"Ohh, how cute."
2168,1,7,Elderly Woman,Aaah!
2169,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Kenny!"
2170,1,7,Elderly Woman,"Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911!"
2171,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy."
2172,1,7,Elderly Woman,Call 911!
2173,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops."
2174,1,7,Eric Cartman,"You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!"
2175,1,7,Chef,"Mayor, we've got a big problem."
2176,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,Ugh!
2177,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Why, why Chef. What a surprise!"
2178,1,7,Officer Barbrady,You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
2179,1,7,Chef,"Actually, uh-"
2180,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia."
2181,1,7,Officer Barbrady,[Wagging his finger.] Not a thingy-dingy.
2182,1,7,Chef,I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
2183,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,"You mean, Tina Yothers?"
2184,1,7,Chef,"No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!"
2185,1,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?"
2186,1,7,Chef,"[Pissed.] Aw, the hell with you both!"
2187,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, let's get back to it."
2188,1,7,Officer Barbrady,Righty-o.
2189,1,7,The Boys,Trick-or-treat.
2190,1,7,Dude,Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies.
2191,1,7,Dude,Aaah!
2192,1,7,Dude,Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah!
2193,1,7,Eric Cartman,Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
2194,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!"
2195,1,7,Somebody,"Oh, God!"
2196,1,7,The Boys,Trick-or-treat.
2197,1,7,Eric Cartman,Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.
2198,1,7,Eric Cartman,One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
2199,1,7,Female,Oh my God!
2200,1,7,Female,Oh my God!
2201,1,7,Female,Nooo!
2202,1,7,The Boys,Trick-or-t-Aaah!
2203,1,7,Chef,Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
2204,1,7,The Boys,"Hey, Chef, trick-"
2205,1,7,Stan Marsh,Chef! No!
2206,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Chef! No!
2207,1,7,Chef,"[Suddenly calm.] Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them."
2208,1,7,Eric Cartman,Can we have some candy now please?!
2209,1,7,Chef,"Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!"
2210,1,7,Eric Cartman,I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
2211,1,7,Chef,"Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!"
2212,1,7,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about Chef?
2213,1,7,Chef,Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
2214,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains."
2215,1,7,Chef,"Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town."
2216,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, that means..."
2217,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,If everyone is turned into zombies...
2218,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!"
2219,1,7,Eric Cartman,Aaah!
2220,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, you've gotta help us!"
2221,1,7,Chef,I'm working on it children.
2222,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Wait, where are we going?"
2223,1,7,Chef,"The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue."
2224,1,7,Eric Cartman,It was Kyle.
2225,1,7,Stan Marsh,I don't know about this Chef.
2226,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I'm scared."
2227,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Remember candy, focus on the candy."
2228,1,7,Stan Marsh,What are we doing here Chef?
2229,1,7,Chef,Just look for anything suspicious.
2230,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,I found it! I found it!
2231,1,7,Stan Marsh,What?
2232,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"See Cartman, your mom is on the cover."
2233,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh, shit..."
2234,1,7,Stan Marsh,We told you dude.
2235,1,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys, shit..."
2236,1,7,Chef,You better let me take that Kyle.
2237,1,7,Stan Marsh,Hey Chef. Look

2239,1,7,Pip Pirrip,Piiink eye!
2240,1,7,Eric Cartman,It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
2241,1,7,Pip Pirrip,Aaah!
2242,1,7,Chef,Look out children!
2243,1,7,Zombie,"Ow, ooh, ow, gowuh-"
2244,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?"
2245,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Chef!!!
2246,1,7,Chef,"I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid."
2247,1,7,Stan Marsh,Let's get out of here!
2248,1,7,Chef,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
2249,1,7,Stan Marsh,We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
2250,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, there's a pay phone!"
2251,1,7,Stan Marsh,You call the number Kyle.
2252,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,But the zombies are coming!

2255,1,7,Eric Cartman,Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!
2256,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Aaah, kew!"
2257,1,7,Stan Marsh,Sweet!
2258,1,7,Hotline Voice,"Worcestershire sauce emergency hotline, this call might be monitored to ensure you the highest quality service, how may I help you?"
2259,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,There's a bunch of zombies here!
2260,1,7,Hotline Voice,Please hold.
2261,1,7,Stan Marsh,Wendy?
2262,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Aaahahah!
2263,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!"
2264,1,7,Stan Marsh,"I know, but uh-... but..."
2265,1,7,Eric Cartman,Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
2266,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, yeah!"
2267,1,7,Hotline Voice,"For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!"
2268,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, okay. Then what?"
2269,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Aaahh.
2270,1,7,Stan Marsh,"[Apologetically.] Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it."
2271,1,7,Eric Cartman,Kill her Stan!
2272,1,7,Hotline Voice,"All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal."
2273,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!"
2274,1,7,Hotline Voice,"We realize you have a choice in worcestershire sauces, we are delighted that..."
2275,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary."
2276,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Aaah!
2277,1,7,Stan Marsh,"I, I can't."
2278,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Aaah!
2279,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
2280,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh, what happened? Stan?"
2281,1,7,Stan Marsh,Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
2282,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,It's working! They're turning back to normal.
2283,1,7,Chef,You did it children!
2284,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!"
2285,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
2286,1,7,Stan Marsh,"That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead."
2287,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.
2288,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!"
2289,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh man, I can't believe he's gone."
2290,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us."
2291,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw."
2292,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way."
2293,1,7,Stan Marsh,"You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving."
2294,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"...No, dude, that's Christmas."
2295,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh, then, what's Halloween about?"
2296,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Costumes and candy.
2297,1,7,Stan Marsh,Oh.
2298,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, let's go home, start eating that candy."
2299,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom."
2300,1,7,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2301,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money."
2302,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month."
2303,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Lehh, eh, screw you guys!"
2304,1,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass.)"
2305,1,7,Kenny McCormick,(Ow!)
2306,1,8,Stan Marsh,That was awesome!
2307,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
2308,1,8,Liane Cartman,Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
2309,1,8,Eric Cartman,Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
2310,1,8,Liane Cartman,Sure hon.
2311,1,8,Eric Cartman,"And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!"
2312,1,8,Phillip,Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
2313,1,8,Terrance,It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.
2314,1,8,Phillip,AAAAAH!
2315,1,8,Phillip,Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
2316,1,8,Eric Cartman,Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
2317,1,8,TV Announcer,"Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs."
2318,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, cool."
2319,1,8,TV Announcer,And now a word from our sponsor.
2320,1,8,Sally Struthers,"Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help."
2321,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, who's that fat chick?"
2322,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House."
2323,1,8,Stan Marsh,Oh.
2324,1,8,Sally Struthers,"You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce."
2325,1,8,Stan Marsh,Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
2326,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman."
2327,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, HEY!"
2328,1,8,Sally Struthers,For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.
2329,1,8,Eric Cartman,"That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?"
2330,1,8,Sally Struthers,Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.
2331,1,8,Eric Cartman,KICK ASS!!
2332,1,8,Stan Marsh,SWEET!
2333,1,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
2334,1,8,Stan Marsh,I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
2335,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Did they say if it's waterproof?
2336,1,8,Stan Marsh,Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?
2337,1,8,Stan Marsh,Oh.
2338,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,What did she say?
2339,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear."
2340,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Ass-rammer.
2341,1,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
2342,1,8,Eric Cartman,When do we get the sports watch?
2343,1,8,Stan Marsh,Just a second fat-ass!
2344,1,8,Eric Cartman,You vas-deferens!
2345,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Hello? No, no, it's a ma- [To his friends, confused.] Vas-deferens?"
2346,1,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)"
2347,1,8,Stan Marsh,Oh.
2348,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Ask her if we get the watch right away.
2349,1,8,Stan Marsh,Do we get the sports watch right away?
2350,1,8,Stan Marsh,She says we do.
2351,1,8,All,Cool.
2352,1,8,Eric Cartman,"I get to wear it first, you guys."
2353,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
2354,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said."
2355,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?"
2356,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Yes, Eric?"
2357,1,8,Eric Cartman,When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
2358,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people."
2359,1,8,Mr Garrison,A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
2360,1,8,Stan Marsh,"You mean, like Kenny?"
2361,1,8,Mr Garrison,Exactly.
2362,1,8,Eric Cartman,Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
2363,1,8,Mr Garrison,"[Impatiently.] I don't know Eric, they just do."
2364,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people."
2365,1,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!"
2366,1,8,Wendy Testaburger,Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
2367,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!"
2368,1,8,Wendy Testaburger,This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
2369,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!"
2370,1,8,Wendy Testaburger,Many would rather die than go to those places!
2371,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!"
2372,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?"
2373,1,8,Mr Hat,"That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?"
2374,1,8,Clyde Donovan,Aaaah!
2375,1,8,Mr Garrison,What the hell is going on?!
2376,1,8,Clyde Donovan,Aaaah!
2377,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, you don't see that everyday."
2378,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor."
2379,1,8,Aide 2,It should be something festive.
2380,1,8,Mephesto,"Mayor, we've got a very big problem."
2381,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?"
2382,1,8,Mephesto,"Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving."
2383,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,[Warily.] Uh huh.
2384,1,8,Mephesto,"You know, to provide food for the needy."
2385,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,[Sarcastically.] Of course.
2386,1,8,Mephesto,"Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off."
2387,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Naturally.
2388,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, do go on."
2389,1,8,Mephesto,"We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short."
2390,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,You were saying?
2391,1,8,Mephesto,"They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil."
2392,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"[With feigned shock.] Oh, my!"
2393,1,8,Mephesto,Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.
2394,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Uh now why would you say that?
2395,1,8,Everybody,Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?
2396,1,8,Eric Cartman,"I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?"
2397,1,8,Liane Cartman,[Peeks.] Not yet hon.
2398,1,8,Stan Marsh,Damn.
2399,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look you guys."
2400,1,8,TV Announcer,"And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special."
2401,1,8,Terrance,"I sure am cold, Phillip."
2402,1,8,Phillip,"Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass."
2403,1,8,Terrance,"Gosh, I hope we don't starve."
2404,1,8,Phillip,"Ah, a squeaker!"
2405,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,The digital sports watch is here.
2406,1,8,Eric Cartman,What the hell?
2407,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that's not a digital sports watch."
2408,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians."
2409,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch."
2410,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.
2411,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! That was cool.
2412,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?"
2413,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,What's your name dude?
2414,1,8,Kid,Mabin.
2415,1,8,Stan Marsh,I think he said his name is Marvin.
2416,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Starvin' Marvin."
2417,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
2418,1,8,Eric Cartman,Hey mooom?
2419,1,8,Liane Cartman,Yes hon?
2420,1,8,Eric Cartman,"We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?"
2421,1,8,Liane Cartman,"Sure, hon."
2422,1,8,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
2423,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow."
2424,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother."
2425,1,8,Eric Cartman,No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
2426,1,8,Stan Marsh,It was my mom's credit card.
2427,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me."
2428,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor."
2429,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Totally.
2430,1,8,Eric Cartman,Ahh!
2431,1,8,Woman,Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
2432,1,8,Man,Not as beautiful as you.
2433,1,8,Woman,[Swooning.] Ooooh.
2434,1,8,Man,"Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys."
2435,1,8,Woman,"Oohh, they're so beautiful."
2436,1,8,Man,Not as beautiful as you.
2437,1,8,Woman,"Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer."
2438,1,8,Man,Not as beautiful as-
2439,1,8,Stan Marsh,This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
2440,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income."
2441,1,8,Eric Cartman,Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
2442,1,8,Eric Cartman,"You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers."
2443,1,8,Marvin,Ap-ee-tizer.
2444,1,8,Eric Cartman,"This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry."
2445,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers."
2446,1,8,Eric Cartman,"No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie."
2447,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share."
2448,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right."
2449,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive."
2450,1,8,Mr Garrison,And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?
2451,1,8,Mr Garrison,Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.
2452,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell."
2453,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, yeah, we do!"
2454,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that's right."
2455,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,We do!
2456,1,8,Mr Garrison,"All right boys, show us what you've brought."
2457,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin."
2458,1,8,Stan Marsh,He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
2459,1,8,Eric Cartman,"No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn."
2460,1,8,Eric Cartman,"No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!"
2461,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?"
2462,1,8,Stan Marsh,He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
2463,1,8,Mr Garrison,The sports watch from the commercial?
2464,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that one."
2465,1,8,Bebe Stevens,I want a Starvin' Marvin.
2466,1,8,Clyde Donovan,Me too.
2467,1,8,Pip Pirrip,"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
2468,1,8,Class,"Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me."
2469,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned."
2470,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude."
2471,1,8,Principal Victoria,"Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now."
2472,1,8,Principal Victoria,"Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson."
2473,1,8,Stan Marsh,No.
2474,1,8,Principal Victoria,You can't care for this child!
2475,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
2476,1,8,Principal Victoria,"Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park."
2477,1,8,Stan Marsh,So why can't he live here now?
2478,1,8,Principal Victoria,Because he can't!
2479,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Because why?
2480,1,8,Principal Victoria,Because eight-year olds can't be parents!
2481,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Then you take care of him.
2482,1,8,Principal Victoria,"[on the spot] I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy."
2483,1,8,Principal Victoria,"I send my five dollars a month, see?"
2484,1,8,Stan Marsh,"This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend."
2485,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh well, back to the poor country with you."
2486,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
2487,1,8,Eric Cartman,"B-huh, huh. Yeah, right."
2488,1,8,Mephesto,I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.
2489,1,8,Chef,"Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees."
2490,1,8,Mephesto,Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.
2491,1,8,Chef,"Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts."
2492,1,8,Mephesto,"Oh, whoops."
2493,1,8,Mephesto,Now tell me what you see.
2494,1,8,Chef,"Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA."
2495,1,8,Mephesto,"Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing."
2496,1,8,Chef,What does it mean?
2497,1,8,Mephesto,"Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world."
2498,1,8,Chef,"Oh, fudge!"
2499,1,8,Chef,"Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again."
2500,1,8,Mephesto,Sure.
2501,1,8,Agent 1,"Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch."
2502,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, hey, what's going on?!"
2503,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!"
2504,1,8,Agent 1,"Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up."
2505,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!"
2506,1,8,Marvin,Sweet.
2507,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,So how does this thing work?
2508,1,8,Aide,"Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family."
2509,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,POVVVV?
2510,1,8,Aide,Poverty stricken citizen.
2511,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Ohhoho, brilliant."
2512,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Daah!! What the hell is this!!
2513,1,8,Aide,"I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program."
2514,1,8,Mephesto,They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.
2515,1,8,Chef,"It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!"
2516,1,8,Chef,"Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!"
2517,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
2518,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!"
2519,1,8,Mephesto,We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!
2520,1,8,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?"
2521,1,8,Phillip,"Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon."
2522,1,8,Terrance,"Huh, eh,"
2523,1,8,Terrance,wait wait wait.
2524,1,8,Terrance,"Eh, eh."
2525,1,8,Terrance,"Here it comes, ehhhh."
2526,1,8,Terrance,"Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!"
2527,1,8,Phillip,Aaaah.
2528,1,8,Phillip,I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.
2529,1,8,Terrance,I spattered his face!
2530,1,8,Phillip,Now he's a smelly Indian.
2531,1,8,TV Announcer,"We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this."
2532,1,8,Sally Struthers,Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.
2533,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!"
2534,1,8,Sally Struthers,"So please, call and adopt a child today."
2535,1,8,Eric Cartman,I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
2536,1,8,Liane Cartman,You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?
2537,1,8,Marvin,"Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof."
2538,1,8,Liane Cartman,Okay.
2539,1,8,Marvin,Sweet.
2540,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere."
2541,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?"
2542,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, screw you too!"
2543,1,8,Eric Cartman,What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
2544,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa."
2545,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, where's Cartman?"
2546,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?"
2547,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.
2548,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Come on, hurry up."
2549,1,8,Mrs McCormick,Grab a lot son.
2550,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!
2551,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!"
2552,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kenny!"
2553,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Kenny!"
2554,1,8,Stuart McCormick,"Come on, son!"
2555,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family."
2556,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe.
2557,1,8,Chef,What the-?!
2558,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!"
2559,1,8,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos."
2560,1,8,Mephesto,"I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen."
2561,1,8,Chef,"Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your..."
2562,1,8,Chef,What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
2563,1,8,Mephesto,That's not important right now.
2564,1,8,Chef,No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
2565,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Chef, the turkeys!"
2566,1,8,Chef,"Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!"
2567,1,8,Chef,We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
2568,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat."
2569,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!"
2570,1,8,Eric Cartman,I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
2571,1,8,Red Cross Dude,"Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding."
2572,1,8,Eric Cartman,What?!
2573,1,8,Red Cross Dude,"We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up."
2574,1,8,Eric Cartman,But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
2575,1,8,Red Cross Dude,"Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch."
2576,1,8,Eric Cartman,WEEEEEEAK!!!
2577,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys."
2578,1,8,Townsperson 1,There's too many of them.
2579,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!
2580,1,8,Townsperson 2,We can't stop them.
2581,1,8,Chef,"Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!"
2582,1,8,Crowd,"Wooo, yeahhh, woo."
2583,1,8,Leader Turkey,"Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!"
2584,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Here you go turkeys!
2585,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Does my hair look okay?
2586,1,8,Eric Cartman,Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
2587,1,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh."
2588,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err."
2589,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Huh, I wonder what's in here?"
2590,1,8,Eric Cartman,SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!
2591,1,8,Eric Cartman,Sally Struthers?!
2592,1,8,Sally Struthers,Who the hell are you?!
2593,1,8,Eric Cartman,Gimme that cake!
2594,1,8,Sally Struthers,"Nooho, this is my cake!"
2595,1,8,Eric Cartman,"No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!"
2596,1,8,Sally Struthers,NOO! You can't have any!
2597,1,8,Eric Cartman,"No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!"
2598,1,8,Eric Cartman,"You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!"
2599,1,8,Sally Struthers,Uh oh.
2600,1,8,Chef,Stay close children.
2601,1,8,Stan Marsh,Yeaaa!
2602,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeaaa!
2603,1,8,Kenny McCormick,Yeaaa!
2604,1,8,Kenny McCormick,(O-Oh.)
2605,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!"
2606,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
2607,1,8,Jimbo,"The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned."
2608,1,8,Stan Marsh,We did it!!
2609,1,8,Mephesto,"My God, what have we done?"
2610,1,8,Chef,We've saved Thanksgiving!
2611,1,8,Mephesto,"But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead."
2612,1,8,Chef,"Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives."
2613,1,8,Mephesto,"As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-"
2614,1,8,Chef,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2615,1,8,Agent 2,"Excuse me sir, we're looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch."
2616,1,8,Agent 1,Have you seen anyone fitting this description.
2617,1,8,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister."
2618,1,8,Agent 1,There you are. Are you ready to go home now?
2619,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Wow, it sucks he has to leave."
2620,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman."
2621,1,8,Stan Marsh,"You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people."
2622,1,8,Stan Marsh,"But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I."
2623,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
2624,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
2625,1,8,Red Cross Chick,We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.
2626,1,8,Eric Cartman,"That's right you will, God-Damnit."
2627,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Move it POVs, I'm an American!"
2628,1,8,Ethiopian,"A baba, gluck gluck bababab ga."
2629,1,8,Marvin,Baba gook gook ba.
2630,1,8,Sally Struthers,(What are you doing? Let me off of here!)
2631,1,8,Stuart McCormick,"Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us, and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen."
2632,1,8,Mrs McCormick,Amen.
2633,1,8,Mrs McCormick,Does anybody have a can opener?
2634,1,8,Stuart McCormick,God Damn-it.
2635,1,9,Class,"We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year!"
2636,1,9,Stan Marsh,"Lights, please."
2637,1,9,Stan Marsh,"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,
keeping watch over their flocks by night.
And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them,
and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them,
'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy,
for born unto you this day in the city of
...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace,
goodwill towards men'

And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus."
2638,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,Unh [labored breathing] Oh!
2639,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Mary! Push!"
2640,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,Aaaah!
2641,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,I can see its head!
2642,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,UUuuhh-UUuuhh.
2643,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's a boy!
2644,1,9,Eric Cartman,Oohhhh!
2645,1,9,Kenny McCormick,(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)
2646,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you?"
2647,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,...Sorry.
2648,1,9,Mr Garrison,"And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains."
2649,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,Okay.
2650,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!"
2651,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head."
2652,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,How dare you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?!
2653,1,9,Mr Garrison,...So?
2654,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
2655,1,9,Mr Garrison,Because it's Christmas???
2656,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
2657,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you?"
2658,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!"
2659,1,9,Eric Cartman,Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
2660,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, fat boy!"
2661,1,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm not fat, I'm festively plump."
2662,1,9,Stan Marsh,"Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?"
2663,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?"
2664,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"How about the dreidel song, bubbe?"
2665,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
2666,1,9,Mr Garrison,The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
2667,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-"
2668,1,9,Stan Marsh,Christmas Poo?
2669,1,9,Eric Cartman,What the hell is Christmas Poo?
2670,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?"
2671,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, that is enough!"
2672,1,9,Mr Garrison,"See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan."
2673,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison."
2674,1,9,Mr Garrison,Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark?
2675,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,"You guys, look! It's snowing!"
2676,1,9,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, Christmas snow!"
2677,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.
2678,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,It's fun.
2679,1,9,Kenny McCormick,P'tooui.
2680,1,9,Stan Marsh,"That was sick, dude!"
2681,1,9,Eric Cartman,Hey!
2682,1,9,Eric Cartman,What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
2683,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"We can, too!"
2684,1,9,Stan Marsh,"...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude."
2685,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Officer Barbrady!
2686,1,9,Officer Barbrady,What?
2687,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
2688,1,9,Officer Barbrady,Yyess.
2689,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Damnit!
2690,1,9,Stan Marsh,Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
2691,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents."
2692,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,No. But I get Hanukkah presents for eight days.
2693,1,9,Eric Cartman,Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
2694,1,9,Stan Marsh,"We'll catch up with you later, Kyle."
2695,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo."
2696,1,9,Stan Marsh,"Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?"
2697,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
2698,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now."
2699,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well! You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!"
2700,1,9,Eric Cartman,"You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle."
2701,1,9,Stan Marsh,"See you around, dude."
2702,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas..."
2703,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas."
2704,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down."
2705,1,9,Large woman,"Mayor, we are deeply offended by the Nativity scene in front of the capital office. Church and State are separate!"
2706,1,9,Some men,No! Wrong!
2707,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"What's going on, you guys?"
2708,1,9,Stan Marsh,The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet.
2709,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!"
2710,1,9,Mr Garrison,You are the Jewish community!
2711,1,9,Crowd,Yeah! Yeah!
2712,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!"
2713,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
2714,1,9,Father Maxi,"Mayor, the Nativity is what Christmas is all about. If you remove Christ, you must remove Santa and Frosty and all of that garbage, too!"
2715,1,9,Woman,Hallelujah!
2716,1,9,Man,Amen!
2717,1,9,Tree hugger,And we must put a stop to the cutting down of Christmas trees!
2718,1,9,Man 1,Raah!
2719,1,9,Man 2,Give me a break!
2720,1,9,Uncle Jimbo,"And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids. If you don't want to spill your coffee, you shouldn't be driving with it."
2721,1,9,Crowd,Yeah! Yeah!
2722,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise. Perhaps we need a new icon for Christmas."
2723,1,9,Assistant 1,"Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor!"
2724,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?"
2725,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,Ex-cuse me?
2726,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
2727,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle! Sshhh!
2728,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's true. He doesn't care what faith you are. 
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-"
2729,1,9,Eric Cartman,[stopping Kyle] Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy.
2730,1,9,Kenny McCormick,(Kyle's crazy!)
2731,1,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2732,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww."
2733,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Wait...
2734,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions?"
2735,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, Mr. Garrison."
2736,1,9,Mr Garrison,Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?
2737,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,"No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans."
2738,1,9,Mr Garrison,Rats!
2739,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,"It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!"
2740,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Your father's right, Kyle."
2741,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!"
2742,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Listen to your father, Kyle."
2743,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'."
2744,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"But dad, he always sh..."
2745,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,Say it!
2746,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
2747,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,Again!
2748,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
2749,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"This is for your own good, bubbe."
2750,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!"
2751,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[softly, under his breath] Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway."
2752,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,What did you say?!
2753,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,I said Ike's on fire!
2754,1,9,Ike,Oh oh. On flame? Oh oh. On flame?
2755,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,Oh my God!
2756,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast!
2757,1,9,Voice,Kyle.
2758,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not hearing that.
2759,1,9,Voice,Kyle.
2760,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey?
2761,1,9,Mr Hankey,Howwwwdy-hoooo.
2762,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell."
2763,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[now wary] Go away, Mr. Hankey."
2764,1,9,Mr Hankey,"You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers."
2765,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,I said go away! My father said you aren't real.
2766,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song?"
2767,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'."
2768,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
2769,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'."
2770,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, what are you doing in there?"
2771,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Nothing.
2772,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,Open this door!
2773,1,9,Mr Hankey,"I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we..."
2774,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Hankey, come here."
2775,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,KYLE!
2776,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Say something, Mr. Hankey!"
2777,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!"
2778,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?!
2779,1,9,Mr Hankey,Howdy-ho!
2780,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?
2781,1,9,Mr Hankey,"You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold."
2782,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Nobody believes in you, not even my friends."
2783,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Aw, gee, that's too bad."
2784,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends."
2785,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas."
2786,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! We'll show them!
2787,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!"
2788,1,9,Uncle Jimbo,Is mistletoe offensive?
2789,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,Is anyone offended by mistletoe?
2790,1,9,Mayor McDaniels,Lose the mistletoe!
2791,1,9,Stan Marsh,You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
2792,1,9,Eric Cartman,How do you know?
2793,1,9,Stan Marsh,'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
2794,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000."
2795,1,9,Stan Marsh,What's that?
2796,1,9,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet."
2797,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello, everybodyyy."
2798,1,9,Stan Marsh,"What's in the box, dude?"
2799,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's a surprise.
2800,1,9,Eric Cartman,Let me see!
2801,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,O-Okay. But don't scare him...
2802,1,9,Stan Marsh,"[angrily] Dude, sick!!!"
2803,1,9,Eric Cartman,Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
2804,1,9,Kenny McCormick,(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
2805,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Wait! You guys! He's alive!
2806,1,9,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep."
2807,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!!"
2808,1,9,Researcher,Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready?
2809,1,9,Researcher,Here we go: Christ
2810,1,9,Researcher,Hm. Okay. Cherub.
2811,1,9,Researcher,Hm... Camel
2812,1,9,Researcher,Hm. Sad.
2813,1,9,Researcher,Stupid Wop Dago.
2814,1,9,Researcher,Bench...
2815,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?"
2816,1,9,Janitor 2,Mayor's orders.
2817,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus."
2818,1,9,Eric Cartman,Thanks to Kyle's mother.
2819,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, Cartman!"
2820,1,9,Mr Garrison,So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.
2821,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Yes, Eric?"
2822,1,9,Eric Cartman,"How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor."
2823,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
2824,1,9,Eric Cartman,"O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch,
she's a big fat bitch,
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch,
if there ever was a bitch,
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls."
2825,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, Cartman!"
2826,1,9,Mr Hankey,Howdy-ho!
2827,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,[hushed] Mr. Hankey.
2828,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Monday she's a bitch,
on Tuesday she's a bitch,
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different,
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!"
2829,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Golly, that isn't very nice."
2830,1,9,Mr Hankey,I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
2831,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom? 
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BIIIIII-I-I-ITCH - aahh."
2832,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Hankey, no!"
2833,1,9,Mr Hankey,Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!
2834,1,9,Mr Garrison,What the...
2835,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Gross, Kyle!"
2836,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric?"
2837,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Uuuuuuhh...
2838,1,9,Eric Cartman,YOU SICK BASTARD!
2839,1,9,Mr Mackey,"Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?"
2840,1,9,Jr,"Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?"
2841,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,I don't have a problem.
2842,1,9,Mr Mackey,"Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia."
2843,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
2844,1,9,Mr Mackey,"Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle."
2845,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mookie-stinks?
2846,1,9,Mr Mackey,"Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?"
2847,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Wull, not on purpose."
2848,1,9,Mr Mackey,"So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya?"
2849,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, sometimes..."
2850,1,9,Mr Mackey,And that must make you mad.
2851,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well sure.
2852,1,9,Mr Mackey,"Mad enough to kill, Kyle???"
2853,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude!"
2854,1,9,Mr Mackey,"Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?"
2855,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
2856,1,9,Mr Mackey,Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have.
2857,1,9,Mr Hankey,Kyle!
2858,1,9,Mr Hankey,Howdy-ho.
2859,1,9,Mr Mackey,"Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?"
2860,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way..."
2861,1,9,Mr Mackey,"To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac..."
2862,1,9,Mr Mackey,"Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey!"
2863,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy..."
2864,1,9,Students,Hhmm.
2865,1,9,Mr Garrison,"...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?"
2866,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous."
2867,1,9,Mr Garrison,Okay. Now let's practice our...
2868,1,9,Mr Mackey,No! Get away from me!
2869,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Here. Just look more closely at it.
2870,1,9,Mr Mackey,"No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?"
2871,1,9,Stan Marsh,"Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please."
2872,1,9,Nurse,Reason?
2873,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
2874,1,9,Nurse,Any allergies?
2875,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,No.
2876,1,9,Nurse,Jacket!
2877,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!"
2878,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on?"
2879,1,9,Artsy Man,"Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down."
2880,1,9,His Date,"Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great!"
2881,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it."
2882,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma..."
2883,1,9,MC,Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday...
2884,1,9,Man 1,"[pointing] Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage. That's very offensive to non-Christians."
2885,1,9,Uncle Jimbo,"Oh, come on!"
2886,1,9,Man 1,"Hey! Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!"
2887,1,9,Randy Marsh,I agree.
2888,1,9,Mr Garrison,Oh brother.
2889,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?"
2890,1,9,Mr Garrison,"And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there."
2891,1,9,Kenny McCormick,(Hunh?)
2892,1,9,MC,"Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef."
2893,1,9,Chef,"I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights."
2894,1,9,Chef,"You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
You can break my heart, and that means..."
2895,1,9,Stan Marsh,I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him.
2896,1,9,Chef,"...We should make love,"
2897,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it."
2898,1,9,Chef,...'Cause if we don't-
2899,1,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay, kids, get ready to take your places."
2900,1,9,MC,"Thank you, Chef!"
2901,1,9,Kenny McCormick,(Phew!)
2902,1,9,MC,"And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!"
2903,1,9,Voice over,"As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes."
2904,1,9,Voice over,How like a turtle the sun looks.
2905,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,What the hell is this???
2906,1,9,Sheila Broflovski,This is horrible!!!
2907,1,9,Father Maxi,This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!
2908,1,9,Mr Garrison,You're the ones who made it this way!
2909,1,9,Father Maxi,"Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian."
2910,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!
2911,1,9,Elderly Tree Hugger,All you bastards ruined Christmas!
2912,1,9,Gerald Broflovski,Get him in the ribs!
2913,1,9,Father Maxi,Oof.
2914,1,9,Man in audience,Damn tree-hugger!
2915,1,9,Stan Marsh,"This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen."
2916,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah.
2917,1,9,Chef,"Say, where's Kyle?"
2918,1,9,Stan Marsh,We committed him.
2919,1,9,Chef,What? Why?
2920,1,9,Eric Cartman,'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
2921,1,9,Chef,Chirstmas poo? You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
2922,1,9,Stan Marsh,Huh?! O-oh.
2923,1,9,Stan Marsh,"This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!"
2924,1,9,Chef,Well! You can believe in him now.
2925,1,9,Woman,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH.
2926,1,9,Stan Marsh,I believe.
2927,1,9,Wendy Testaburger,I believe in Mr. Hankey.
2928,1,9,Mr Hankey,Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!
2929,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery."
2930,1,9,Eric Cartman,Whoa!!
2931,1,9,Stan Marsh,Whoa!!
2932,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Howdy-ho, Chef!"
2933,1,9,Chef,"Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!"
2934,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!"
2935,1,9,Eric Cartman,Talking poo is where I draw the line!
2936,1,9,Mr Hankey,What's all the ruckus?
2937,1,9,Chef,"I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey. The whole town is about to kill each other."
2938,1,9,Mr Hankey,I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!
2939,1,9,Mr Hankey,STOP FIGHTING!!
2940,1,9,The Mayor,"Oh my God, what the hell is that thing?"
2941,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, ""Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies""."
2942,1,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
2943,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew..."
2944,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!"
2945,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no, I'm not sane yet!"
2946,1,9,Mr Hankey,I brought some friends with me.
2947,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,Friends?
2948,1,9,Townsfolk,"Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!"
2949,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy?
2950,1,9,Townsfolk,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo..."
2951,1,9,Townsfolk,"...he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you..."
2952,1,9,Townsfolk,...Even if you're a Jew
2953,1,9,Mr Pirrip,"Sometimes he's nutty, sometimes he's corny,
he can be brown or greenish-brown
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
he might come to your town"
2954,1,9,Townsfolk,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me. I love you
Heeeeeeee Looooooves Yoooooouu!"
2955,1,9,Mr Hankey,"Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas."
2956,1,9,Eric Cartman,Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!
2957,1,9,Santa Claus,Howdy-ho ho ho!
2958,1,9,Stan Marsh,"You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too."
2959,1,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah...[concerned] You know, it seems like something's still not right."
2960,1,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, something feels...unfinished."
2961,1,9,Stan Marsh,Wh-what could it be?
2962,1,9,Kenny McCormick,(Yee he hee!)
2963,1,9,Jesus Christ,"Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me..."
2964,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan..."
2965,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What is this, Cartman?"
2966,1,10,Eric Cartman,They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
2967,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?"
2968,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday..."
2969,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever."
2970,1,10,Eric Cartman,That's right.
2971,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too."
2972,1,10,Eric Cartman,That's ri-aayy.
2973,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation."
2974,1,10,Eric Cartman,"[darting over] Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!"
2975,1,10,Eric Cartman,I shoved it up my ass!
2976,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!"
2977,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde..."
2978,1,10,Mr Garrison,"[excitedly] Children, children! Today is a very special day."
2979,1,10,Eric Cartman,"No, my birthday isn't until Saturday."
2980,1,10,Mr Garrison,"I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today."
2981,1,10,Eric Cartman,Eeeeeeh!
2982,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... [leans down to the new kid, Damien] uh-uh, what's your name again?"
2983,1,10,Damien Thorn,Damien!
2984,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus...dominus...
2985,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Say 'hi' to Damien! [Silence.] And where are you from, Damien?"
2986,1,10,Damien Thorn,The seventh layer of hell!
2987,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama."
2988,1,10,Damien Thorn,"My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father!"
2989,1,10,Ominous Voice,... rectus... cheesy poofs...
2990,1,10,Mr Garrison,Your father?
2991,1,10,Damien Thorn,The Prince of Darkness!
2992,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era."
2993,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass..."
2994,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?"
2995,1,10,Damien Thorn,Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
2996,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?"
2997,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus... dominus...
2998,1,10,Eric Cartman,Byah. Oof!
2999,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude!"
3000,1,10,Ominous Voice,Sancti...
3001,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn, what a freak!"
3002,1,10,Eric Cartman,[Getting up off the floor.] Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!
3003,1,10,Ominous Voice,Cheesy poofs...
3004,1,10,Damien Thorn,Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
3005,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?"
3006,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Eheh. [Taunting.] You got in trouble, you got in trouble."
3007,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?"
3008,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
3009,1,10,Eric Cartman,Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
3010,1,10,Stan Marsh,Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
3011,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that's weak!"
3012,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?"
3013,1,10,Stan Marsh,Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
3014,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then."
3015,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is."
3016,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is."
3017,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?"
3018,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!"
3019,1,10,Damien Thorn,Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
3020,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!"
3021,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two."
3022,1,10,Eric Cartman,Eeyy!
3023,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me."
3024,1,10,Damien Thorn,Then I will call you Pip.
3025,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Right-o.
3026,1,10,Stan Marsh,Hey new kid!
3027,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog."
3028,1,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)"
3029,1,10,Damien Thorn,That does it! Woo-paah.
3030,1,10,Ominous Voice,... rectus... dominus...
3031,1,10,Stan Marsh,What the... ?
3032,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
3033,1,10,Stan Marsh,A what?
3034,1,10,Kenny McCormick,Quack-quack.
3035,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!"
3036,1,10,Chef,"Hello there, children."
3037,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Chef."
3038,1,10,Chef,How's it going?
3039,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Bad.
3040,1,10,Chef,Why bad?
3041,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak."
3042,1,10,Chef,"Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song, 
We're all special in our own way
everybody's different, but that's okay,
'cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin,
different points of view, be tall or thin,
it doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin,"
3043,1,10,Chef,"With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,"
3044,1,10,Chef,"Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh..."
3045,1,10,Chef,What were we talking about again?
3046,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,The new kid.
3047,1,10,Damien Thorn,Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all!
3048,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs...
3049,1,10,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
3050,1,10,Chef,Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!
3051,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"We told you, dude."
3052,1,10,Chef,"We've got to do something, children!"
3053,1,10,Damien Thorn,Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus!
3054,1,10,Ominous Voice,... rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... rectus... dominus...
3055,1,10,Stan Marsh,Jesus?
3056,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus?
3057,1,10,Roland,"Two minutes to air, Jesus."
3058,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. [Stan and Kyle dash in.]"
3059,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, Jesus!"
3060,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show."
3061,1,10,Stan Marsh,"No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil."
3062,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny."
3063,1,10,Kenny McCormick,Quack-quack.
3064,1,10,Jesus Christ,Wow. That's pretty heavy.
3065,1,10,Stan Marsh,"This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you."
3066,1,10,Jesus Christ,The Dark Prince?
3067,1,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
3068,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
3069,1,10,Jesus Christ,"So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One."
3070,1,10,Stan Marsh,[To Kyle.] Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
3071,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth."
3072,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,... K.
3073,1,10,Groundskeeper,"Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!"
3074,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money..."
3075,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus... dominus... sancti...
3076,1,10,Red,Aaaaa Bebe!
3077,1,10,Bebe Stevens,Our slide!
3078,1,10,Damien Thorn,Feel my wrath!
3079,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"[As Damien torches the hobby elephants.] Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday."
3080,1,10,Damien Thorn,I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan!
3081,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.
3082,1,10,Ominous Voice,... Rectus... cheesy poofs...
3083,1,10,Jesus Christ,Damien!
3084,1,10,Damien Thorn,Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
3085,1,10,Jesus Christ,"So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!"
3086,1,10,Damien Thorn,"Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes."
3087,1,10,Jesus Christ,Let him come then. I shall stop him!
3088,1,10,Damien Thorn,Behold! He is already upon us! [Clouds begin to conceal the sun.
3089,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ohh, dude!"
3090,1,10,Satan,Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
3091,1,10,Jimbo Kern,What the hell's going on here?
3092,1,10,Father Maxi,Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
3093,1,10,Blonde,What's happening?
3094,1,10,Chef,"Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!"
3095,1,10,Chef,"Not you, dammit!"
3096,1,10,Satan,Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
3097,1,10,Damien Thorn,"Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!"
3098,1,10,Jesus Christ,Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
3099,1,10,Jimbo Kern,"Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!"
3100,1,10,Stan Marsh,You're gonna fight Satan?
3101,1,10,Jesus Christ,"This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history."
3102,1,10,Commercial,Who will win our souls?
3103,1,10,Commercial,Our Savior and Lord?
3104,1,10,Commercial,Or the Prince of Darkness?
3105,1,10,Commercial,It's the final battle between Good and Evil.
3106,1,10,Commercial,"And it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95."
3107,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!"
3108,1,10,Kenny McCormick,Quack-quack.
3109,1,10,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?"
3110,1,10,Eric Cartman,Cartman's birthday!
3111,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
3112,1,10,Eric Cartman,"You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel."
3113,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in."
3114,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!"
3115,1,10,Father Maxi,When is Satan gonna show up?
3116,1,10,Stan Marsh,Did the Devil show up yet?
3117,1,10,Jesus Christ,Not yet.
3118,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?"
3119,1,10,Jesus Christ,... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
3120,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish."
3121,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oh.
3122,1,10,Jimbo Kern,"We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince."
3123,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation."
3124,1,10,Father Maxi,"You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus."
3125,1,10,Ominous Vocie,Rectus... dominus...
3126,1,10,Jesus Christ,Behold. The Evil One approaches.
3127,1,10,Satan,Yeah.
3128,1,10,Mr Garrison,Holy poop on a stick!
3129,1,10,Satan,Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!
3130,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge."
3131,1,10,Jimbo Kern,Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
3132,1,10,Satan,"Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!"
3133,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oh - oh yeah??
3134,1,10,Man in crowd,Damn.
3135,1,10,Satan,I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.
3136,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oh yeah??
3137,1,10,Announcer,"Satan weighs in at - 320 lbs, 4 oz."
3138,1,10,Announcer,"Jesus Christ weighs in at - 135 lbs., 1 oz."
3139,1,10,Chef,Ooh crap.
3140,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Aw, come on! I weigh more than that."
3141,1,10,Satan,"Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world."
3142,1,10,Jimbo Kern,[Holding his ticket up.] Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
3143,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too."
3144,1,10,Father Maxi,Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck.
3145,1,10,Man 1,Change my bet!
3146,1,10,Man 2,I'm betting on the Devil!
3147,1,10,Jimbo Kern,I wanna change my bet to Satan.
3148,1,10,Ned Gerblansky,"Me, too."
3149,1,10,Mr Garrison,Wai-wa I was here first.
3150,1,10,Mr Mackey,"Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay?"
3151,1,10,Damien Thorn,Everybody hates me!
3152,1,10,Mr Mackey,Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
3153,1,10,Damien Thorn,Because I'm the son of the Devil?
3154,1,10,Mr Mackey,"Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?"
3155,1,10,Damien Thorn,Because I... burn them and kill them?
3156,1,10,Mr Mackey,"Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. And no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. You be passive, m'kay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now."
3157,1,10,Clyde Donovan,I bet I can spit the most on him.
3158,1,10,Bebe Stevens,Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.
3159,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
3160,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'."
3161,1,10,Eric Cartman,"[Sees Damien coming.] Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!"
3162,1,10,Damien Thorn,I apologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice.
3163,1,10,Eric Cartman,"[Farts and moves away.] Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!"
3164,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart."
3165,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on.
3166,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Bubye, Fart-boy."
3167,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,See ya.
3168,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Good day, Damien. How are you?"
3169,1,10,Damien Thorn,"Those guys farted on me, and then called me-"
3170,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
3171,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-"
3172,1,10,Chef,Oh ooh.
3173,1,10,Jesus Christ,I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.
3174,1,10,Jesus Christ,"In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!"
3175,1,10,Father Maxi,"You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!"
3176,1,10,Jesus Christ,Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
3177,1,10,Father Maxi,"Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus."
3178,1,10,Jesus Christ,I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
3179,1,10,Father Maxi,"Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!"
3180,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too."
3181,1,10,Jimbo Kern,Yeah.
3182,1,10,Father Maxi,Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.
3183,1,10,Father Maxi,"What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?"
3184,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, crazy."
3185,1,10,Mr Allen,He's so gay.
3186,1,10,Mr McDonald,Yeah.
3187,1,10,Jesus Christ,You're all a bunch of Judases!
3188,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Jesus."
3189,1,10,Jesus Christ,"What are you doing out so late, kids?"
3190,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
3191,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right?"
3192,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God."
3193,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?"
3194,1,10,Jesus Christ,"No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?"
3195,1,10,Reporter 1,"Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?"
3196,1,10,Satan,I will crush him like a little bug!
3197,1,10,Reporter 2,"Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War?"
3198,1,10,Don King,"Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring."
3199,1,10,Eric Cartman,"You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?"
3200,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs."
3201,1,10,Jesus Christ,"No way, dude!"
3202,1,10,Chef,[In the ring.] Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
3203,1,10,Stan Marsh,"But you're his sparring partner, Chef."
3204,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you have to hit him."
3205,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train."
3206,1,10,Chef,Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
3207,1,10,Jesus Christ,Give it your best sho- [Poof.] Oh! [Falls back to the floor.]
3208,1,10,Chef,Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
3209,1,10,Jesus Christ,Anybody get the number of that truck? [Drops his head.]
3210,1,10,Liane Cartman,"Come on, kiddies. Eat more."
3211,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef."
3212,1,10,Chef,"Yup! Here's your present, children."
3213,1,10,Chef,"Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later."
3214,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, you just got here, Chef!"
3215,1,10,Chef,"I know, but the fight is starting."
3216,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili."
3217,1,10,Liane Cartman,Mmmmm.
3218,1,10,Chef,Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
3219,1,10,Damien Thorn,I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
3220,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there."
3221,1,10,Damien Thorn,The other kids have always hated you?
3222,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me."
3223,1,10,Michael Buffer,"In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!"
3224,1,10,Michael Buffer,"And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!"
3225,1,10,Michael Buffer,"Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!"
3226,1,10,Referee Mills Lane,"Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles."
3227,1,10,Eric Cartman,Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
3228,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid."
3229,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"And neither were you, Pip!"
3230,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-"
3231,1,10,Damien Thorn,Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.
3232,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus... dominus...
3233,1,10,Ominous Voice,... Sancti... cheesy poofs...
3234,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Aaaa!
3235,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!
3236,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wow!
3237,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, that was cool!"
3238,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien."
3239,1,10,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased]
3240,1,10,Satan,"Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!"
3241,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves.] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[She leaves.] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? [Thumps the table in anger.]"
3242,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It's a game, dude. It's really fun."
3243,1,10,Eric Cartman,YOU SON OF A BITCH! [Lunges towards Kyle.]
3244,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,[As he is pinned by Cartman.] Aaaaa!
3245,1,10,Eric Cartman,"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! [Slapping him around by now.]"
3246,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,They were all out of 'em dude!
3247,1,10,Eric Cartman,I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
3248,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,[At the same time.] Aaaaaaaa!
3249,1,10,Eric Cartman,That's it! Party is over!
3250,1,10,Eric Cartman,Everybody go home!
3251,1,10,Eric Cartman,"GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT!"
3252,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!"
3253,1,10,Eric Cartman,Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
3254,1,10,Damien Thorn,Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.
3255,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Aaanh, he does this all the time."
3256,1,10,Chef,"Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!"
3257,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty."
3258,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oh!
3259,1,10,Satan,"Fight, dammit!"
3260,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oow! [Satan pick him up] Ooooooh!
3261,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [The round ends.] You've got to fight, Jesus."
3262,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook."
3263,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you."
3264,1,10,Jesus Christ,It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
3265,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him.] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!"
3266,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Uuuuh. Stan?
3267,1,10,Stan Marsh,Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
3268,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Stan.
3269,1,10,Stan Marsh,She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
3270,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Stan!
3271,1,10,Stan Marsh,[Turning to Kyle.] What?
3272,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second."
3273,1,10,Stan Marsh,[Thinks a moment.] ... Really?
3274,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude!"
3275,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks."
3276,1,10,Stan Marsh,"You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'."
3277,1,10,Jesus Christ,... Who said that?
3278,1,10,Stan Marsh,"You did, Jesus."
3279,1,10,Jesus Christ,"You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys!"
3280,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
3281,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Nah, I saw it on Star Trek."
3282,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hmmm.
3283,1,10,Satan,"Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!"
3284,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Okay, pal. You asked for it!"
3285,1,10,Satan,"Ooooooh, you got me."
3286,1,10,Referee Mills Lane,One... Two... Three...
3287,1,10,Jimbo Kern,No way! He barely touched him!
3288,1,10,Referee Mills Lane,... Seven... Eight.
3289,1,10,Referee Mills Lane,... Nine... Ten. You're out!
3290,1,10,Stan Marsh,Our Savior!
3291,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Our Savior!
3292,1,10,Michael Buffer,"The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!"
3293,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!"
3294,1,10,Jimbo Kern,Yeah!
3295,1,10,Satan,Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?
3296,1,10,Satan,"Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!"
3297,1,10,Father Maxi,I don't believe this!
3298,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, what a mean thing to do!"
3299,1,10,Satan,"[Now on the Forum floor.] Farewell, fools!"
3300,1,10,Jimbo Kern,"Man, that guy is a jerk."
3301,1,10,Stan Marsh,[Over the microphone.] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
3302,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Boy, did we get screwed."
3303,1,10,Chef,"Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?"
3304,1,10,Jesus Christ,Aw heck. [Puts his halo back on.] Do I have a choice?
3305,1,10,Jimbo Kern,"Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!"
3306,1,10,Jimbo Kern,Ih-it's comin' right for us!
3307,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
3308,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
3309,1,10,Damien Thorn,"Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you."
3310,1,10,Stan Marsh,You're leaving already?
3311,1,10,Damien Thorn,I have to. My dad's always on the move.
3312,1,10,Stan Marsh,Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
3313,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
3314,1,10,Stan Marsh,Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
3315,1,10,Liane Cartman,"More pie, hon?"
3316,1,10,Eric Cartman,Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
3317,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day."
3318,1,11,Stan Marsh,I know.
3319,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
3320,1,11,Stan Marsh,"I can't afford a cruise, dude."
3321,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise."
3322,1,11,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman!"
3323,1,11,Eric Cartman,[still laughing] That is so-ho lame!
3324,1,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh man, I..."
3325,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
3326,1,11,Eric Cartman,"Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time."
3327,1,11,Principal Victoria,"[Rushing in.] Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery."
3328,1,11,Principal Victoria,So you're going to have a substitute teacher.
3329,1,11,Principal Victoria,And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.
3330,1,11,Principal Victoria,"Yes, little boy?"
3331,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
3332,1,11,Principal Victoria,"...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen."
3333,1,11,Ms Ellen,"[Brightly.] Hello, children."
3334,1,11,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
3335,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa!
3336,1,11,Eric Cartman,"[Slowly.] Wow, she's pretty."
3337,1,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
3338,1,11,Stan Marsh,You can say that again.
3339,1,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
3340,1,11,Principal Victoria,"Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay."
3341,1,11,Ms Ellen,Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.
3342,1,11,Ms Ellen,"Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,"
3343,1,11,Ms Ellen,...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us.
3344,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,[Gasps.] Stan? Stan?!
3345,1,11,Ms Ellen,"Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?"
3346,1,11,Eric Cartman,"[Brightly.] Yes, ma'am."
3347,1,11,Ms Ellen,Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
3348,1,11,Stan Marsh,Yeu-bluuuch.
3349,1,11,Ms Ellen,"[A moment later.] Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?"
3350,1,11,Eric Cartman,"Noh, he always pukes when he's in love."
3351,1,11,Stan Marsh,"I'll kick your ass, Cartman!"
3352,1,11,Ms Ellen,So you're alright?
3353,1,11,Stan Marsh,Bluuuch.
3354,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!"
3355,1,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes."
3356,1,11,Tom,"You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want."
3357,1,11,Mr Garrison,Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?
3358,1,11,Mr Hat,"It sure is, Mr. Garrison!"
3359,1,11,Tom,"Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this."
3360,1,11,Mr Garrison,Hmmm.
3361,1,11,Tom,"Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this."
3362,1,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that's not bad."
3363,1,11,Tom,"Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this."
3364,1,11,Mr Garrison,WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
3365,1,11,Tom,Alright-y then.
3366,1,11,Tom,"Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food."
3367,1,11,Mr Garrison,I can live with that.
3368,1,11,Tom,"[Excitedly.] Alrighty then, let's get started!"
3369,1,11,Eric Cartman,"She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!"
3370,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she help but look at you!"
3371,1,11,Stan Marsh,You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
3372,1,11,Eric Cartman,Until you puked on her.
3373,1,11,Chef,"[Approaching.] Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?"
3374,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!"
3375,1,11,Chef,Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
3376,1,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that one!"
3377,1,11,Chef,Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
3378,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"[Approaching.] Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?"
3379,1,11,Stan Marsh,No.
3380,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,Well it is!
3381,1,11,Chef,That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
3382,1,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)"
3383,1,11,Chef,Thaat's right!
3384,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?"
3385,1,11,Chef,That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...
3386,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"[Panicking a little.] Stan? We're still Valentines, right?"
3387,1,11,Stan Marsh,"Sure, Wendy, whatever."
3388,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents
3389,1,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
3390,1,11,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners"
3391,1,11,Female singer,"I remember when we were still in love
The moments that we shared were timeless.
Saw it in the wind, knew it in a glance,
the songs we sang were simple reminders."
3392,1,12,Anthropologist,"...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month."
3393,1,12,Eric Cartman,Boooriing.
3394,1,12,Mr Garrison,"Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep."
3395,1,12,Anthropologist,"Now, can anybody tell me, who left these arrowheads here?"
3396,1,12,Stan Marsh,Isn't that your job?
3397,1,12,Anthropologist,"Well... yes, but I want to see if you're learning anything."
3398,1,12,Stan Marsh,Oooh.
3399,1,12,Anthropologist,"Okay, I tell you what. Why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads."
3400,1,12,Eric Cartman,"Day is never finished,
Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free..."
3401,1,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude. Shut up, Cartman."
3402,1,12,Pip,Oh! Oh I think I found one!
3403,1,12,Eric Cartman,"No, I found it."
3404,1,12,Pip,Oh. I do believe I found it first.
3405,1,12,Eric Cartman,"No, I did, Pip."
3406,1,12,Pip,Oh dear.
3407,1,12,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it."
3408,1,12,Pip,What do you mean?
3409,1,12,Eric Cartman,"Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead."
3410,1,12,Pip,"Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must."
3411,1,12,Eric Cartman,"Okay, ready? I'll go first."
3412,1,12,Pip,"Well-uh I, I guess you win."
3413,1,12,Eric Cartman,"Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it."
3414,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school."
3415,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
3416,1,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.)"
3417,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
3418,1,13,Stan Marsh,Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
3419,1,13,Ms Crabtree,"Come on, we're running late!"
3420,1,13,Stan Marsh,"We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!"
3421,1,13,Ms Crabtree,What did you say?!
3422,1,13,Stan Marsh,"I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch."
3423,1,13,Ms Crabtree,"Oh. Alright, then."
3424,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude."
3425,1,13,Stan Marsh,I always wondered if that would work.
3426,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Hello, boys."
3427,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass Mitt to mouth.] I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school."
3428,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard."
3429,1,13,Stan Marsh,In the backyard?
3430,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?"
3431,1,13,Polly,"Yes, Eric, I would like some tea. Thank you."
3432,1,13,Eric Cartman,"You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants."
3433,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?"
3434,1,13,Clyde,"Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?"
3435,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am."
3436,1,13,Polly,"You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody likes you."
3437,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. [Sips.]"
3438,1,13,Stan Marsh,"[Behind the bushes with the others.] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
3439,1,13,Kenny McCormick,"(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.)"
3440,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
3441,1,13,Stan Marsh,"No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help."
3442,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
3443,1,13,Peter,"[Back at table.] We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea."
3444,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey."
3445,1,13,Polly,Eric is the best!
3446,1,13,Clyde,Hooray for Eric!
3447,1,13,Peter,Eric kicks ass!
3448,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman."
3449,1,13,Mr Mackey,"Oh, well, there's a news flash!"
3450,1,13,Stan Marsh,Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
3451,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
3452,1,13,Mr Mackey,"Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay?"
3453,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Woo-whataya mean?
3454,1,13,Mr Mackey,Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
3455,1,13,Stan Marsh,No.
3456,1,13,Mr Mackey,"Well-obviously something is bothering him. [looks left] Oh, of course!"
3457,1,13,Mr Mackey,"My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay?"
3458,1,13,Stan Marsh,Is that legal?
3459,1,13,Mr Mackey,"Oh, hell yes!"
3460,1,13,Eric Cartman,"My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants."
3461,1,13,Polly,"Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true."
3462,1,13,Peter,"Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much."
3463,1,13,Eric Cartman,"That's niiice, Peter Panda."
3464,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made."
3465,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
3466,1,13,Stan Marsh,"I donnow, just keep rolling."
3467,1,13,Eric Cartman,"More tea, Rumpertumskin?"
3468,1,13,Rumpertumskin,"Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome."
3469,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?"
3470,1,13,Clyde,I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
3471,1,13,Eric Cartman,Eeeyy!
3472,1,13,Kitty,Meow.
3473,1,13,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!"
3474,1,13,Kitty,Meow.
3475,1,13,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!"
3476,1,13,Kitty,Hhhhhcck!
3477,1,13,Liane Cartman,"How is your beefy roast, snookums?"
3478,1,13,Eric Cartman,Mom? Can I ask you a question?
3479,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Sure, hon."
3480,1,13,Eric Cartman,"You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?"
3481,1,13,Liane Cartman,Uh huuuh.
3482,1,13,Eric Cartman,"And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?"
3483,1,13,Liane Cartman,Yyeess??
3484,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Well, what's your question, hon?"
3485,1,13,Eric Cartman,God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
3486,1,13,Liane Cartman,Oooooohh.
3487,1,13,Eric Cartman,I want to know where I came from.
3488,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Ooohh, hhmmm [Finger to lips.]. Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other."
3489,1,13,Eric Cartman,Uh huuh.
3490,1,13,Liane Cartman,And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.
3491,1,13,Eric Cartman,So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
3492,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance."
3493,1,13,Liane Cartman,I was young and naive then...
3494,1,13,Man,"Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman."
3495,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he. [The band ends its tune.] I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! [She stands next to Barbrady.]"
3496,1,13,Trainee Barbrady,"I wouldn't mind gettin' ahold of your cookies, Ms. Cartman!"
3497,1,13,Liane Cartman,"[Breathlessly.] Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady."
3498,1,13,Trainee Barbrady,"[Takes a cookie and bites into it.] Mm, that's a good cookie! [The band resumes playing.]"
3499,1,13,Jimbo Kern,"Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!"
3500,1,13,Liane Cartman,"And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water."
3501,1,13,Singing,"There you are, like a throbbing star. I want you to make love to me."
3502,1,13,Liane Cartman,"I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin."
3503,1,13,Eric Cartman,"So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?"
3504,1,13,Liane Cartman,Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
3505,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[Weighs the story.] That isn't a very romantic story, Mom."
3506,1,13,Liane Cartman,I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
3507,1,13,Eric Cartman,Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
3508,1,13,Kitty,Meow.
3509,1,13,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!"
3510,1,13,Annoncer,"Coming this Sunday, [Music begins to play.] a major television event that will blow you away. Terrance. Phillip."
3511,1,13,Announcer,"In the harrowing made-for-TV drama, Not Without My Anus, based on a true story."
3512,1,13,Terrance,"Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter."
3513,1,13,Phillip,"Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance."
3514,1,13,Annoncer,See Canada's hottest stars on the HBC movie of the week.
3515,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!"
3516,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. It looks riveting."
3517,1,13,Stan Marsh,Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
3518,1,13,Grandpa Marsh,"No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show."
3519,1,13,Stan Marsh,Aaawww.
3520,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,[At the same time.] Hunh?
3521,1,13,Annoncer,"And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos. Here is you host, Bob Saget!"
3522,1,13,Bob Saget,"Hey, I just flew into the studio."
3523,1,13,Bob Saget,Boy are my arms tired. Heheh. Heh.
3524,1,13,Bob Saget,"Wha, Why didn't the skeleton cross the road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts."
3525,1,13,Bob Saget,Knock knock.
3526,1,13,Bob Saget,Bob.
3527,1,13,Bob Saget,Bob Saget..
3528,1,13,Stan Marsh,This guy sucks!
3529,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
3530,1,13,Stan Marsh,Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
3531,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[Indian music plays.] Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people."
3532,1,13,Stan Marsh,What??
3533,1,13,Eric Cartman,Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
3534,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation."
3535,1,13,Stan Marsh,"What are you talking about, Cartman?!"
3536,1,13,Eric Cartman,"My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?"
3537,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Go ahead, dude."
3538,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
3539,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!"
3540,1,13,Bob Saget,"Just a free li'l reminder to all of you out there: send us your stupidest home videos. Grand prize for this month will be $10,000. [Chuckles.]"
3541,1,13,Grandpa Marsh,Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
3542,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video."
3543,1,13,Chief Running Water,...And Bear cried to Eagle-
3544,1,13,Indian 1,"Running Water, there is some kid here to see you."
3545,1,13,Chief Running Water,What kid?
3546,1,13,Indian 1,He claims to be your kid.
3547,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Hiya, Dad!"
3548,1,13,Chief Running Water,Who the hell are you?
3549,1,13,Eric Cartman,"I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance."
3550,1,13,Chief Running Water,Your mother?
3551,1,13,Eric Cartman,Liane Cartman.
3552,1,13,Chief Running Water,"Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second. [Suddenly serious.] Look, kid, I'm not your father."
3553,1,13,Eric Cartman,But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
3554,1,13,Chief Running Water,"Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'"
3555,1,13,Eric Cartman,Whatooya mean?
3556,1,13,Chief Running Water,"She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'"
3557,1,13,Eric Cartman,Huh??
3558,1,13,Chief Running Water,Your mom's a slut.
3559,1,13,Eric Cartman,Eeyy!!
3560,1,13,Chief Running Water,Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.
3561,1,13,Chief Running Water,"We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot."
3562,1,13,Chief Running Water,There you are...
3563,1,13,Chief Running Water,"I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things."
3564,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder."
3565,1,13,Chief Running Water,"Whoa, Helloooh!!"
3566,1,13,Liane Cartman,[Interrupting the action.] Wait. Wait.
3567,1,13,Liane Cartman,] Who is that?
3568,1,13,Singing,There you are like a throbbing star-
3569,1,13,Liane Cartman,Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
3570,1,13,Chief Running Water,Huh??
3571,1,13,Chief Running Water,You gotta be kidding me.
3572,1,13,Liane Cartman,[Approaching Chef.] Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. [Flirts with him gently.]
3573,1,13,Chef,Nawh. I'm new in town.
3574,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Well, what's a nice, handsome, black [She looks at his crotch. He follows her gaze.] man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?"
3575,1,13,Chef,I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
3576,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?"
3577,1,13,Chef,"Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?"
3578,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Ahah, I'm plastered! [Tongues come out and they start kissing.]"
3579,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Alone with the Chief] His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
3580,1,13,Chief Running Water,He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
3581,1,13,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
3582,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it."
3583,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
3584,1,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
3585,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs."
3586,1,13,Stan Marsh,[With the right hand cupped to the side of his mouth.] Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
3587,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[With rap beats playing now.] 'S up, homies?"
3588,1,13,Stan Marsh,Cartman?!
3589,1,13,Eric Cartman,I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
3590,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You live on the Eastside, Cartman!"
3591,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I thought you said you were Native American."
3592,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Aloofly.] Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.
3593,1,13,Eric Cartman,You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
3594,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000."
3595,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)
3596,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Hold on, Kenny!"
3597,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hold on, Kenny!"
3598,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-
3599,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(AARGH.)
3600,1,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Goddamn, why-)"
3601,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Oh this freakin'-)
3602,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(AARGH.)
3603,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Phew.)
3604,1,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, I'm fine, guys!)"
3605,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Now if I can-)
3606,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny."
3607,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
3608,1,13,Chef,Hello?
3609,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Yo, Pops!"
3610,1,13,Chef,"[Studying...] Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?"
3611,1,13,Eric Cartman,"You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?"
3612,1,13,Chef,Get in here! [Drags him in.]
3613,1,13,Eric Cartman,Westsa-eed-eh.
3614,1,13,Chef,Take that wig off! [Does it himself.] What's gotten into you?!
3615,1,13,Eric Cartman,"You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance."
3616,1,13,Chef,"What?! Noh! Uh, did I?"
3617,1,13,Eric Cartman,He said you kissed her with your tongue.
3618,1,13,Chef,"Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children."
3619,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Dejected.] Huho. So you're not my dad?
3620,1,13,Chef,"Of course not. Here. You children sit down,"
3621,1,13,Chef,"...and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.

When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen,
and the two take off their clothes,
that's right,
And they caress and touch each other,
until the part of the man grows,
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot,
And the man says ""I love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom""
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait...
[Pause.]
...and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says,
""Baby, I'm gettin' hot!""
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of..."
3622,1,13,Eric Cartman,What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
3623,1,13,Chef,"Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember."
3624,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Whoa, Chef! [He pulls away a bit.] You're so strong!"
3625,1,13,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!"
3626,1,13,Bronco 1,Are we late for the party?
3627,1,13,Bronco 2,What the hell town is this?
3628,1,13,Singing,"There you are, like a throbbing star. I want-"
3629,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!"
3630,1,13,Chef,"Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!"
3631,1,13,Liane Cartman,Woooh! Whooppee!! [She throws her arms out in ecstasy.] Unhh!
3632,1,13,Chef,Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
3633,1,13,Mr Garrison,"You're drunk, Mr. Hat!"
3634,1,13,Singing,There you are-
3635,1,13,Chef,"Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!"
3636,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a menage o'three?"
3637,1,13,Chef,Yeah! When two women are involved. [Moves away.]
3638,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman."
3639,1,13,Chef,And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
3640,1,13,Eric Cartman,"No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!"
3641,1,13,Announcer,"And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-"
3642,1,13,Bob Saget,Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
3643,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend."
3644,1,13,Polly,"I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all."
3645,1,13,Eric Cartman,Really? You don't think so?
3646,1,13,Clyde,"Naw, you're not fat."
3647,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[Grabs a teacup.] Gee, that's kewl."
3648,1,13,Sharon Marsh,"Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning."
3649,1,13,Stan Marsh,Huh? [Looks up at them.] Oh yeah.
3650,1,13,Randy Marsh,"Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?"
3651,1,13,Stan Marsh,How 'bout some ice cream?
3652,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, with butterscotch."
3653,1,13,Sharon Marsh,"You bet, you poor dears."
3654,1,13,Bob Saget,"Now, the moment you've all been waiting for, when one of our lucky videos qualifies for the $10,000 Grand Prize to be chosen tomorrow night! The winner is [Drumroll crescendo.] Little Boy's Tea Party."

3657,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"We're gonna win $10,000! [Grandpa doesn't look pleased...]"
3658,1,13,Stan Marsh,Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! [Kyle dances gleefully.]
3659,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat."
3660,1,13,Mr Hat,"Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison."
3661,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem! [To the barkeep.] Another Cosmo, please."
3662,1,13,Eric Cartman,"All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!"
3663,1,13,Mr Garrison,"What the hell are you talking about, Eric?"
3664,1,13,Eric Cartman,It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
3665,1,13,Mr Garrison,[Gasps.] Oh.
3666,1,13,Jimbo Kern,Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.
3667,1,13,Mr Garrison,I am not gay!
3668,1,13,Eric Cartman,Then you did sleep with my mom?
3669,1,13,Mr Garrison,No!
3670,1,13,Jimbo Kern,He's gay!!
3671,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!"
3672,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?"
3673,1,13,Principal Victoria,Oooooh.
3674,1,13,Mayor McDaniels,[At the same time] Hmmm.
3675,1,13,Grizzled Man,I haven't.
3676,1,13,Mr Garrison,"...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!"
3677,1,13,Halfy,Oh. Yeah.
3678,1,13,Mr Garrison,"So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know."
3679,1,13,Jimbo Kern,"[Approaching him.] Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean."
3680,1,13,Mephesto,"Wait, wait. [Cartman stops.] I know a way to find out."
3681,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Turns around.] How?
3682,1,13,Mephesto,"At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is."
3683,1,13,Eric Cartman,Really? You can? [The dirge turns hopeful.]
3684,1,13,Mephesto,"Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but..."
3685,1,13,Eric Cartman,How much?
3686,1,13,Mephesto,Three thousand should cover it.
3687,1,13,Eric Cartman,I don't have $3000.
3688,1,13,Mephesto,Oh. Never mind.
3689,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever."
3690,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
3691,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Depressed.] Hi guys.
3692,1,13,Stan Marsh,"How's it going, Cartman?"
3693,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, fine. How are you guys?"
3694,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
3695,1,13,Eric Cartman,Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
3696,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?"
3697,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000."
3698,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude."
3699,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh..."
3700,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while."
3701,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000."
3702,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Suddenly bright.] You do?
3703,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize."

3710,1,13,Falsetto Bob Saget,"Oh, I'm a little dog. I'm just a little dog. [The dog picks up a hat and walks towards a man on a chair.] Hahaha. [Leaps up behind the man and drops the hat in place.] Hold on, I've got to put a hat on my master's head, [Jumps off, and the man turns to see the camera.] hehehahahuh."
3711,1,13,Bob Saget,"And now our second finalist, ""Little Boy Has A Tea Party."""

3715,1,13,Stan Marsh,"We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!"
3716,1,13,Eric Cartman,I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
3717,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,[Trying some encouragement] They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!
3718,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna win!.
3719,1,13,Bob Saget,"And finally our third contestant, ""Young Child Gets Hit By A Train."""
3720,1,13,Falsetto Bob Saget,"Oh, I'm such a cute little kid."
3721,1,13,Falsetto Bob Saget,"Hmmm, I wonder if I can get this go-cart started.]"
3722,1,13,Falsetto Bob Saget,Oh! I hope I don't get hit by a train.
3723,1,13,Falsetto Bob Saget,"Ooooh, I sure did."
3724,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!"
3725,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
3726,1,13,Bob Saget,"Now, that's what I call a joyride. Heeheeheeh."
3727,1,13,Bob Saget,"And the winner is, naturally, ""Little Boy Being Hit By A Train,"""

3730,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Dammit!
3731,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[Slowly, deliberately.] I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously."
3732,1,13,Bob Saget,"Stand up and take a bow, Mr. Marsh."
3733,1,13,Grandpa Marsh,I won! I won!
3734,1,13,Stan Marsh,Grandpa!!
3735,1,13,Bob Saget,"Our other finalists will have to settle for their $3000 runner-up prizes-well, see you next time."
3736,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test."
3737,1,13,Eric Cartman,Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!
3738,1,13,Mephesto,"All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef [Blinks up.], Jimbo [A bit shocked.], Mr. Garrison [Eyebrows up.], Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski [Surprised.], myself, my friend Kevin [Looks up at him.], or, the 1989 Denver Broncos."
3739,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!"
3740,1,13,Mephesto,The test results are in this envelope.
3741,1,13,Mephesto,Shall I... open it?
3742,1,13,Mr Garrison,"[Impatiently.] Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!"
3743,1,13,Mephesto,"Erhum ehrum uh [Gasps.] The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-"
3744,1,13,Announcer,[An organ plays.] Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is it - Chief Running Water? [Looks askance.] Or is it - Chef? Is it Mephesto? [Looks around.] Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison?
3745,1,13,Jimbo Kern,Nope. He's gay.
3746,1,13,Mr Garrison,You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
3747,1,13,Announcer,Is it Jimbo?
3748,1,13,Jimbo Kern,[Aghast.] Daaagh!
3749,1,13,Announcer,Or is Officer Barbrady?
3750,1,13,Officer Barbrady,Huh?! Where?!
3751,1,13,Announcer,Or could it be Ned?
3752,1,13,Ned Gerblansky,Could be.
3753,1,13,Announcer,Or Mr. Broflovski??
3754,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[Pissed.] Dad, how could you?!"
3755,1,13,Announcer,"Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new South Park, in just four weeks."
3756,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Record scratches.] What?! [Enunciating] Son of a bitch!
