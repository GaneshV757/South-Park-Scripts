0,3,1,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people [she walks to the group and smiles] for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame [she frowns], but please, give her your full attention. [to her] Go ahead."
1,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. [cheerfully] How are we all doing today?! [the kids' eyes wander] I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! [Cartman farts]"
2,3,1,Mr Garrison,"[angrily] Eric Cartman, you say ‘’excuse me”!"
3,3,1,Eric Cartman,Okay.
4,3,1,Mr Garrison,[to the choir teacher] Go ahead.
5,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Children, we are a national choir called, ""Getting Gay With Kids!"" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!"
6,3,1,Kenny McCormick,This sounds fucking screwed. [the others laugh]
7,3,1,Mr Garrison,"Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! [to the choir teacher] Go ahead."
8,3,1,Choir Teacher,"You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir [Pip yawns and Bill notices. Clyde nods off] where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest."
9,3,1,Choir Boy,"[steps forward] Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?"
10,3,1,Choir Girl,"[steps forward] That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen [Kenny sees her and begins to swoon] is made in the rainforest. [smiles back at him. Kenny's in love - ahem, distracted. The camera stays on him]"
11,3,1,Choir Teacher,"So, who wants to join the fun??"
12,3,1,Eric Cartman,What if you don't have any rhythm?
13,3,1,Choir Teacher,Excuse me?
14,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm."
15,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, fatass!"
16,3,1,Stan Marsh,Choirs suck.
17,3,1,Mr Garrison,"Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! [sighs deeply and tells the choir teacher] Go ahead."
18,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, uh, that's all, really. [the girl picks her nose, smiling at Kenny] So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front."
19,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. [the other kids laugh]"
20,3,1,Mr Garrison,"All right, that does it!!"
21,3,1,Mr Mackey,"[behind the door] I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man! [The camera is now inside] You get sent here every day, Craig!"
22,3,1,Craig Tucker,I know.
23,3,1,Mr Mackey,Why can’t you behave?
24,3,1,Craig Tucker,...I don’t know.
25,3,1,Mr Mackey,"What do you have to say for yourself?! [nothing] Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- [Craig sticks his right middle finger up] Did you just flip me off?"
26,3,1,Craig Tucker,No.
27,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- [Craig flips Mr. Mackey off again] There! You just flipped me off again!"
28,3,1,Craig Tucker,No I didn’t.
29,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! [Craig hops off the chair as the door opens. The boys enter.] Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. [Craig exits]"
30,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Craig."
31,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Ey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!"
32,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-"
33,3,1,Stan Marsh,It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
34,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh, young man, ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors."
35,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes.
36,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Well, guess what, boys? I think that ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you."
37,3,1,Stan Marsh,What?!
38,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,You can't do that! [Cartman's jaw drops]
39,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Woohoo! [the boys look at him] I mean, 'Oh.' [looks down]"
40,3,1,Mr Mackey,I think this will be very good for you [writes their names down]
41,3,1,Stan Marsh,But we don't even care about the rainforest.
42,3,1,Mr Mackey,And that's exactly why you need to go!
43,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[drops down and pleads] Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey."
44,3,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest."
45,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints."
46,3,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, I didn't realize."
47,3,1,Choir Boy,"Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?"
48,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[as he enters the bus] Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls."
49,3,1,Stan Marsh,"[As Sharon drags him to the bus] Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!"
50,3,1,Sharon Marsh,"Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. [tosses him into the bus]"
51,3,1,Stan Marsh,Nooo-ho! [The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]
52,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest."
53,3,1,Eric Cartman,Whoopee.
54,3,1,Choir Teacher,And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
55,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much."
56,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo."
57,3,1,Choir Girl,[Kenny sits next to her] My name's Kelly.
58,3,1,Kenny McCormick,My name’s Kenny.
59,3,1,Kelly,Lenny?
60,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"No, it’s Kenny."
61,3,1,Kelly,Johnny?
62,3,1,Kenny McCormick,Kenny!
63,3,1,Kelly,Oh. [looks away and picks her nose.]
64,3,1,Choir Girl,"Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography."
65,3,1,Eric Cartman,[hushed] The nightmare begins.
66,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. [the kids move to their windows and look out] Oh! This is so exciting!"
67,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!"
68,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S."
69,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! [Throws open his window and yells] Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!"
70,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, sit down!"
71,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[sits] Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? [Kenny looks at him angrily] Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor."
72,3,1,Kenny McCormick,[to Kelly] Argh! That's just so untrue.
73,3,1,Kelly,[picks her nose] Your family isn't poor? [picks her nose]
74,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, dude, look over there! [The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.] Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!"
75,3,1,Redheaded Prostitute,"[with heavy accent] What are chu looking at, man?"
76,3,1,Middle Prostitute,"Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?"
77,3,1,Eric Cartman,Okay. [pretends] Kugheek! [grins]
78,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, SIT DOWN!"
79,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-"
80,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[rushing out] Oh my God, [covers his nose] it smells like ass out here."
81,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Alll right, that does it! [turns Cartman around] Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!"
82,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[covers his nose again] I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass."
83,3,1,Kelly,"Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?"
84,3,1,Kenny McCormick,[in bliss] Uh-huh. [Kelly picks her nose again]
85,3,1,Choir Teacher,"You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-"
86,3,1,Eric Cartman,"I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!"
87,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?"
88,3,1,Eric Cartman,Why?
89,3,1,Choir Teacher,Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
90,3,1,Eric Cartman,Eh-heheh!
91,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow."
92,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,[long pause] ¿Qué?
93,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?"
94,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,[long pause] ¿Qué?
95,3,1,Choir Teacher,"We're the group singing for the ""Save The Rainforest"" summit tomorrow? [her head is cocked way to the left by now. El Presidente has no clue. Now the teacher is worried] Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. [faces the kids] Children, do any of you speak Spanish? [Cartman waves his left arm] Don't you dare! [the main door opens]"
96,3,1,Mr Mackey,[rushing in] Sorry I'm late.
97,3,1,Choir Teacher,Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
98,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Oh, no problem. [to El Presidente and his men] Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?"
99,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest.
100,3,1,Choir Teacher,Yeess!
101,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla. [Pablo appears]
102,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour."
103,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. [moves aside]"
104,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,[long pause] ¿Qué?
105,3,1,Choir Teacher,"All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin."
106,3,1,Kelly,"[walks over to Kenny, her partner] Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?"
107,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Yeah, I think so."
108,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. [chuckles and shrugs. The people just look. She presses the play button. The kids begin to dance to the music]"
109,3,1,The Tape,"[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing]There's a place that is magical, and full of rain.
[Women sing] But now it needs help, because it is in pain.
[Men sing] Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore
[All sing] We're spreading awareness like never before!
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle is out of step now]
To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay!

[Bridge. Man sings] Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
[Woman sings] There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world!
[Man joins her] World!
[Chorus. Kids rush into the audience and bring some members back as new partners]
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!
[The kids regroup and Kyle stumbles into place. The tape is stopped and the subjects just walk away]"
110,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle."
111,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks!
112,3,1,Eric Cartman,I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
113,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Fuck off, Cartman!"
114,3,1,Stan Marsh,"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right."
115,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,[alarmed] No! That's a stereotype.
116,3,1,Stan Marsh,Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. [Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle]
117,3,1,Pablo,This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
118,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!"
119,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"God-damn, it's hot out here!"
120,3,1,Stan Marsh,[sees a branch] Aaah! Snake!
121,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude. That's a branch."
122,3,1,Stan Marsh,Oh. [sees it again] Aaah! Snake!
123,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,No. That's the same branch again.
124,3,1,Stan Marsh,Oh.
125,3,1,Pablo,"[turns and stops the group] The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it."
126,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[impatient] Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. [Pablo looks at him] We hear this a million times back up in the States."
127,3,1,Pablo,"Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. [one sits in a tree, resting] Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest."
128,3,1,Kelly,"Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? [takes a picture]"
129,3,1,Eric Cartman,[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey] Bad! Bad monkey! [it screams in pain]
130,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, what the heck are you doing?? [the monkey flees]"
131,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[stops] I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head!"
132,3,1,Pablo,And here is a three-toed sloth. [hangs from a branch with all four legs]
133,3,1,Eric Cartman,[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth] It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
134,3,1,Choir Teacher,"[pulls him away] Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!"
135,3,1,Eric Cartman,[throws the branch at the sloth] Re’spect my authoritah!
136,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!"
137,3,1,Kids,YEAH!
138,3,1,Choir Boy,I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.
139,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,What's the Yanogapa?
140,3,1,Choir Teacher,"The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!"
141,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[fed up, buries his face in his mitts] Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!"
142,3,1,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAA! [hides behind a girl]
143,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Stanley, what is it?"
144,3,1,Stan Marsh,SNAAAKE! [all see and gasp]
145,3,1,Pablo,"[standing next to the snake wrapped around a tree trunk] Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature."
146,3,1,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAA! [runs farther back]
147,3,1,Pablo,"What's the matter, little boy?"
148,3,1,Eric Cartman,"He's a little wuss, what's it look like? [Stan is hiding behind some foliage]"
149,3,1,Stan Marsh,[lifts some away] I'm just a-scared of snakes.
150,3,1,Pablo,"Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. [the snake jumps out of the tree and wraps itself around him, suffocating him] Oh!! [the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls] Agh."
151,3,1,Choir Teacher,[in horror] Oh my God!! [the snake starts swallowing Pablo]
152,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!"
153,3,1,Choir Teacher,"[petrified] Jesus Christ, is he dead?! [Pablo's bones come out of the snake's anus]"
154,3,1,Stan Marsh,Dude!
155,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,My guess would be yes.
156,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, no! God, no, no! [spins around] Don't panic, children."
157,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him] Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! [hurries away, and the snake gives chase]"
158,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Maybe we came from that way. [points to her left] No, nno. Let's try this way. [points to her right and moves that way]"
159,3,1,Kelly,[walking behind Kenny] Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
160,3,1,Kenny McCormick,[stops] Yeah. Everything is fine.
161,3,1,Kelly,That's good. Can I tell you something?
162,3,1,Kenny McCormick,Okay.
163,3,1,Kelly,I think I like you. [holds his shoulder]
164,3,1,Kenny McCormick,Really?!
165,3,1,Kelly,"[releases] Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well."
166,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Oh, that's great!"
167,3,1,Kelly,"[looks away] No, that's not good."
168,3,1,Kenny McCormick,That's not good?
169,3,1,Kelly,"No. See, if I start to like you too much, [looks away] I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. [looks at him again] Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. [grabs him and gets emotional] And that would devastate me. [lets go] So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! [walks away]"
170,3,1,Kenny McCormick,[pissed] Aaaargh!
171,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!"
172,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?"
173,3,1,A Boy,I’m not.
174,3,1,Choir Teacher,Who's not?!
175,3,1,A Boy,Me.
176,3,1,Kelly,"Benny, will you hold my hand? [picks her nose. When she lowers her hand, Kenny grabs it, but she looks away] I don't want to get emotionally attached, though."
177,3,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!"
178,3,1,Choir Teacher,"No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley."
179,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"[on stage] Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.) [the worker moves along]"
180,3,1,Mr Mackey,"[approaching] Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)"
181,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
182,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)"
183,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!)
184,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)"
185,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderan este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)"
186,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llegá- llegáran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)"
187,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!"
188,3,1,Kelly,We are?
189,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us."
190,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back."
191,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, really? Could you brush it off? [shows her backpack, and a huge insect half her size growls on it]"
192,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Um, no."
193,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[panics] Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! [the insect growls and falls silent. Miss Stevens returns] Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. [sees the insect, still on her back] Oh my God!! [runs off]"
194,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
195,3,1,Kelly,"Me, too! [the rest start to groan]"
196,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-"
197,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,[Kyle runs into an adult] Aaaaa! There's a dude here! [a soldier holding a shotgun]
198,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost. [giggles] Cah heh, can you help us?"
199,3,1,Solider,¿Qué?
200,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[moves forward] Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. [the soldier listens] We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. [rubs his belly]"
201,3,1,Stan Marsh,"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme."
202,3,1,Eric Cartman,Y taco.
203,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
204,3,1,Eric Cartman,Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
205,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. [the soldier points a way out with his thumb] Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! [they leave]"
206,3,1,Stan Marsh,This doesn't look very safe.
207,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
208,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government. [addresses them with a lilt] Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?"
209,3,1,People s Army Leader,[crisp] Who are you?!
210,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. [the soldiers just stare] We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? [no response] Um... [thinks] Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song [she moves aside]"
211,3,1,Kids,"Honh. [she presses the play button, and the song plays. The kids begin to dance]"
212,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[through clenched teeth] Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography. [as the chorus nears, Kyle is still doing the wrong moves] Oh, Kyle, please! [the kids dance through the first line of the chorus...]"
213,3,1,People s Army Leader,Enough! [the music stops]
214,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts."
215,3,1,People s Army Leader,"We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?"
216,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?"
217,3,1,People s Army Leader,"Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi. [the other men begin to laugh] Now, get out of here before we kill you!"
218,3,1,Miss Stevens,[sullen] Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
219,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Hey!
220,3,1,People s Army Leader,"[the soldier next to him cocks his shotgun] You white Americans make me sick! [emphasizes his disgust with thumps on the table] You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers."
221,3,1,People s Army Leader,"[waving the choir away] ¡Rapido, rapido! [Kenny steps in front of Kelly to shield her from any shots coming their way]"
222,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Run, children, run! [the choir moves out]"
223,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,¡¿Donde putos está el coro?! ¡El espectáculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)
224,3,1,Mr Mackey,"No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estáran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)"
225,3,1,Miss Stevens,Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
226,3,1,Choir Boy,"Wow, look at the pretty flower. [stops by to touch a huge yellow flower with blue support on a large green stalk]"
227,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay? [before she could finish the sentence, the flower wraps its petals around Jake and pulls him off the floor.]"
228,3,1,Jake,"Aaaah. Ugh, help!"
229,3,1,Miss Stevens,[quakes] Ga-ow! [quickly grabs Jake's feet and pulls. The choir walks on]
230,3,1,Kelly,[crying and pouting] I wanna go home! [Kenny stops and turns] I hate the rainforest!
231,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"[walks up and puts his arm around her] Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear. [comforted, she smiles]"
232,3,1,Kelly,"[gushing] Oh Lenny, hold me. [moves away] No, I can't get attached. [pause, then moves closer] Oh, but I do like you."
233,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Well, I like you-"
234,3,1,Kelly,"[moves away] Oh, but you're only going to leave me."
235,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"[pissed] Oh, God damn it!"
236,3,1,Short Reporter,"We're here live in San José, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril."
237,3,1,Slim Reporter,"That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, ""Getting Gay With Kids,"" all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment."
238,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[the problems mount] Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job! [another large insect roars behind her backpack, and she jumps] Aaaah!"
239,3,1,Eric Cartman,[turns and walks back the way they came] This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
240,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Eric, where are you going?"
241,3,1,Eric Cartman,I'm going this way!
242,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!"
243,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[stops] Look: you can stay over nyah [gestures towards her], but I'm going over nyah. [Gestures away from her]"
244,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Young man, I have had it!!"
245,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Nononono! You nyah, me nyah! [gestures forward and backward] Screw you guys, I'ma going home. [walks away]"
246,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard! [the others watch him leave] Eric, we have to stay together!"
247,3,1,Eric Cartman,God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat- [finds himself at a clearing full of bulldozers moving wood around] Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! [rushes in]
248,3,1,Stan Marsh,Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
249,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. It happened once before.
250,3,1,Miss Stevens,No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
251,3,1,Eric Cartman,[reaches the foreman] Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
252,3,1,Foreman,"What are you doing here, little boy?"
253,3,1,Eric Cartman,"I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!"
254,3,1,Foreman,"Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?"
255,3,1,Eric Cartman,Food! I have to have food! [falls on his face]
256,3,1,Fireman,"Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!"
257,3,1,Eric Cartman,[lifts his head] Chicken wings. [drops it]
258,3,1,Foreman,Chicken wings!
259,3,1,Eric Cartman,[lifts his head] Medium spicy. [drops it]
260,3,1,Crowd,Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!
261,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"La gente está ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)"
262,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Estoy seguro que llegáran. Eh-solo poquito mas de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)"
263,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos. [heads for center stage] (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)"
264,3,1,Mr Mackey,Mbien.
265,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"[on the mike] ¿A cuantos Polacos les toma a comerse un burrito? [the crowd is silent. He holds up two fingers] Dos. [seeing no reaction, he laughs, then tries again] ¿A cuantos Polacos les toma a manejar a Panamá? (How many Pollacks does it take to eat a burrito? Two. How many Pollacks does it take to drive to Panama?)"
266,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!"
267,3,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? [a column of smoke is seen floating above the canopy]"
268,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Let's go, quickly! [they rush towards the column and find a small campfire]"
269,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. [the shrubs around them rustle, and they face the shrubs. Some big-lipped dwarves surround them.]"
270,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Children, it's the Yanogapa. [to the dwarves] Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest. [the group is surrounded by spear-bearing Yanogapa men.]"
271,3,1,Yanogapa 1,Damtilié?
272,3,1,Yanogapa 2,Damtilié?
273,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[marveling] Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble... [the Yanogapa raise their spears high] Run for your lives, children!"
274,3,1,Stan Marsh,Holy crap! [all run]
275,3,1,The Yanogapa (with Giant Yanogapa),[giving chase and throwing spears] Damtilié! Damtilié! Damtilié!
276,3,1,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
277,3,1,Miss Stevens,Run run ruuun! [A huge insect lands on her backpack and roars. She looks back and the insect flies away] Waaah!
278,3,1,Kelly,"[trips and falls down] Aaaaa! Lenny! [Kenny goes back, helps her up, and they keep running. The choir runs across a puddle of quicksand and begin to sink]"
279,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell?
280,3,1,Stan Marsh,We're sinking.
281,3,1,Miss Stevens,"It's quicksand, people! [the Yanogapa warriors surround them and leap with excitement, still screaming ""Damtilié!""]"
282,3,1,Stan Marsh,"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""!"
283,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! Fragile my ass!
284,3,1,Kelly,"Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! [snuggles up to him]"
285,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Kelly, you said it!) [she tries to pick her nose, but the ropes won't let her]"
286,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[put off] Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people? [a giant Yanogapa rises from the brush and his voice rumbles across the rainforest. She responds] AAAAA!!"
287,3,1,Kelly,"Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!"
288,3,1,Miss Stevens,"All right, that does it!! [the men stop dancing] Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!! [the giant Yanogapa is shocked] I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!"
289,3,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, now she figures it out."
290,3,1,Foreman,Quick! Everybody help the children!
291,3,1,Stan Marsh,Wow!
292,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Bulldozers rule!
293,3,1,Foreman,[cutting the ropes off the kids] Come on! Let's get you back to civilization!
294,3,1,Kids,HOORAY!!
295,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[being cut down by a worker] Hooray, children!"
296,3,1,Miss Stevens,How did you know where we were?
297,3,1,Foreman,Your little friend helped me out.
298,3,1,Miss Stevens,Eric?
299,3,1,Eric Cartman,[arriving] Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
300,3,1,Miss Stevens,"What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?"
301,3,1,Foreman,We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard.
302,3,1,Miss Stevens,Really? [excited] That's great!!
303,3,1,Foreman,"You mean, you don't mind?"
304,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!"
305,3,1,Foreman,That’s swell!
306,3,1,Kelly,"Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day."
307,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Okay. I can do that. [lightning strikes him, knocking her away] (Christ!) [he falls, she gets up and goes to him]"
308,3,1,Kelly,Aaaah! Lenny! No! [Stan and Kyle rush in]
309,3,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
310,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
311,3,1,Kelly,[turns to face them] Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!
312,3,1,Stan Marsh,They did.
313,3,1,Kelly,"Who's ""they""?!"
314,3,1,Stan Marsh,"[pause] You know, ""they."""
315,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,They're... they're bastards.
316,3,1,Kelly,"Well don't just stand there, help him!!"
317,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?
318,3,1,Stan Marsh,Help ...him?
319,3,1,Kelly,"Aaagh! [turns around and pounds on Kenny's chest] Come on, Benny! Breathe! [she tries giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, then pounds on his chest again] Breathe, you son of a bitch! [she picks her nose, then pounds some more. Kenny coughs, and she listens]"
320,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
321,3,1,Summit Host,"And now, here to teach us about the rainforest is Getting Gay With Kids. [the crowd applauds]"
322,3,1,Miss Stevens,Does everybody remember the new lyrics? [the kids nod yes] And…
323,3,1,The New Lyrics,"[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing] There's a place called the rainforest; it truly sucks ass.
[Women sing] Let's knock it all down and get rid of it fast.
[Men sing] You say, ""Save the rainforest,"" but what do you know?
[All sing] You've never been to the rainforest before.
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle still can't dance]
To tell you things you might not like to hear. [Kenny and Kelly exchange glances]
You only fight these causes 'cause caring sells.
All you activists can go fuck yourselves!"
324,3,1,Male Activist,That was so inspiring.
325,3,1,Female Activist,What a wonderful message.
326,3,2,Stan Marsh,"[with an air pump] Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?"
327,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I don't think so."
328,3,2,Kenny McCormick,[bringing a hair dryer] How about this?
329,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, that's a hair dryer!"
330,3,2,General Store Manager,May I help you find something?
331,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?"
332,3,2,General Store Manager,Any what?
333,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,I need to get a nurection for my dad.
334,3,2,General Store Manager,"Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it. [gestures to the exit with his thumb]"
335,3,2,Stan Marsh,Why is that funny?
336,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one. [the boys are suddenly outside, with the door slamming shut behind them] Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? [the boys walk away]"
337,3,2,Stan Marsh,That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
338,3,2,Kenny McCormick,"You guys, take it seriously."
339,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
340,3,2,Man,[walks by with his lady] What?
341,3,2,Kenny McCormick,"Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town."
342,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?"
343,3,2,Kenny McCormick,"Yeah, you guys. Seriously."
344,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-"
345,3,2,Kenny McCormick,Ach. [Poof. Stan and Kyle turn. All three are left looking at a charred body]
346,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
347,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
348,3,2,Eric Cartman,What the hell happened to him?
349,3,2,Stan Marsh,He just... ignited.
350,3,2,Man,[rushing up] What happened?
351,3,2,Woman,[rushing up] I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. [Barbrady drives up and screeches to a halt]
352,3,2,Officer Barbrady,"[rushes up to the boys] Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room."
353,3,2,Blond Man,I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.
354,3,2,Man 2,Is it contagious?
355,3,2,Woman,Am I going to spontaneously combust?
356,3,2,Man 3,I hope it doesn't happen to me.
357,3,2,Woman,This is very scary.
358,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
359,3,2,Randy Marsh,"...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist."
360,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,Right.
361,3,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth."
362,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park. [Randy begins to daydream]"
363,3,2,Crowd,Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
364,3,2,Man,"We love you, Randy."
365,3,2,Woman,"[rushing up] Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
366,3,2,Randy Marsh,Wow.
367,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!"
368,3,2,Randy Marsh,Or else what?
369,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,[pounds on her desk] Exactly!
370,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on."
371,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. [The boys hop off the bier and move to the front row for the service as Priest Maxi approaches the coffin. He opens the Bible and reads]
372,3,2,Priest Maxi,"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays [Kevin falls asleep, Stuart reads Gazongas magazine and checks out its centerfold while his wife sniffs], the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy…"
373,3,2,Mr Garrison,"[to man to his left] Oh, here comes the guilt trip again."
374,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Now, let us pray. [all close their eyes and bow their heads] Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen."
375,3,2,All,Amen.
376,3,2,Priest Maxi,[raises left arm and fist] Let's go-
377,3,2,All,Let’s go
378,3,2,Priest Maxi,Broncos
379,3,2,All,Broncos
380,3,2,Priest Maxi,Let’s go Broncos
381,3,2,All,"Broncos, let's go! [The priest extends the fist and all rise and exit. Three men carry the coffin out]"
382,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Wow, that was short. [Priest Maxi stops them as they leave the pew]"
383,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately."
384,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I'm Jewish."
385,3,2,Priest Maxi,"You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?"
386,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,I guess not.
387,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?"
388,3,2,Stan Marsh,The what?
389,3,2,Priest Maxi,"It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ."
390,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!"
391,3,2,Priest Maxi,Huh?
392,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,We'll do it! We'll do it!
393,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys. [hands it to Kyle and walks away. The cover shows two excited kids under a radiant cross]"
394,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?"
395,3,2,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible."
396,3,2,Tom,"Good night, Jerry."
397,3,2,Jerry,"See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen."
398,3,2,Helen,"Bye, Jer- aaa! [poof. Now she combusted]"
399,3,2,Jerry,"Oh my God, another one."
400,3,2,Tom,"Helen, no!"
401,3,2,Jerry,What happened?
402,3,2,Man 5,"[consoling Tom] God must be very angry with us. But why? [looks to the heavens] How have we angered you, Lord?"
403,3,2,Randy Marsh,"[to himself] Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no."
404,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Dad, where's our Bible?"
405,3,2,Randy Marsh,"Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else."
406,3,2,Stan Marsh,Or else what?
407,3,2,Randy Marsh,Exactly.
408,3,2,Stan Marsh,...What?
409,3,2,Randy Marsh,Right.
410,3,2,Stan Marsh,[after a long pause] Where's our Bible?
411,3,2,Randy Marsh,"It's in the attic with the old LP's. [the boys start up the stairs...] Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?"
412,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
413,3,2,Randy Marsh,New girlfriend?
414,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?"
415,3,2,Randy Marsh,Maybe nothing... [close up] maybe everything.
416,3,2,Stan Marsh,"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. [the boys go up the stairs and exit]"
417,3,2,Randy Marsh,"[resumes the reactions] Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do. [the door closes] What?!"
418,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets."
419,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,This is gonna be fun.
420,3,2,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna be Jesus!
421,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,You're too fat to be Jesus!
422,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!"
423,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,Stan should be Jesus.
424,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! [gestures his intent.]"
425,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,You're such a fat baby!
426,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. [gestures again, and again]"
427,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!"
428,3,2,Eric Cartman,"[retorts] Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't."
429,3,2,Randy Marsh,"All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him. [four men dressed as the boys stand before him] Now, walk. [the men move around] Do you feel hot?"
430,3,2,Kenny McCormick,"Uh, no."
431,3,2,Randy Marsh,Damn it! How come you're not combusting? [throws down his clipboard]
432,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight."
433,3,2,Townsman,[rushing in with several other people] Another one! Another one combusted! [pours out the ashes for Randy to see]
434,3,2,Randy Marsh,No! Has she been doing anything odd?
435,3,2,Townsman,"No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house."
436,3,2,Randy Marsh,Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
437,3,2,Eric Cartman,"This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home. [walks off]"
438,3,2,Randy Marsh,No! I think I might have it.
439,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little ""nervous"" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?"
440,3,2,A few people,Yeah.
441,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things. [all bow their heads] Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen. [Stan and Kyle approach the pulpit, followed by Cartman] And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross. [leaves, and Stan takes over]"
442,3,2,Crowd,Awww.
443,3,2,Stan Marsh,Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
444,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Die! [hits Cartman, dressed as Jesus, with a stick]"
445,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God."
446,3,2,Crowd,Awww.
447,3,2,Someone,Phew.
448,3,2,Stan Marsh,Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
449,3,2,Eric Cartman,"[now carrying the cross] This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak."
450,3,2,Stan Marsh,"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. [this is not part of the Stations]"
451,3,2,Eric Cartman,Peter!
452,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know you, dude."
453,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess."
454,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,Mayor.
455,3,2,Randy Marsh,"[calling from his lab] Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust."
456,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,Why?
457,3,2,Randy Marsh,Dialog
458,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park."
459,3,2,Crowd,Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
460,3,2,Man,"We love you, Randy."
461,3,2,Woman,"[rushing up] Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
462,3,2,Randy Marsh,Wow. [hangs up the phone]
463,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,[hangs up the phone] Shmuck!
464,3,2,Stan Marsh,Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. [Kyle has tied Cartman to it]
465,3,2,Eric Cartman,Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
466,3,2,Stan Marsh,"[produces a crown of thorns] Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks."""
467,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven. [Stan replaces Cartman's cap with the crown] So I guess it's cool. [Stan returns to the pulpit]"
468,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Mom, please can we just leave?"
469,3,3,Liane Cartman,"You have to see the eye doctor, Eric."
470,3,3,Eric Cartman,But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
471,3,3,Liane Cartman,"You're not fat, you're big-boned."
472,3,3,Eric Cartman,"That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason."
473,3,3,Doctor s assistant,"[at the door, flatly] Eric Cartman. [a poster behind her looks like her]"
474,3,3,Eric Cartman,[enters the examination room] Weak. [the assistant follows him in to close the door.]
475,3,3,Optometrist,"Hello, Eric."
476,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[resigned] Hi, Doctor Lout."
477,3,3,Dr Lott,How's my little piggy today?
478,3,3,Eric Cartman,[points his finger at him] Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
479,3,3,Dr Lott,I just say that because you're my little buddy.
480,3,3,Eric Cartman,"I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!"
481,3,3,Dr Lott,Hop up on the chair. [Cartman hops up] Don't break it now!
482,3,3,Eric Cartman,[turns around and sits] God damn it!
483,3,3,Dr Lott,Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing. [lowering a refractor to Cartman's eyes] All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
484,3,3,Eric Cartman,Yes.
485,3,3,Dr Lott,"All right, read them out for me."
486,3,3,Eric Cartman,I am a little piggy. Ey! [the optometrist laughs. Cartman stands up on the chair and pushes the refractor away.] That does it! Mom!
487,3,3,Dr Lott,"No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence. [voice fades as he removes the card from the refractor] I do not know how that happened. [reads the card] ""I am a little piggy."" Wow! What are the odds of that? [throws it away] All right, let's get down to business, shall we? [places the refractor back on Cartman's face.]"
488,3,3,Eric Cartman,Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
489,3,3,Dr Lott,"[begins to calibrate] Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?"
490,3,3,Eric Cartman,They look exactly the same.
491,3,3,Dr Lott,Just pick one. Or two.
492,3,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, two!"
493,3,3,Dr Lott,"[flips between two women] Okay. One, or two? One, or two?"
494,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh, one."
495,3,3,Dr Lott,"[flips between an apple and a tall slice of chocolate cake] One, or two? One, or two?"
496,3,3,Eric Cartman,[chooses the cake] Two.
497,3,3,Dr Lott,"No! The answer is one, piggy! One! [hits Cartman through the refractor]"
498,3,3,Eric Cartman,Ow! I hate you!
499,3,3,Dr Lott,"[removes the refractor] Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests."
500,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
501,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch."
502,3,3,Kenny McCormick,Maybe he took a dump and got sick. [the others laugh]
503,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [sees Cartman] Oh, here he comes."
504,3,3,Eric Cartman,[with very dilated pupils] Hey dudes.
505,3,3,Stan Marsh,"[squints hard for a better look] Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? [Kyle blinks hard]"
506,3,3,Eric Cartman,My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
507,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
508,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!"
509,3,3,Stan Marsh,Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
510,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do."
511,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do."
512,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, yeah! [The four enter the kitchen, but Cartman runs into the entrance and falls on his way in.] Ow!"
513,3,3,The Boys,Hey Chef!
514,3,3,Mr Derp,"[wearing a hairnet and cook's cap] Hello there, children."
515,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[rubs his eyes] Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy."
516,3,3,Mr Derp,It's time for lunch-e-roo.
517,3,3,Stan Marsh,Where's Chef?
518,3,3,Mr Derp,Chef quit.
519,3,3,The Boys,What?!
520,3,3,Mr Derp,"Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp. [ta-daaa!]"
521,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Derp?
522,3,3,Mr Derp,"When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp. [ta-daaa! Mr. Derp hits himself with a hammer and toddles] Ooo! Derp! [falls to the floor, then gets up] Derp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids? [laughs, but the boys aren't impressed]"
523,3,3,Stan Marsh,Why did Chef quit?
524,3,3,Mr Derp,"Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone. [takes out a tiny cannon and shoots himself with it. His face is full of gunpowder] Oh, I don't feel so good. [laughs] Derp!"
525,3,3,Stan Marsh,[after a moment of silence] Could you just hand us some food please?
526,3,3,Mr Derp,"Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!"
527,3,3,Eric Cartman,Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
528,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
529,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back."
530,3,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. [chuckles]"
531,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks back] Shut up, Cartman!"
532,3,3,Eric Cartman,[runs into the door] Ow!
533,3,3,Chef,"[wrapped in a lavender towel, opens the door] Oh! Hello there, children!"
534,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today."
535,3,3,Chef,Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
536,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but we didn't believe them."
537,3,3,Chef,"Well, it's true."
538,3,3,Stan Marsh,But why? Why would you quit?
539,3,3,Chef,"Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off."
540,3,3,Stan Marsh,So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
541,3,3,Chef,"No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked."
542,3,3,Stan Marsh,Talked?!
543,3,3,Chef,"Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself."
544,3,3,Woman,[walks up and looks out] Oh! What darling little children.
545,3,3,Chef,"Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica."
546,3,3,Stan Marsh,"[ignoring that statement] That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!"
547,3,3,Chef,"Children, Veronica is moving in with me."
548,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Moving in?!
549,3,3,Chef,I'm in love.
550,3,3,Boys,Love?!
551,3,3,Veronica,"Oh, you knight. [cuddles Chef]"
552,3,3,Stan Marsh,What the hell is going on?!
553,3,3,Chef,Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
554,3,3,Veronica,"[teasing] Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you."
555,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better."
556,3,3,Chef,"Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too."
557,3,3,Veronica,What's the problem?
558,3,3,Eric Cartman,"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean."
559,3,3,Veronica,"Oh, I know just the song for you.
[reaches behind the door and pulls out a guitar. She starts to play it]
There's got to be a morning after
if we can hold on to the night
[the boys are shocked, and Kenny pulls his hood tight]"
560,3,3,Chef,[blandly] We have a chance to find the sunshine.
561,3,3,Chef,
562,3,3,Veronica,
563,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"This... is insane. [""Oh, can't you see the-""]"
564,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,That bitch!
565,3,3,Stan Marsh,She's stealing Chef from us.
566,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,She didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
567,3,3,Eric Cartman,Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
568,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Wait you guys. [pensive] Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? [the others think about it...]"
569,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, so?"
570,3,3,Stan Marsh,"...Yeah, screw that bitch."
571,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Bitch, I hate that bitch!"
572,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around."
573,3,3,Stan Marsh,Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
574,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Good idea.
575,3,3,Dr Lott,"All right, we got the test results back, piggy-"
576,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[sits on the chair, his pupils normal again] Stop calling me piggy!"
577,3,3,Dr Lott,You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
578,3,3,Eric Cartman,"So, what does that mean?"
579,3,3,Dr Lott,"It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better."
580,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[seething] All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair [throws a fit] and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!"
581,3,3,Dr Lott,"Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. [puts a pair of blocky glasses on Cartman]"
582,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[after seeing how they look and fit] Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me."
583,3,3,Dr Lott,"I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses."
584,3,3,Eric Cartman,I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
585,3,3,Dr Lott,That's why we have the little stapler. [takes it out and starts stapling the glasses to Cartman's head]
586,3,3,Eric Cartman,Ow! Son of a bitch!
587,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,They said that Chef works in one of these buildings [the boys run into Cartman in front of Steinburg & Burgstein Accounting.
588,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey dudes. [the others study him, then laugh. Cartman is hurt, but jabs] Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!"
589,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Just take them off!
590,3,3,Eric Cartman,"I can't! They're stapled to my head! [they study him again, then laugh harder.] I hate you guys."
591,3,3,Receptionist,Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
592,3,3,Stan Marsh,We wanna talk to Chef.
593,3,3,Receptionist,Chef?
594,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"He's a big guy, with a beard."
595,3,3,Stan Marsh,And a chef hat.
596,3,3,Kenny McCormick,(And a real huge dick.)
597,3,3,Receptionist,Oh! The black guy!
598,3,3,Stan Marsh,Huh?
599,3,3,Receptionist,"Third cubicle on the left [directs them to the work area, where Chef's hat can be seen, but stops Cartman] Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?"
600,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[dismissively] Uh, yeah, sure sure."
601,3,3,Receptionist,Wow! You really got fat.
602,3,3,Eric Cartman,Ey!
603,3,3,Chef,"Hello there, children."
604,3,3,Hey,Dialog
605,3,3,Chef,Dialog
606,3,3,Chef,"Eric, you got glasses!"
607,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Chef, you have to dump the bitch!"
608,3,3,Chef,Huh?
609,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We need you, Chef."
610,3,3,Man,"[pops up from another cubicle] Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?"
611,3,3,Chef,You bet! [the guy grins]
612,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, this place isn't you!"
613,3,3,Chef,"Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old."
614,3,3,Stan Marsh,But we don't like her.
615,3,3,Chef,Why not??
616,3,3,Stan Marsh,I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
617,3,3,Chef,"Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day."
618,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No way, dude!"
619,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses."
620,3,3,Chef,That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
621,3,3,Eric Cartman,Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
622,3,3,Chef,You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
623,3,3,Kids,Okay!
624,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Chef should be here any minute.
625,3,3,Stan Marsh,[pissed] Dude! He bailed on us!
626,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,[pissed] I can't believe it!
627,3,3,Stan Marsh,Come on! We're going to his house! [they leave the bus stop]
628,3,3,Chef,"Oh! Uh, hello there, children."
629,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!"
630,3,3,Chef,"Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot."
631,3,3,Stan Marsh,[sarcastic] You forgot!
632,3,3,Chef,Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner. [dreamy] She's so amazing.
633,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!"
634,3,3,Veronica,"[appears behind Chef] Hello, children!"
635,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?"
636,3,3,Chef,"Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. [a dramatic riff signals the boys' alarm]"
637,3,3,Stan Marsh,Oh no! No nononononono!
638,3,3,Chef,"My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too."
639,3,4,Eric Cartman,"You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"":
[plays four notes before each line]
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
[the other three glare at him] I hate him the most.}}
{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys. Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny."
640,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen. [""Hey you guys, sing the song!""] Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... [Cartman gets up and walks away]"
641,3,4,Stan Marsh,Where are you going?
642,3,4,Eric Cartman,I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
643,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Just go behind a tree.
644,3,4,Eric Cartman,I have to go number two.
645,3,4,Stan Marsh,So? You can poo in the wilderness.
646,3,4,Eric Cartman,"No way, dude! What would I wipe with?"
647,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!"
648,3,4,Eric Cartman,Well what do I sit on?
649,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You just squat, stupid! [Cartman begins to lower his pants...]"
650,3,4,Stan Marsh,Not here! Go further away!
651,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[moves away] God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules! [he squats some distance away and begins] Urgh. Come on, now."
652,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Watch out for ground eels! [he, Stan and Kenny begin to laugh]"
653,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Stop, you guys! I can't think!"
654,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,What do you have to think about?
655,3,4,Eric Cartman,"I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream... [a dump is heard] Oh, that did it."
656,3,4,Stan Marsh,"Sick, dude!"
657,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Poopin' outside,
[a rear shot] Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?
[a yellow creature peeks out between the trees. It is the one looking at Cartman's rear.]"
658,3,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Here you go.) [begins to walk to Cartman, but realizes what it's to be used for] (No way!) [goes back to roasting his marshmallow]"
659,3,4,Eric Cartman,[hears some rustling and zips up immediately] What the?
660,3,4,Creature,[running through the trees] Oohma poota!
661,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!"
662,3,4,Stan Marsh,"[thinking of poo] We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!"
663,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[urging] You guys, get over here!"
664,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No way, dude!"
665,3,4,Eric Cartman,I'm serious now! [the boys walk over to the spot] Look. Over by those bushes.
666,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?
667,3,4,Creature,Meesa scared!
668,3,4,Stan Marsh,I see it!
669,3,4,Eric Cartman,Come on! Let's kill it! [the boys move forward]
670,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps in the poo and looks at his shoe] Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!"
671,3,4,Announcer,Look at this sword. Only on House Shopping Network. It has a dragon on the blade. [close-up of the samurai sword] It's got a dragon painted right on the blade! You should buy the samurai sw-
672,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?! [Ned tries to speak] I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!"
673,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,[eructing] Shut... up... Jimbo.
674,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out."
675,3,4,Stan Marsh,[outside] I saw it this way!
676,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Over here!
677,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[trying to keep up] Come on, you guys!"
678,3,4,Jimbo Kern,[opens the door] What the hell's goin' on?!
679,3,4,Stan Marsh,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!"
680,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on! [goes in, and reappears with his gun. Ned follows him out the door] Where did it go?"
681,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,It just ran by here a second ago. [rustling is heard]
682,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"[cocks the shotgun] Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap! [all move slowly around a corner] Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. [turns it on and flashes it into the trap]"
683,3,4,Creature,Ooba jaaga!
684,3,4,Jimbo Kern,Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
685,3,4,Creature,Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop!
686,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny."
687,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,[annoyed] It's stupid.
688,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, let's kill it."
689,3,4,Eric Cartman,[intervening] No! No. Don't.
690,3,4,Jimbo Kern,Huh?
691,3,4,Eric Cartman,I like it.
692,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't like anything, Cartman! [the creature is shaking from fright, and Cartman looks at it affectionately]"
693,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it."
694,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. [the crowd murmurs and the creature just stares out of the cage. His view is that of a fish lens]"
695,3,4,Sheila,"[walks up to it] Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. [three men with briefcases walk up]"
696,3,4,FED,"Mayor, we're from the Department of Interior."
697,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Ooh, yes. How are you?"
698,3,4,DOI 1,"[the one with black hair] Fine, just fine."
699,3,4,DOI 2,"[the one with red hair] Fine, just fine."
700,3,4,DOI 3,[the one with brown hair] Fine.
701,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,Right over here. [she shows them the creature and they stare in awe]
702,3,4,DOI 2,"My God, McClanahan, do you believe it? [DOI 3 is just stunned]"
703,3,4,Creature,Meesa needa Jakov. [raises its arms] Dwooooooo!
704,3,4,DOI 1,Mm-it's amazing.
705,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,What?
706,3,4,DOI 1,"Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen."
707,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, neato."
708,3,4,DOI 2,Incredible. [turns to look at the Mayor] We know of this creature only from remains frozen in snow.
709,3,4,DOI 1,Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
710,3,4,Eric Cartman,Wow! Cool!
711,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,[eructing] Is... there... re... ward... money? [the DOI agents look at him]
712,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!"
713,3,4,DOI 2,This one jakovasaur can mother an entire population of the animals.
714,3,4,Woman,"Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope."
715,3,4,Woman 2,Hope.
716,3,4,Man,"Yes, Hope."
717,3,4,Hope (Junjun),Meesa name Junjun.
718,3,4,Stan Marsh,I think his name is Junjun.
719,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!"
720,3,4,DOI 1,Now we must find a safe place for it.
721,3,4,Mr Garrison,I'll keep it at my house.
722,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!"
723,3,4,Junjun,Uuh?!
724,3,4,Mr Garrison,What?! How dare you say that?!
725,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!"
726,3,4,Mr Garrison,"Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut."
727,3,4,Rancher,"Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated."
728,3,4,DOI 1,"Well, that sounds fine, just fine."
729,3,4,DOI 3,"Fine, just fine."
730,3,4,DOI 2,Fine.
731,3,4,Mr Garrison,"Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon? [everyone around him raises his or her hand] Oh, whatever!"
732,3,4,Announcer,It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword-
733,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[wondering] Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??"
734,3,4,Liane Cartman,"[from somewhere else] I'll think about it, hon."
735,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Sweet. [someone knocks on the front door] Mom, somebody's at the door."
736,3,4,Liane Cartman,"Mommy's busy, boopie-kins."
737,3,4,Eric Cartman,Should I get it?
738,3,4,Liane Cartman,"[in bed, with torch and bong in hand] Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends."
739,3,4,Eric Cartman,Okay.
740,3,4,Liane Cartman,"[inhales, with a manly voice] Hmmm. [two men are in bed with her. One of them is her congressman, O'Reilly]"
741,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold your horses! God! [opens the door and screams. An angry jakovasaur glares at him. Cartman backs into the living room] Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!"
742,3,4,Liane Cartman,"That's nice, muffin."
743,3,4,Jakovasaur,"Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-oh. [falls on his face and gets up] Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick."
744,3,4,Eric Cartman,You mean the other jakovasaur?
745,3,4,Jakovasaur,What means a jakovasaur?
746,3,4,Eric Cartman,You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
747,3,4,Jakovasaur,Oh. Cool beans.
748,3,4,Eric Cartman,But the other jakovasaur talked different.
749,3,4,Jakovasaur,That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different.
750,3,4,Eric Cartman,I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
751,3,4,Jakovasaur,Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.
752,3,4,Eric Cartman,"He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. [the others stay silent, looking at him]"
753,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
754,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!"
755,3,4,Jakovasaur,"[hidden] Eric, do you have any more cookies? [Cartman turns his head aside and grins]"
756,3,4,Stan Marsh,Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
757,3,4,Eric Cartman,"No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. [the closet door opens and the jakovasaur comes out]"
758,3,4,Stan Marsh,Wow!
759,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Jakov, I want you to meet my friends."
760,3,4,Jakov,"Huhello, guys. I love new friends. [trips and flies across the room, then clears his head. A rattling noise is heard]"
761,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?"
762,3,4,Stan Marsh,"[put off] No, he's annoying."
763,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,What are we supposed to do with him?
764,3,4,Eric Cartman,We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
765,3,4,Stan Marsh,Why don't we just tell our parents?
766,3,4,Eric Cartman,No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
767,3,4,Stan Marsh,[softly] Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.
768,3,4,Jakov,[sees his mate and can't help it] Junjun!
769,3,4,Stan Marsh,"[softly, curtly] Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!"
770,3,4,Jakov,"[rushes up to her] Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay! [she's sitting on some hay]"
771,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[softly, curtly] Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!"
772,3,4,Jakov,"[turns around] I am whispering! [steps on a rake, whose handle smacks him on the head] Yyeow!"
773,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[laughing] Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov."
774,3,4,Jakov,[soothing his head] I am?
775,3,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?"
776,3,4,Jakov,"Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond. [the barn doors open to show the Mayor, the rancher, and the DOI agents looking quite angry.]"
777,3,4,Junjun,"Aw, we's in big doodoo now."
778,3,4,Jakov,Uh oh.
779,3,4,Operator,"Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?"
780,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"[eructing] Yes... Hello..., um..., I... lost... my... voice... box…"
781,3,4,Amanda,Excuse me?
782,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,I... lost... my... voice... box…
783,3,4,Amanda,[after a long pause] Excuse me?
784,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"[faster, after a pause] I... lost... my... voice... box... [Jimbo enters the room and Ned hangs up]"
785,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box! [Ned reaches for it, but Jimbo keeps it out of reach, teasing Ned] You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go. [hands him the box] Well, try it out!"
786,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"[crisply] Mmm. Aw, Jimbo, I can't thank you enough for the new voice box. Gmmm, now, what in the devil is this thing?"
787,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake."
788,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm-aw, what a bloody pickle this is! Did you keep the receipt, then?"
789,3,4,Man,[barges in] You guys come quick! I've only just heard!
790,3,4,Jimbo Kern,What? What is it?
791,3,4,Man,They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur! [silence]
792,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"Gmmm, blimey."
793,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,[on the mic] Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
794,3,4,DOI 1,"Thank you, Mayor. [takes over] The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back."
795,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[reading his acceptance speech] ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."""
796,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you doing, fatass?!"
797,3,4,Eric Cartman,"I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."""
798,3,4,DOI 1,"...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival."
799,3,4,Man,[amid much chatter] Yea for us!
800,3,4,Jakov,Thank you!
801,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!"
802,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[walks to the podium and speaks] Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction."
803,3,4,Man 2,"Well, that's about it. Let's go."
804,3,4,Man 3,Yeah. [the crowd begins to disperse]
805,3,4,Eric Cartman,"You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me... [finds himself all alone in the square] Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!"
806,3,4,Jakov,Wow!! It's so pretty!
807,3,4,DOI 1,"Well, Jakov, we hope this new home ""inspires"" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know... [the room falls silent]"
808,3,4,Jakov,What?
809,3,4,DOI 2,"Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs, so, maybe you two should uuh…"
810,3,4,Jakov,What?
811,3,4,DOI 3,Get to some business. [make a ring with the thumb and index finger of one hand and sticks the other index finger through the ring]
812,3,4,Jakov,[scratches his head] What??
813,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!"
814,3,4,Jakov,Ooohh.
815,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,[as the rest leave the house] We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.
816,3,4,Jakov,"Well, all right, then. [the Mayor closes the door]"
817,3,4,Junjun,Meesa just don't wanna!
818,3,4,Jakov,[walking out] I don't know what to do!
819,3,4,DOI 1,"Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your... [sees there's nothing where something should be] Hmmm. [stroke his chin] I guess we don't know exactly how jakovasaurs mate."
820,3,4,DOI 2,[holds his index finger up] There is... another option.
821,3,4,Dr. Mephesto,I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.
822,3,4,Jakov,I have seamen? Where's their boat? [imitates a fog horn] Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr! [Cartman laughs]
823,3,4,Dr. Mephesto,"Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov. [Jakov stops] I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked. [sticks a syringe into Junjun's arm and draws a blood sample. Junjun reacts immediately as Mephesto goes to his microscope]"
824,3,4,Junjun,Oh-wwoooooop! Oh-wwoooooop!
825,3,4,Jakov,[adds his reaction] Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
826,3,4,Stan Marsh,God-damn!
827,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Shut up!!
828,3,4,Dr. Mephesto,"Yes! Yes, I think it worked! [Jakov and Junjun stop as Mephesto turns to face the group] You are going to be parents!"
829,3,4,DOI 3,Yeah!
830,3,4,DOI 2,We did it!
831,3,4,Jakov,Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park!
832,3,4,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?"
833,3,4,Commentator,"...and Bubby Brister is having a great first quarter! Let's see what trickery he uses here. Here's the snap, and he's down-"
834,3,4,Jakov,"Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!"
835,3,4,Randy Marsh,"No problem, Jakov."
836,3,4,Commentator,To the 40-yard line!
837,3,4,Men,Yea!
838,3,4,Jakov,Go Niners! Ni-ners!
839,3,4,Gerald Broflovski,"We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!"
840,3,4,Jakov,Oooops!
841,3,4,Commentator,"...to Terrell Davis! He's at the 50, the 40, the 30,... [the men are happy]"
842,3,4,Jakov,"You guys know what? [they angrily snap their heads in his directions] This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-"
843,3,4,Commentator,"He breaks another tackle, and the ball is loose!"
844,3,4,Jakov,You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
845,3,4,Randy Marsh,"Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?"
846,3,4,Jakov,Sure. You got money?
847,3,4,Gerald Broflovski,[hands him some bills] Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
848,3,4,Jakov,"[gets up] Cool beans. [trips over the plug, knocking down the TV] Oopsie. I'll be right back. [closes the door]"
849,3,4,Mr Mackey,"Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay."
850,3,4,The Others,Yup.
851,3,4,DOI 1,Amazing! The gestation period was only four days.
852,3,4,DOI 2,"At that rate, we could repopulate the jakovasaurs in just a few years."
853,3,4,Junjun,Doe-wooop!
854,3,4,DOI 1,"Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine."
855,3,4,DOI 3,Just fine.
856,3,4,DOI 2,Fine.
857,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby."
858,3,4,Eric Cartman,"If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct."
859,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. [he and Stan laugh]"
860,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!"
861,3,4,DOI 2,Here we go.
862,3,4,Junjun,Doe-woooop!
863,3,4,Sheila,"[gushing] Behold, the miracle of childbirth!"
864,3,4,Junjun,Dowoop! [her water breaks and lands on everyone]
865,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Gross!
866,3,4,Junjun,Dowoop! [a baby jakovasaur is shot out and strikes the wall. It whimpers as it drops]
867,3,4,All,Hooray!
868,3,4,DOI 3,"This is the first step in bringing the species back from the brink of extinction! [the baby jakovasaur gets up and moves around, growling]"
869,3,4,Junjun,Dowoooop! Dowoop!
870,3,4,DOI 2,Looks like there might be a second one.
871,3,4,DOI 1,Wow! That would be a great start for them. [close-up of the second baby flying out of the vagina]
872,3,4,All,Hooray! [Junjun starts pumping babies out in all directions. The adults crouch behind the sofa for cover]
873,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,She's a cannon! [seventeen babies end up in front of the wall. The lead agent walks up to them]
874,3,4,DOI 1,"Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters."
875,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[picks up a baby and says sweetly] Aren't they cute, you guys?"
876,3,4,Stan Marsh,[to Kyle] Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
877,3,4,Junjun,Huh-owhoa-o-woop! [pumps out a second set of jakovasaurs]
878,3,4,DOI 1,Huh?! [getting out of the way] Whoa-o-whoa!
879,3,4,Mr Garrison,"Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. [the class is full of jakovasaur children]"
880,3,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's crowded in here."
881,3,4,Jakovasaur Boy,[sitting in front of Pip] I like school!
882,3,4,Jakovasaur Girl,Bo-woop!
883,3,4,Mr Garrison,"O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history. [starts writing on the board] Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972? [a jakovasaur kid in the front row raises his hand and waves it] Yes?"
884,3,4,Jakovasaur Boy,I don't know.
885,3,4,Jakovasaur Girl,Bo-woop!
886,3,4,Mr Garrison,"O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?"
887,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 1,[in front of Wendy] I can't.
888,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 2,Me neither.
889,3,4,Mr Garrison,"[angrily] Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!"
890,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 2,Oh.
891,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 3,O-wowo-oop! O-woo-oop!
892,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 4,Ooo! Fight! Fight! [he and another jakovasaur start to fight]
893,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 5,"School, school! I like school! [the fighting escalates]"
894,3,5,Voice,"[male] This is shop class. [it belongs to a heavyset man, who stands next to a chalkboard, pointing to the information] My name is Mr. Adler. For the next week, rather than your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning how to make things. Now, does anybody know WHY you're in shop class? [Stan raises his hand] Yes?"
895,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?"
896,3,5,Mr Adler,"Wrong! You are here because you are America's future! [stirring music plays] You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have... [points to the words] shop class."
897,3,5,Eric Cartman,Ooooohh.
898,3,5,Mr Adler,"Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a- [picks up a picture of a his fiancée and begins to get lost looking at it] I have... uh, I have a..."
899,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Adler?
900,3,5,Mr Adler,"[sets the picture down] Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?"
901,3,5,Stan Marsh,[quickly points] Tweek is!
902,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Arrh! No, I'm not!"
903,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble."
904,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Arrrrh!
905,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class."
906,3,5,Mr Adler,"That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?"
907,3,5,Craig Tucker,No.
908,3,5,Mr Adler,"Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we- [Craig flips him off] Hey! Did you just flip me off?!"
909,3,5,Craig Tucker,No.
910,3,5,Mr Adler,"Yes, you did!"
911,3,5,Eric Cartman,Told ya!
912,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[hushed, to Stan] Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec."
913,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls."
914,3,5,Voice,"[female] Welcome to home ec. [the camera scans across the class] For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty. [Kenny appears]"
915,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Woohooo!) [Wendy raises her hand]
916,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,"I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here."
917,3,5,Woman,"That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers. [now cautioning] But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec."
918,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Woohooo!) [the girls on either side of him look at him]
919,3,5,Eric Cartman,I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? [cuts out two slabs]
920,3,5,Stan Marsh,I don't know. He's such a wuss.
921,3,5,Mr Adler,[passing by] Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
922,3,5,Eric Cartman,"You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. [Craig leafs through some wood scraps, and Tweek approaches a belt sander on the floor]"
923,3,5,Stan Marsh,No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
924,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass."
925,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Do you wanna bet?
926,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'll bet."
927,3,5,Stan Marsh,How much?
928,3,5,Eric Cartman,Five bucks.
929,3,5,Stan Marsh,You're on!
930,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[revs up a belt sander.] Arrh!  [jumps. Stan and Kyle walk to him]
931,3,5,Stan Marsh,Hey Tweek.
932,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[jumps] Gaarhrhrh!
933,3,5,Stan Marsh,Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
934,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[drops the sander] He does?
935,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?"
936,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Why?
937,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? [Craig is still leafing through the scraps]"
938,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[jumps] Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
939,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Craig, could I talk to you real quick? [Craig flips him off, and Cartman puts his palms up to calm him] Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater."
940,3,5,Craig Tucker,He did?
941,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it."
942,3,5,Craig Tucker,Why would he say that?
943,3,5,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you."
944,3,5,Craig Tucker,"[now pissed] Well, I've gotta go over there and-"
945,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[blocks his way] No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today."
946,3,5,Craig Tucker,Okay. [flips Tweek off]
947,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
948,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[twitches to one side] Rrrr! What a jerk!
949,3,5,Stan Marsh,"He's really got it out for you, dude."
950,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Why?! What did I do?!
951,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"So, do you agree to fight him after school?"
952,3,5,Tweek Tweak,I guess so.
953,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Super. See you there. [they walk away, pleased]"
954,3,5,Fianc e,"[runs from him] Catch me, Richard. [she laughs even after he catches her and she's on the grass] I'm so in love with you, Richard. [next scene: she's in the kitchen holding a tray] I made you some cookies, Richard. [sniffs them real good. Next, she's by the fireplace with a little stocking] Merry Christmas, Richard. [laughing on the yard outside] Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. [in flight, trying to regain control] Aaaaaaa! [in a swimming pool, under water] Richard!"
955,3,5,Mr Adler,"Aaaarr! Uh. [opens a drawer to get some nicotine gum, and chews some] Oh why? Why? [closes his eyes and continues chewing]"
956,3,5,Stan Marsh,Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
957,3,5,Mr Adler,[opens his eyes] Huh? Stop screwing around!
958,3,5,Stan Marsh,The bell rang. Can we go?
959,3,5,Mr Adler,"Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed."
960,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Cartman follow him out.]"
961,3,5,Stan Marsh,"This is gonna be so sweet, dude."
962,3,5,Eric Cartman,You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
963,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,We'll see!
964,3,5,Eric Cartman,Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
965,3,5,Stan Marsh,"You're on, fatass! [Kenny shows up]"
966,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!"
967,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)"
968,3,5,Stan Marsh,"How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?"
969,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. That's not cool, dude. [the girls walk by]"
970,3,5,Bebe Stevens,"Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow."
971,3,5,Annie Knitts,"Bye, Kenny."
972,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Bye, ladies.) [the other boys arrive as the girls leave]"
973,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"Hey, what's going on?"
974,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
975,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"Really? Cool. [the boys stand around waiting] It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago."
976,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
977,3,5,Token Black,"Yeah, they left."
978,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw, hell!"
979,3,5,Eric Cartman,Those sons of bitches!
980,3,5,Clyde Donovan,I guess they don't wanna fight.
981,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! [walks off with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny]"
982,3,5,Stan Marsh,Tweek?
983,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,[looks up to the second floor] Tweek?
984,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[opens the center window] Arrh! What do you guys want?
985,3,5,Stan Marsh,"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!"
986,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
987,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Craig showed up."
988,3,5,Tweek Tweak,He did?
989,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"""
990,3,5,Tweek Tweak,I don't have crooked teeth!
991,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken; [Stan watches as Kyle demonstrates] well, everybody in the world saw it!"
992,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Everyone in the world?! Rrrr! [falls down behind the window]
993,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it was weak."
994,3,5,Tweek Tweak,I'm not a chicken!
995,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. [turns to walk away]"
996,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[pops up] Wait! I'll fight!
997,3,5,Stan Marsh,Tomorrow?
998,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Okay.
999,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!"
1000,3,5,Craig Tucker,Red Racer's on.
1001,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!"
1002,3,5,Craig Tucker,I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
1003,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[aloof] Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom."
1004,3,5,Craig Tucker,Nope. [shuts the door]
1005,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[hushed] Egh. God damn it! [knocks again, and Craig answers] Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig."
1006,3,5,Craig Tucker,What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
1007,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed."
1008,3,5,Craig Tucker,"That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!"
1009,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?"
1010,3,5,Craig Tucker,After Red Racer.
1011,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[being gracious] After Red Racer, of course."
1012,3,5,Richard Tweak,"How was school today, son?"
1013,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Errh!
1014,3,5,Richard Tweak,That's great.
1015,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??"
1016,3,5,Richard Tweak,"Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met. [gets up and stands next to her. Peaceful music plays] You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive."
1017,3,5,Mrs Tweak,It's true. I was. [Tweek bobs as he listens]
1018,3,5,Richard Tweak,"Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight. [sits down, and both parent resume eating. Tweek waits for the rest of the story.]"
1019,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[after a long lull] Well?
1020,3,5,Mrs Tweak,"Well what, honey?"
1021,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Nrr. What happened?
1022,3,5,Richard Tweak,"Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something."
1023,3,5,Mrs Tweak,"Yes, I think that's right."
1024,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Rrrrr! You guys never help me! [the parents look at each other, and Tweek starts banging his head against the table] Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! [the parents resume eating]"
1025,3,5,Craig Tucker,"Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow."
1026,3,5,Thomas Tucker,With who?
1027,3,5,Craig Tucker,Some kid.
1028,3,5,Thomas Tucker,Oh.
1029,3,5,Laura Tucker,"Don't just ""Oh"" him, Thomas!"
1030,3,5,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me!"
1031,3,5,Thomas Tucker,"I'll ""Oh"" whoever I want! [Mrs. Tucker flips Thomas off, he flips back, the daughter flips them both off, and Craig flips his dad off with the right hand, his sister off with the left, and his mom with the right, up close.]"
1032,3,5,Mr Adler,"Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later."
1033,3,5,Pearl,"Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?"
1034,3,5,Mr Adler,Why?
1035,3,5,Pearl,"Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight."
1036,3,5,Mr Adler,"Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on."
1037,3,5,Pearl,"Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?"
1038,3,5,Mr Adler,"I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. [he begins closing the door]"
1039,3,5,Pearl,We'll use plastic wrap.
1040,3,5,Mr Adler,"Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time. [shuts the door on her face. He holds the door in place, then makes his way to a picture of his deceased love, picks it up, and remembers...]"
1041,3,5,Fianc e,"[on a swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard. [now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over] Smile. [now opens a little box and sees a ring] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do! [in flight, trying to regain control] Aaaaaaa! [in a swimming pool, under water] Richard! [now rising from an open coffin] Richard."
1042,3,5,Mr Adler,"[returns] Haaarrr! [opens a small drawer in the side table, gets some nicotine gum, and starts chewing, then mumbles] Aw, God, what am I gonna do? [resumes chewing]"
1043,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45."
1044,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?"
1045,3,5,Craig Tucker,I uh...
1046,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[covers Craig's mouth] However long Craig wants it to last. [the kids laugh] T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge."
1047,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
1048,3,5,Eric Cartman,Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
1049,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, fatass!!"
1050,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! [jumps on him, and they start fighting. Kenny and Stan soon join in, leaving Tweek and Craig looking at them]"
1051,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight."
1052,3,5,Pearl,"[stands by a chart equating shoes with money] On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes. [Kenny and the girls take notes. Pearl then stands by the chalkboard listing the number of credit cards from 1 to 4] When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE. [crosses 1 out] It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy. [crosses 4 out] The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two. [circles it. Bebe raises her hand]"
1053,3,5,Bebe Stevens,"What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?"
1054,3,5,Pearl,Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats. [the girls and Kenny just look at her]
1055,3,5,Eric Cartman,"When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world."
1056,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!"
1057,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000."
1058,3,5,Mr Adler,"Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! [He now hears a voice calling to him, from the drawers in his desk...]"
1059,3,5,Fianc e,"Ri-chard! [he whistles] Ri-chard! [he remembers mumbling something in return, and pulls out her picture. He dreams: she is back on the swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher![now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over. Cut to her opening a little box] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! [in the cockpit, she calls out] It's all for you! [an alarm sounds, and the gas tank explodes behind her] Aaaaaaa! [she tries to land the plane right, but it falls into a swimming pool. She's thrown clear, into the water] Richard!"
1060,3,5,Clyde Donovan,Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
1061,3,5,Mr Adler,"[returns] Huh? Uh, what?"
1062,3,5,Clyde Donovan,Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander [Tommy comes and stands beside Clyde. There are no features on his face.]
1063,3,5,Mr Adler,"The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I? [Clyde looks at Tommy for a reaction, but...] Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. [Tommy walks away in the wrong direction]"
1064,3,5,Clyde Donovan,[noticing the picture and points] What's that?
1065,3,5,Mr Adler,"Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago."
1066,3,5,Clyde Donovan,What? She die or something?
1067,3,5,Mr Adler,"What? Hey! Go on! [upset, he puts the picture away] You're screwing around in here! [Clyde hurries away]"
1068,3,5,Clyde Donovan,Oh boy! Here we go!
1069,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,[joins the group] What's happening?
1070,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
1071,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,Oh cool!
1072,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed. [the two groups meet] All right. Here we go."
1073,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy."
1074,3,5,Eric Cartman,"You're gonna be eating those words, asshole."
1075,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. [Craig and Tweek look at each other, but nothing happens]"
1076,3,5,Stan Marsh,Well?
1077,3,5,Eric Cartman,Come on!
1078,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!"
1079,3,5,Craig Tucker,[turns to the crowd] What do we do?
1080,3,5,Stan Marsh,Huh?
1081,3,5,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other."
1082,3,5,Tweek Tweak,How?
1083,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,How??
1084,3,5,Craig Tucker,I've never been in a fight before.
1085,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Me neither.
1086,3,5,Crowd,[let down] Awwww.
1087,3,5,Stan Marsh,"[in disgust] Aw, dude, come on!!"
1088,3,5,Eric Cartman,"You just hit each other, smack each other around. [Tweek slaps Craig, and Craig slaps Tweek. No effect]"
1089,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,[sighs] Not like that!
1090,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Like what, then?"
1091,3,5,Stan Marsh,"[approaches the fighters] All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight."
1092,3,5,Crowd,Awww. [disperses]
1093,3,5,Clyde Donovan,[to Wendy] All that build-up for nothing.
1094,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!"
1095,3,5,Stan Marsh,"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig."
1096,3,5,Eric Cartman,"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek."
1097,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!"
1098,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[faking fear] Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys! [serious] I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!"
1099,3,5,Stan Marsh,Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
1100,3,5,Eric Cartman,Fine! [the parties part ways]
1101,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Fine!
1102,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Fine, that's fine!"
1103,3,5,Jimbo,"Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing."
1104,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrrrh!
1105,3,5,Jimbo,You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
1106,3,5,Ned,Mmrr I can still kick ass.
1107,3,5,Jimbo,"Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you."
1108,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Hwaaah! [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]
1109,3,5,Jimbo,"Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. [rings the bell, and Ned sends Tweek to the ropes with one punch]"
1110,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Uugh!
1111,3,5,Ned,"Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch? [Tweek gets up]"
1112,3,5,Jimbo,"Keep your guard up, Tweek! [Tweek does so. Ned punches him twice more, and Tweek falls]"
1113,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Ow!
1114,3,5,Stan Marsh,Damn it!
1115,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!"
1116,3,5,Jimbo,"All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. [Tweek gets up]"
1117,3,5,Ned,"[prancing] Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch?"
1118,3,5,Jimbo,"Punch him in the balls, Tweek!! [Tweek lunges at Ned and lands the punch]"
1119,3,5,Ned,AAAAaaaarrgh.
1120,3,5,Jimbo,"Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! [Tweek lands a barrage of punches, and Ned groans after each punch]"
1121,3,5,Ned,Ow.
1122,3,5,Jimbo,"Good! Now kick his balls! [Tweek does so several times, and Ned groans] There, see? You've got him coughing up blood."
1123,3,5,Stan Marsh,Hooray!
1124,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Hooray!
1125,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrrr!
1126,3,5,Jimbo,Now THAT'S BOXING!
1127,3,5,Master,"Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect. [Craig flips him off] In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf."
1128,3,5,Craig Tucker,Meatloaf?
1129,3,5,Master,The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
1130,3,5,Eric Cartman,"I'm ready! [comes out, speaks softly] Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. [stops to pull some salt out of a kettle and pats his hands together]"
1131,3,5,Master,"Let us begin. [Cartman plants his feet] Ready? And, th-ree."
1132,3,5,Eric Cartman,Respect my authoritah! [he and Craig engage in pushing each other]
1133,3,5,Master,Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
1134,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[turns around to back Craig out of the ring] Dude. Come on, now. Come on."
1135,3,5,Craig Tucker,"Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!"
1136,3,5,Master,Fight back! Resist the ass!
1137,3,5,Craig Tucker,How can I resist an ass so great?
1138,3,5,Master,It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.
1139,3,5,Craig Tucker,"This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. [Cartman bumps him off the ring, he hits a wall, and he's out]"
1140,3,5,Eric Cartman,I win!
1141,3,5,Master,"There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession."
1142,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey, maybe. [plants his feet again]"
1143,3,5,Mr Adler,[twisting and turning] No. No. Make it stop.
1144,3,5,Fianc e,"[laughing on the yard outside] Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot! [in the cockpit during flight] Watch me, Richard! [waves to him as she writes ""I love U Richard."" As she gets to the last letters, she loses control and the alarm comes on. Her gas tank explodes and she screams. She manages to write A's on her way down to a crash in the pool. She sinks and calls out] Richard!"
1145,3,5,Mr Adler,"Baaaaa! [looks around and then sobs] I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye! [reaches for some nicotine gum, only to find the box empty] Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! [begins bawling]"
1146,3,5,Pearl,"Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together. [holds up a board saying] Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"
1147,3,5,Class,"[including Kenny] Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"
1148,3,5,Pearl,"All right, now let's try this one together. [holds up a board saying] Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car...."
1149,3,5,Class,[including Kenny] Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
1150,3,5,Pearl,"Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one. [holds up a board saying] I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life."
1151,3,5,Bebe Stevens,I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
1152,3,5,Pearl,"Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try? [holds up a board saying] I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed."
1153,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
1154,3,5,Pearl,"[looks at him in dismay] O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick?"
1155,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Sure you can.) [gets up and goes to her desk]
1156,3,5,Pearl,"Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you."
1157,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Why?)
1158,3,5,Pearl,"Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good."
1159,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(You don't?)
1160,3,5,Pearl,No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.
1161,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Shop class?) [images of threatening tools tools fill his head: a drill, a torch, a belt sander, a table saw] (No, I won't!)"
1162,3,5,Pearl,"Now, now. Very few students are severely injured in a shop class."
1163,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(I don't wanna take shop class!) [draws his hood tight, and the bell rings]"
1164,3,5,Bebe Stevens,Come on! It's time for the fight!
1165,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah! [the girls begin to file out of class]
1166,3,5,Pearl,"Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?"
1167,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Okay, the time has finally come. [the other kids close in]"
1168,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"[holding a box of] Programs, get your programs here. Programs."
1169,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low."
1170,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Hrrr.
1171,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek."
1172,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Rrrr, mean, rrrr."
1173,3,5,Eric Cartman,The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
1174,3,5,Craig Tucker,Okay.
1175,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!"
1176,3,5,Craig Tucker,"Okay, okay!"
1177,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrrr! [Craig adjusts his own head] Hr. [Craig flips him off]
1178,3,5,Stan Marsh,You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
1179,3,5,Craig Tucker,Respect my authority.
1180,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Tweek!"
1181,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Tweek!"
1182,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Craig!"
1183,3,5,Mr Adler,"Good-bye, cruel world. [sits up] Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! [lie back down, now head first]"
1184,3,5,Stan Marsh,Ye-hah!
1185,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! [the fighters, now tired and panting, butt heads]"
1186,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!"
1187,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Craig!"
1188,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
1189,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Get him! [the fighters just pant, stuck to each other] Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?"
1190,3,5,Tweek Tweak,What?
1191,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Craig just called you a boner!
1192,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrrr! [punches Craig]
1193,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,[to Stan:] We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
1194,3,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
1195,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Hi, Mr. Adler.)"
1196,3,5,Mr Adler,"What? Who are you? [takes the note and reads] ""Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class."" Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there. [hands him back the note and Kenny goes to the jigsaw] Hrh."
1197,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"[gets up] Huh? [Craig pops up and tackles Tweek. The other kids, fearing the fight over, cheer again.]"
1198,3,5,Mr Adler,[sits up] What the-? [the door opens and the other kids pour in]
1199,3,5,Stan Marsh,Here they are.
1200,3,5,Mr Adler,[stands and walks towards the kids] Hey! What's going on?
1201,3,5,Stan Marsh,Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. [trading punches]
1202,3,5,Mr Adler,"Well, why the hell don't you stop them?"
1203,3,5,Eric Cartman,'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
1204,3,5,Mr Adler,Don't screw aROUND![Craig and Tweek tumble towards Kenny]
1205,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Hey!) [They knock the stool out under him. He hangs on to the jigsaw table] (Hey!)
1206,3,5,Mr Adler,"Stop screwin' aROUND!![Tweek slams Craig into a second jigsaw and both tumble into a tool cart, which falls onto the second jigsaw, which tumbles onto the one Kenny is on.]"
1207,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, God damn it!)"
1208,3,5,Mr Adler,"Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!! [Kenny gets stuck in the blade and spins around. He's finally thrown clear and ends up in a box of old nails. Some nails fly out of the box.]"
1209,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Ugh!)
1210,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
1211,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
1212,3,5,Mr Adler,"[goes to the box of nails and plucks Kenny out] Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance! [the boys just shrug] You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?"
1213,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(I understand, dude.)"
1214,3,5,Mr Adler,"What? What's that, son?"
1215,3,5,Fianc e,[through Kenny] Richard.
1216,3,5,Mr Adler,"AAaaagh! [settles down] No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Stan shrugs]"
1217,3,5,Fianc e,"[visible now, where Kenny's face was] Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy."
1218,3,5,Mr Adler,But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
1219,3,5,Fianc e,"Then say it now, Richard."
1220,3,5,Mr Adler,Good-bye?
1221,3,5,Fianc e,There. Now do you feel better?
1222,3,5,Mr Adler,No.
1223,3,5,Fianc e,"Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it."
1224,3,5,Mr Adler,You... you're right. You're right. [The fiancée leaves and an old woman takes her place. The background is blue.]
1225,3,5,Woman,"Richard, this is Grandma."
1226,3,5,Mr Adler,"Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!"
1227,3,5,Gram ma,You never said good-bye to me either. [she leaves and a man enters]
1228,3,5,Man,"Hey, Richard. Remember me?"
1229,3,5,Mr Adler,"Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!"
1230,3,5,Mr. Adler's Uncle Corey,[gleefully] No! We're dead! [leaves]
1231,3,5,Fianc e,"[returns] I love you, Richard. See you soon."
1232,3,5,Mr Adler,"Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive. [holds Kenny close] Thank you, baby. Thank you."
1233,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
1234,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig."
1235,3,5,Nurse,"Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up. [leads the way. The kids follow and are let in. Craig and Tweek are in adjacent beds recovering from their injuries.]"
1236,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?"
1237,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrr!
1238,3,5,Craig Tucker,Ugh.
1239,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you."
1240,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. [Craig flips them off]"
1241,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad."
1242,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Boy, do we ever."
1243,3,5,Stan Marsh,"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. [the group turns towards the door]"
1244,3,5,Tweek Tweak,What?!
1245,3,5,Craig Tucker,What?!
1246,3,5,Stan Marsh,"[the group turns back to the beds] Well, I mean, that's what was on the news."
1247,3,5,Craig Tucker,What was on the news?
1248,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig."
1249,3,5,Craig Tucker,Huh?
1250,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters."
1251,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Uuh! You son of a bitch! [pounces on Craig, and the fighting starts again, leaving the room a mess]"
1252,3,5,Craig Tucker,I'm gonna kick your ass!
1253,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
1254,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!"
1255,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school."
1256,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,About what?
1257,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means? [Cartman raises his hand] Yes, Eric?"
1258,3,6,Eric Cartman,"When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind."
1259,3,6,Mr Garrison,"...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda. [Petey enters]"
1260,3,6,Petey,"[song and dance]

Sexual Harassment Panda

Hi, boys and girls. [the class says nothing]"
1261,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Say ""hi"" to Sexual Harassment Panda!"
1262,3,6,Class,"[hesitant] Hi, Sexual Harassment Panda."
1263,3,6,Clyde,Hababah...
1264,3,6,Petey,"[reaches behind the desk for a picture of two pandas in briefs] Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. [drops his head to one side]"
1265,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Stan] This is freaking me out, dude."
1266,3,6,Petey,"[shows another picture of two pandas...] And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda. [puts the picture away and gets some literature] Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law."
1267,3,6,Class,Awgh..!
1268,3,6,Petey,"""...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..."""
1269,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Ohh, dude, get me out of here!"
1270,3,6,Eric Cartman,I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
1271,3,6,Stan Marsh,"You would think that, you little ass-sucker."
1272,3,6,Eric Cartman,What did you call me?
1273,3,6,Stan Marsh,"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker."
1274,3,6,Eric Cartman,[indignant] That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
1275,3,6,Petey,Uh-oh.
1276,3,6,Stan Marsh,What?
1277,3,6,Eric Cartman,You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
1278,3,6,Petey,"That's right, he can."
1279,3,6,Stan Marsh,"No you can't, you little ass-sucker!"
1280,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!"
1281,3,6,Petey,"""The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda."""
1282,3,6,Judge Julie,"This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?"
1283,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second."
1284,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,[sitting by Stan] Dude! He got a lawyer?
1285,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,[entering] Sorry I'm late.
1286,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,Dad?!
1287,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh! Hi, Kyle. [moves to Cartman's side]"
1288,3,6,Judge Julie,"All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school."
1289,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Th... That is correct, my honor."
1290,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Hoh, whatever! [rests his head on his left hand]"
1291,3,6,Eric Cartman,He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
1292,3,6,Stan Marsh,I called you an ass-sucker!
1293,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset. [sniffs, Gerald comforts him] I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. [hides his face in Gerald's coat and begins sobbing]"
1294,3,6,Stan Marsh,"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!"
1295,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue."
1296,3,6,Judge Julie,"Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?"
1297,3,6,Stan Marsh,Wwhat do you mean?
1298,3,6,Judge Julie,I need to hear your defense.
1299,3,6,Stan Marsh,Uh... I'm eight?
1300,3,6,Judge Julie,"All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty."
1301,3,6,Stan Marsh,Huh?
1302,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"All right, we did it!"
1303,3,6,Eric Cartman,Hooray!
1304,3,6,Judge Julie,"Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately."
1305,3,6,Stan Marsh,I have to give him half my stuff?
1306,3,6,Eric Cartman,Sweet..!
1307,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game [on the cabinet next to the door. The collector puts it into Cartman's box], and that Power Jim doll. [goes to Stan's toy box] And, let's see... [pulls out a Mega Truck] Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?"
1308,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy."
1309,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, well, I'll just take that, then. [tosses it into his box and reaches for a lizard] And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?"
1310,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Uh, no! I hate that toy!"
1311,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! [tosses it into his box]"
1312,3,6,Stan Marsh,Damnit!
1313,3,6,Collector,[approaches Gerald with two toys] Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football.
1314,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Hm. [drops them and walks to Cartman] You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh..."
1315,3,6,Eric Cartman,Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
1316,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools. [Cartman looks through Stan's drawers] Perhaps we should sue them next."
1317,3,6,Eric Cartman,"What? But uh, why should I sue the school?"
1318,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings."
1319,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Interesting. [the collector picks up a can and presses a button on it] Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. [rushes to grab it]"
1320,3,6,Judge Julie,Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
1321,3,6,Mr Garrison,"No, I had no freakin' idea!"
1322,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?"
1323,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!"
1324,3,6,Judge Julie,"You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat."
1325,3,6,Mr Garrison,"I'm sorry, toots."
1326,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?"
1327,3,6,Mr Garrison,Yes.
1328,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,And you did nothing.
1329,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Well, he is a little ass-sucker. [the audience laughs]"
1330,3,6,Judge Julie,"[gaveling twice] Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!"
1331,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Okay, baby, I'm sorry."
1332,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?"
1333,3,6,Principal Victoria,"Well, not any more than any other student."
1334,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
1335,3,6,Principal Victoria,I don't know!
1336,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,You don't know?! You're the principal!
1337,3,6,Principal Victoria,I can't be around every second!
1338,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,[staring her down] So it DOES go on!!!
1339,3,6,Principal Victoria,"All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!! [beaks down on the stand] OH GOD!!!"
1340,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?"
1341,3,6,Principal Victoria,"[composes herself] I believe so, yes. [the audience begins to murmur]"
1342,3,6,Man,That's sexual harassment.
1343,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda."
1344,3,6,Petey,"[song and dance as he goes to the stand]
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda"
1345,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?"
1346,3,6,Petey,"Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment."
1347,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,And who's to blame?
1348,3,6,Petey,I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible.
1349,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
1350,3,6,Petey,Panda.
1351,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,Pan-Panda's mouth.
1352,3,6,Judge Julie,"After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages."
1353,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"All right! We did it, Eric!"
1354,3,6,Eric Cartman,"[takes his jacket off and twirls it around]
It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah"
1355,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"That goes in the master bedroom. [Kyle walks up] Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?"
1356,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's... big.
1357,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big."
1358,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?"
1359,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million."
1360,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,[thinks a bit] And you don't see a problem with that?
1361,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
1362,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?"
1363,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Sort of, yeah."
1364,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions? [Stan raises his hand. The desks, pictures, and numbers are gone] Yes, Stan?"
1365,3,6,Stan Marsh,Where's our desks?
1366,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits."
1367,3,6,Stan Marsh,"[huffs] You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?"
1368,3,6,Eric Cartman,"All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!"
1369,3,6,Clyde,Wow! I wanna sue somebody! [smiles at Bebe]
1370,3,6,Bebe,"Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer."
1371,3,6,Class,Yeah!
1372,3,6,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
1373,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. [starts writing, with a nail. The sound just grates to the ear]"
1374,3,6,Class,[wincing] AAGGGHHH!!
1375,3,6,Mr Garrison,"[turns to face the class] I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, ""The ball is red..."" [loud scratching]"
1376,3,6,Class,[wincing] AAGGGGHHH!!
1377,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[turns around] Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you [slams his briefcase shut] close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!"
1378,3,6,Bebe,"[outside] After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! [rings her bell and rides away]"
1379,3,6,Clyde,"[on a yacht, The Litigator, sunning himself] Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! [four of them come to cater to him]"
1380,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! [jumps for joy. This shot is frozen as the jingle is sung]"
1381,3,6,Singers,"Kids picking on you? Well, don't be sad
Just sue their asses with Kyle's dad
[""Call now! 1-555-SUE THEM""]"
1382,3,6,Chairman,"All right, what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget?"
1383,3,6,Woman,"Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools."
1384,3,6,Chairman,"Oh, right. We certainly can't afford him anymore."
1385,3,6,Woman,"I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously."
1386,3,6,Petey,"[enters]
Hello, sexual harassment cubs.
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda"
1387,3,6,Mr Evans,"Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris."
1388,3,6,Petey,Who?
1389,3,6,Mr Evans,Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda.
1390,3,6,Petey,"Oh, all right. [sits]"
1391,3,6,Mr Evans,"Uh—M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a ""panda"" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children. [Petey's head tilts]"
1392,3,6,Woman,"You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment. [long pause] At all."
1393,3,6,Mr Evans,...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go.
1394,3,6,Petey,[rubs his eyes] I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.
1395,3,6,Judge Julie,"Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school."
1396,3,6,Eric Cartman,No way!
1397,3,6,Pip,I won!
1398,3,6,Eric Cartman,This is ridiculous!
1399,3,6,Judge Julie,"You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million."
1400,3,6,Principal Victoria,"[Mr. Mackey sits with her] Oh, dear God!"
1401,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Wow, I'm good!"
1402,3,6,Judge Julie,Next!
1403,3,6,Craig,This girl touched my thigh.
1404,3,6,Judge Julie,"Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million."
1405,3,6,Principal Victoria,We're ruined!
1406,3,6,Judge Julie,Next!
1407,3,6,Mr Mackey,"Uh, Your Honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass."
1408,3,6,Tweek,[hops] Guh!
1409,3,6,Judge Julie,"Half his stuff, 2 million from the school."
1410,3,6,Principal Victoria,Oh..! [faints right off the chair]
1411,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today. [gets out the rusty nail, but turns to see the class with Mr. Broflovski in the back] Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?"
1412,3,6,Clyde,Um...
1413,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,[admonishing] Don't answer that!
1414,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Uh, Craig, how about you?"
1415,3,6,Craig,Um... [Gerald whispers in his ear] Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
1416,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,[whispers] Incriminate.
1417,3,6,Craig,Incriminate.
1418,3,6,Mr Garrison,"[angrily] Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time! [Gerald approaches and whispers in his ear] Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight. [Gerald leaves] Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum..."
1419,3,6,Kevin McCarty,[to Red] Let's trade sandwiches.
1420,3,6,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
1421,3,6,Boys,"Hey, Chef."
1422,3,6,Chef,How's it going?
1423,3,6,Stan Marsh,Bad.
1424,3,6,Chef,"Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes."
1425,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!"
1426,3,6,Chef,"Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut."
1427,3,6,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
1428,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?"
1429,3,6,Chef,"I don't know, children. [to Kyle] Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?"
1430,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money."
1431,3,6,Chef,"Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge."
1432,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, what about that stupid panda?"
1433,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!"
1434,3,6,Chef,"Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out."
1435,3,6,Eric Cartman,Noooo! [runs out]
1436,3,6,Mr Evans,That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours.
1437,3,6,Woman,Oh my God!
1438,3,6,Mr Evans,Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs.
1439,3,6,Woman,The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
1440,3,6,Mr Evans,"Holy smokes, you're right!"
1441,3,6,Stan Marsh,"[enter with Kyle, Cartman, Kenny] 'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please."
1442,3,6,Mr Evans,Ugh! [he and the other members hide behind their chairs] P-please! Don't sue us.
1443,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,[confused] Huh?
1444,3,6,Man,We'll give you anything you want.
1445,3,6,Stan Marsh,We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
1446,3,6,Mr Evans,"Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go."
1447,3,6,Eric Cartman,What?!
1448,3,6,Mr Evans,"[ducks and rises again] D'uh. I mean, he left."
1449,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Well, where is he?!"
1450,3,6,Woman,"We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!"
1451,3,6,Stan Marsh,What the hell is wrong with these people?!
1452,3,6,Company rep,"Well. Uh, your credentials are very impressive, and you do seem to have a lot of ambition, uh but I'm afraid there's no room for you at our company at this time."
1453,3,6,Petey,"It's because I'm a panda, isn't it?"
1454,3,6,Company rep,"Well, i-it is because you're a panda. Euh, it's because you're a sexual harassment panda."
1455,3,6,Petey,I can't help what I am.
1456,3,6,Company rep,"Now, have you ever heard of a retreat called ""The Island of Misfit Mascots""?"
1457,3,6,Petey,"Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense."
1458,3,6,Company rep,"Well, uh, yes. They may be... just what you're looking for."
1459,3,6,Petey,I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?!
1460,3,6,Reporter,"As sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state, the mother of all trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, the lawyer from South Park who plans to make quite a commission. Representing the side of Everyone Else is Gerald Broflovski. So whatever the outcome, things look very bright for Kyle's dad. Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just a whore, taking advantage of everyone in town and... [a note is handed to him] This just in! Newscaster Kevin McCarty is being sued by Kyle's dad for slander. The newscaster has yet to be reached for comment. Wait..."
1461,3,6,Jukebox,"Some days just seem lonely
Still, there don't seem to be no end in sight..."
1462,3,6,Barkeep,"Another scotch? [Petey nods affirmatively, and the barkeep serves up another scotch. Petey sips]"
1463,3,6,Jukebox,So I'll drive this ol' 18-wheeler down the highway...
1464,3,6,Standing Patron,Hey! Panda bear! [Petey lowers his drink to look at him] We don't take kindly to your types in here.
1465,3,6,Barkeep,"Now, calm down, Skeeter. He ain't hurtin' nobody."
1466,3,6,Skeeter and Bar Patrons,"No! [approaches Petey] I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?! [Petey has no answer]"
1467,3,6,Barkeep,"Sk-heeter, I don't want no trouble nu-how."
1468,3,6,Petey,"It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots! [rises and goes out the door. Skeeter watches him go]"
1469,3,6,Barkeep,"Damnit, Skeeter! How come every time a panda bear come in here you gotta go flappin' your jaw?"
1470,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[Kyle arrives] Well? What do you think, Kyle?"
1471,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
1472,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, this one is bigger!"
1473,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!"
1474,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[kneels] Kyle, let me explain something to you."
1475,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[annoyed, looks askance] Hoh God, here we go."
1476,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace."
1477,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,Isn't that fascism?
1478,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?"
1479,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,Do you?
1480,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[rises] Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it."
1481,3,6,Stan Marsh,[enters] 'Scuse me.
1482,3,6,Barkeep,Yeah? What can I do for you?
1483,3,6,Stan Marsh,Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
1484,3,6,Barkeep,"Big panda bear, big panda bear, hm..."
1485,3,6,Skeeter and Bar Patrons,Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
1486,3,6,Barkeep,"Now, calm down, Skeeter. They ain't hurtin' nobody."
1487,3,6,Skeeter and Bar Patrons,No! [approaches Stan] I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!
1488,3,6,Stan Marsh,...Coats?
1489,3,6,Barkeep,"Now, Skeeter, I don't want no trouble."
1490,3,6,Patron with hat,[pointing at Stan] We don't take kindly to your types around here!
1491,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell is going in?!"
1492,3,6,Eric Cartman,"Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?"
1493,3,6,Skeeter and Bar Patrons,[pounds the counter] We don't take kindly to panda bears!
1494,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Well, we don't take kindly to you!"
1495,3,6,Patron with hat,"[pointing at Stan] Well, we don't take kindly to folks that don't take kindly around here. [they look anew at each other, and nothing more is said among them]"
1496,3,6,Barkeep,"Kids, there was a panda bear in here. He said somethin' about the Island of Misfit Mascots."
1497,3,6,Eric Cartman,Where's that?
1498,3,6,Barkeep,"If I'm not mistaken, it's over near the Jenkins' place."
1499,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we'd better hurry. [the boys make their way past the men and leave]"
1500,3,6,Skeeter and Bar Patrons,Whoa! Lookie her! [a blonde sits alone at the bar] Hey! Beautiful woman! [she sips a beer and lowers the bottle] We don't take kindly to your types around here!
1501,3,6,Barkeep,"Nu-how, Skeeter. She ain't hurtin' nobody."
1502,3,6,Judge Julie,"This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone. [gavels, and all fall quiet] Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski."
1503,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated."
1504,3,6,Stan Marsh,"[reads] ""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune"". This must be the place. [they enter]"
1505,3,6,Worm,"Hello there, boys."
1506,3,6,Stan Marsh,Whoa! Who are you?
1507,3,6,Worm,"I'm Willy, the ""Don't Stare Directly Into The Sun"" Worm. Now, you boys know not to stare directly into the sun, right?"
1508,3,6,Boys,Yes.
1509,3,6,Willy,"That can burn your retinas and make you blind. [pulls out some shades and a cane, puts on the shades, and sticks the cane out, to simulate a blind person, then puts his props away]"
1510,3,6,Stan Marsh,"...Thanks a lot, dude."
1511,3,6,Pig,"[rushes up snapping two pairs of scissors around] Oink oink! Be sure to run around with scissors, says Oinky, the ""Run Around With Scissors"" Pig."
1512,3,6,Eric Cartman,I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
1513,3,6,Willy,That's why he's on the Island Of Misfit Mascots. [Oinky walks away]
1514,3,6,Stan Marsh,Have you seen any panda bears?
1515,3,6,Willy,Hm...
1516,3,6,Falcon,"[shows up behind the boys] Hey, kids! I'm Jimmy, the ""Don't Hold On To A Large Magnet While Someone Else Uses A Fan Nearby"" Falcon!"
1517,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,What??
1518,3,6,Jimmy,"Here, watch. [hands a large magnet to Kenny, then walks to a wind-generating fan and turns it on. As the blades rev up, the magnet tugs at Kenny]"
1519,3,6,Kenny McCormick,"(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!) [the magnet pulls him into the blades, and he's chopped up into bits] (Argh--!)"
1520,3,6,Jimmy,See?
1521,3,6,Stan Marsh,Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
1522,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You bastards! [looks further on] Hey! There he is! [Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda, seated on a bench while a whale and an octopus dance to his song]"
1523,3,6,Petey,"Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
[the boys rush up, and the whale and octopus leave]"
1524,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!"
1525,3,6,Petey,Why?
1526,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!"
1527,3,6,Petey,Seems all I do now is cause trouble.
1528,3,6,Badger,"Hello, kidsh, I'm Happy, the ""Don't Do Stuff That Might Irritate Your Inner Ear"" Badger. [a long silence follows as the boys look at Happy] Well, I'll leave now."
1529,3,6,Stan Marsh,"Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other."
1530,3,6,Petey,"But, I'm just a panda."
1531,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! [All mascots within hearing distance turn to see the cause of this outburst]"
1532,3,6,Willy,"[rushes over to Petey and the boys] Heeyy, I'm a real worm, pal!!"
1533,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, sorry, sorry."
1534,3,6,Eric Cartman,"You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool."
1535,3,6,Stan Marsh,"[to Petey] Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again."
1536,3,6,Petey,What message?
1537,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
1538,3,6,Petey,...You know? You little cubs might just be right.
1539,3,6,Willy,Yeah!
1540,3,6,Petey,[jumps up and stands] Okay!
1541,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments."
1542,3,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[bursting in] Wait! [Stan, Cartman, and Petey follow]"
1543,3,6,Mr Garrison,"Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda."
1544,3,6,Stan Marsh,"[faces the audience] No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say."
1545,3,6,Petey,"Hello, everyone. I'm Petey, the ""Don't Sue People"" Panda."
1546,3,6,Jimbo,"""Don't Sue People"" Panda? [the bar patrons are present]"
1547,3,6,Skeeter and Bar Patrons,[stands up] Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!
1548,3,6,Barkeep,"Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody."
1549,3,6,Petey,"Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you. [The courtroom is silent, listening] There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. [reactions are seen in the faces of various people in the courtroom, even in Gerald's face.]"
1550,3,6,Bearded man,"I'm a sad panda, too."
1551,3,6,Man 1,I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault! [people get angry at Gerald]
1552,3,6,Man 2,[rises] Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!
1553,3,6,All,[rising] Yeah!
1554,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[approaches Petey and the boys] No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!"
1555,3,6,Petey,"""Don't Sue People"" Panda."
1556,3,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!"
1557,3,6,Petey Boys,Hooray!
1558,3,6,Petey,"Pandas love ice cream. [Gerald, Petey, and the boys leave the courtroom]"
1559,3,6,Judge Julie,"Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed! [gavels and leaves the bench]"
1560,3,6,Skeeter and Bar Patrons,[people in the audience leave] Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
1561,3,6,Barkeep,"[passing by] God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up."
1562,3,6,Petey,"Hello, cubs. I'm ""Don't Sue People"" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now. [walks off]"
1563,3,7,"""Arliss Loveless"" Rumpertumskin",[as Loveless] Heheheheh! Now I will kill the President and Salma Hayek!

1573,3,7,Liane Cartman,"I have to leave soon, Eric."
1574,3,7,Eric Cartman,"But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek."

1577,3,7,Liane Cartman,"Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly."
1578,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Okay.
1579,3,7,Liane Cartman,All those other babysitters won't come back.
1580,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time."
1581,3,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears."
1582,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Bears?
1583,3,7,Liane Cartman,Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
1584,3,7,Mr. Kitty,Meowrowr!
1585,3,7,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty! I don't have anything!"
1586,3,7,Mr. Kitty,[starts rubbing her ass against the sofa] Meow rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
1587,3,7,Eric Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!"
1588,3,7,Mr. Kitty,[looks at him with her ass up in the air] Rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
1589,3,7,Eric Cartman,"No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty! [Kitty runs away]"
1590,3,7,Liane Cartman,"[enters with Shelly] Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?"
1591,3,7,Eric Cartman,[absently] Uh-huh.
1592,3,7,Liane Cartman,Be good.
1593,3,7,Eric Cartman,[huffs] Right.
1594,3,7,Liane Cartman,Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses! [kneels next to Cartman]
1595,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw, Ma."
1596,3,7,Liane Cartman,Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!
1597,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[mad] Jesus Christ. [drops to the floor, and they rub noses]"
1598,3,7,Liane Cartman,"Bye, kids. [gets up and leaves the house]"
1599,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[now approaches Shelly] Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry! [she punches him into the wall, which leaves an impact site with paint fallen off] Ow!"
1600,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!"
1601,3,7,Eric Cartman,"You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? [she punches him, sending him into the wall again]"
1602,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!"
1603,3,7,Eric Cartman,You're not allowed to have people over!
1604,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"[takes the remote] Move! [points towards the kitchen, and Cartman eventually rises and goes there]"
1605,3,7,Eric Cartman,"This is bullcrap! [strains to open the freezer, but fails] I can't reach the freezer!"
1606,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"[from the living room] Figure it out, turd!"
1607,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[huffs] God dammit! [goes for a chair and props it up in front of the refrigerator. As he hops onto the chair, Kitty walks in still pining] Shut up, Kitty! [turns and sees the note on the freezer door, then grabs it and reads it] Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha! [hops off the chair, moves it back to the table, and sits on it. He grabs a telephone] I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! [he picks up the receiver, only to find a familiar voice on the line]"
1608,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"...So I said, ""you're a little turd!"" and he w-"
1609,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[hangs up] Dammit! [waits for a moment, then picks up the receiver again. Kitty now pines on the stove]"
1610,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all. [hangs up, waits, then picks up again] ...stupid turd! The one night-"
1611,3,7,Eric Cartman,Ey! I need to use the phone!
1612,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie. [enters the kitchen and pulls Cartman's underwear over his back and head, blinding him]"
1613,3,7,Eric Cartman,Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! [she leaves and he picks up the receiver again]
1614,3,7,Shelly Marsh,I placed his underwear over his head.
1615,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[hangs up and puts his underwear back in place. Kitty resumes meowing] I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!! [her meows are persistent] SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! [Kitty screeches and dashes out of the kitchen]"
1616,3,7,Announcer,"And now, back to the movie of the week, Aliens."
1617,3,7,Newt,"[to Ripley] They mostly come at night, mostly."
1618,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[echoing Newt] They mostly come at night, mostly. [Shelly comes in and tosses Cartman off the sofa, then changes the channel to Friends. Cartman returns to the sofa] Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!"
1619,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Well, I'm watching Friends, turd! [the doorbell rings] That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. [Cartman answers the door and looks at a young man in baseball cap and leather jacket]"
1620,3,7,Dude,"Hey there, is Shelly around?"
1621,3,7,Eric Cartman,Who the hell are you?
1622,3,7,Dude,I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot up your ass if you don't tell me where Shelly is!
1623,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"[appears at the door] Hey, Skyler."
1624,3,7,Eric Cartman,You know this guy?
1625,3,7,Shelly Marsh,He's my boyfriend! [Cartman studies him]
1626,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Christ, he's like 50 years old!"
1627,3,7,Shelly Marsh,He's 22! [Cartman studies him some more]
1628,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that's not cool."
1629,3,7,Shelly Marsh,You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
1630,3,7,Skyler,Ye Yeah-ha.
1631,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly. [Skyler enters and pulls Cartman's underwear over Cartman's head. Shelly grins and Skyler drops him.] Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit!"
1632,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments [giggles and takes his hand. They walk to the kitchen. As they pass the sofa, Kitty is looking at TV]"
1633,3,7,Announcer,"And now, back to Wild Animal World"
1634,3,7,Host,"[a lion follows a lioness around] Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season. [Kitty watches intently as the lion overtakes the lioness. The lioness lays down] The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls. [Kitty meows loudly with excitement as the lion does his stuff] The female lion relaxes her body and says ""hello"" to Mr. Winky. [Kitty continues meowing. The lioness rolls over on her back] The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside. [The lion moves away] Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed. [lion and lioness relax as the sun sets. Kitty is almost beside herself, rubbing her ass against the rug]"
1635,3,7,Skyler,Mmmmm. [tries to kiss her]
1636,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"No, Skyler. Quit it."
1637,3,7,Skyler,"Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?"
1638,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Eight days tomorrow.
1639,3,7,Skyler,And I still don't get any action.
1640,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all."
1641,3,7,Skyler,But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
1642,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Well, maybe just one kiss."
1643,3,7,Skyler,"Mmmmm [kisses her on the lips, but Cartman intrudes]"
1644,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, what are you doing? [Skyler pulls back quick]"
1645,3,7,Skyler,"Beat it, chubby!"
1646,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Go on, Astroturd!"
1647,3,7,Skyler,Mmmmm [a tongue-kiss]
1648,3,7,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
1649,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Turd Rock From the Sun!
1650,3,7,Eric Cartman,Ey! You ate all the pizza!
1651,3,7,Shelly Marsh,We left you some crusts! [tosses some to him]
1652,3,7,Eric Cartman,"That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! [she snatches the note from him and sends him into the wall with one jab]"
1653,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Guess again, Richard the Turd!"
1654,3,7,Eric Cartman,Give me that phone number!
1655,3,7,Skyler,"Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room. [they leave]"
1656,3,7,Eric Cartman,[rises] I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick! [thinks for a moment] Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
1657,3,7,Mr. Kitty,[walks in] Meow.
1658,3,7,Eric Cartman,"God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. [goes to the sink, opens the doors, and starts looking]"
1659,3,7,Mr. Kitty,Meow.
1660,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. [pulls out a box of Playful Pussy Catnip and pours some onto the floor in front of Kitty]"
1661,3,7,Mr. Kitty,"Meowrowrowrowrowrowrowrowr. [still longing for consummation, she jumps all over the kitchen knocking things over]"
1662,3,7,Skyler,"Red Rocket spills my icy soul.
Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!"
1663,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"You're such an amazing poet, Skyler."
1664,3,7,Skyler,"[putting the guitar aside] Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it. [reaches over to kiss Shelly]"
1665,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"[holding him off] Skyler, not here."
1666,3,7,Skyler,I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them. [draws her close]
1667,3,7,Shelly Marsh,[giggles] Really?
1668,3,7,Skyler,"I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar."
1669,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Wow!
1670,3,7,Skyler,"When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff."
1671,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"O Skyler, I love you. [their lips lock]"
1672,3,7,Skyler,Mmmmm. [A flash bulb goes off and Shelly stands up on the sofa]
1673,3,7,Shelly Marsh,What the-?
1674,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[with Polaroid camera in hand and a fresh picture] Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!"
1675,3,7,Shelly Marsh,[lunges after Cartman] Give me that picture!
1676,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Aaaaa! [runs away, and she gives chase. He runs up the stairs, but she catches up and grabs him by the foot halfway up the stairs. He kicks her off, then hurries to his room, closing the door on her as she reaches him] Yes!"
1677,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Open this door, Turdledove!"
1678,3,7,Eric Cartman,I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
1679,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. [Cartman is shocked at the possibility]
1680,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"[banging on Cartman's door] Give me that picture, turd!"
1681,3,7,Eric Cartman,You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
1682,3,7,Shelly Marsh,[in the hallway] I'm gonna bust this door down! [starts banging on the door again. Kitty is meowing]
1683,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[sees his toy frog on the bed and walks over] What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? [dons his cowboy hat]"
1684,3,7,"""Artemus"" Clyde Frog",[with his Wild Wild West shades on] We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
1685,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog. [doffs his hat and sees Kitty on his dresser rubbing her ass on the wall. He walks over] Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar. [the banging subsides] You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me. [walks to the window and sets Kitty on the sill] Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope! [Kitty jumps from the window to the garage roof, then from the roof to the trashcan, then to the ground] That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! [Kitty ends up at the front door]"
1686,3,7,Mr. Kitty,Meow. Meow. [the door opens and Shelly takes her in]
1687,3,7,Eric Cartman,Oh! God dammit!
1688,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Who is that?!
1689,3,7,Skyler,"Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice. [moves to answer the door]"
1690,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Skyler, your band can't practice here."
1691,3,7,Skyler,"Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe! [opens the door and the bandmates come in] 'Sup Mark? [carrying drums] 'Sup up. Jonesy? [carrying other drums]"
1692,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. [walks away]
1693,3,7,Eric Cartman,Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
1694,3,7,Shelly Marsh,[faking concern] Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
1695,3,7,Eric Cartman,[wary] You just want me to open the door!
1696,3,7,Shelly Marsh,We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
1697,3,7,Eric Cartman,What?? Ih- is she okay?
1698,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Not really. She's dead.
1699,3,7,Eric Cartman,Huh?! [quickly opens the door]
1700,3,7,Shelly Marsh,[enters] Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
1701,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!"
1702,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!"
1703,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!"
1704,3,7,Shelly Marsh,[walks to a dresser] You mean this one? [hold out the letter she finds]
1705,3,7,Eric Cartman,"O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, dammit! [he turns away defeated, and she gives him another wedgie over the head] AAAAH! [she pulls him downstairs by his underpants and enters the living room. Cartman groans at every step he hits]"
1706,3,7,Skyler,"Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. [points at her and winks. She sits on the sofa, happy]
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly.
[she dances in place on the sofa]"
1707,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw, man, you guys suck."
1708,3,7,Skyler,"Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly."
1709,3,7,Eric Cartman,You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
1710,3,7,Skyler,"Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly"
1711,3,7,Mr. Kitty,"Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow."
1712,3,7,A cat,[from a red house nearby] Meow. [Kitty looks to see where the meow coming from] Meow.
1713,3,7,Mr. Kitty,[urgently] Meow?
1714,3,7,A cat,"Meow. [Kitty looks to make sure there's no one around, then jumps onto a car parked on the driveway and runs away. A red van is parked on the street]"
1715,3,7,Skyler,"Bridge!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of Shelly
Shelly!"
1716,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[rocks back and forth on his hook, hands to ears] Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head!"
1717,3,7,Skyler,"Ey, shut up, tubby!"
1718,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh! [Shelly walks to the coatrack] You get out now and respect my authoritah! [she pulls Cartman down a bit so the coatrack can act like a slingshot. She lets go and Cartman hits the ceiling] Ow! [lands on his feet as Shelly turns to walk away. She stops to watch the band and he picks her pocket to get his mom's note.]"
1719,3,7,Mr. Kitty,Meow?
1720,3,7,A cat,Meow.
1721,3,7,Mr. Kitty,Meow?
1722,3,7,A cat,"Meow. [Kitty is near the source, but keeps looking]"
1723,3,7,Mr. Kitty,Meow? [enters a small passageway between two buildings]
1724,3,7,A cat,Meow.
1725,3,7,Mr. Kitty,Meow?
1726,3,7,A cat,Meow. Meow. Meow. [an obese orange cat on his back rolls over and inches over to Kitty. Kitty looks at the camera]
1727,3,7,Skyler,"Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?"
1728,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
1729,3,7,Mark,"Oh, really?!"
1730,3,7,Shelly Marsh,I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
1731,3,7,Jonesy,"Oh, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch!"
1732,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Well, I do have a song I wrote."
1733,3,7,Skyler,"O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?"
1734,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!"
1735,3,7,Skyler,"Hey man, don't be shy."
1736,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Uhwwell, okay. [hops off the sofa] I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. [Skyler moves to the keyboard as Shelly hands out her music and takes the mic]
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever."
1737,3,7,Skyler,Don't you know? Isn't...
1738,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!"
1739,3,7,Eric Cartman,Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
1740,3,7,Liane Cartman,"No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors."
1741,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, there's a whole crappy band here! [""TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!""] Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? [directs the receiver towards the music]"
1742,3,7,Liane Cartman,"This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up."
1743,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[""TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin'...""] Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!"
1744,3,7,Liane Cartman,"Not really, hon. [Mr. Mackey appears behind her] Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour! [Cartman just looks at the receiver] Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!"
1745,3,7,Mr Mackey,"Mhm, mkay? [upset, Cartman hangs up]"
1746,3,7,Eric Cartman,I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here! [looks at his Mr. Microphone-type radio] My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
1747,3,7,Shelly Marsh,In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
1748,3,7,Mark,"[tiring of the song] Dude, this is gay!"
1749,3,7,Skyler,Shut up! [Shelly stares at Mark]
1750,3,7,Mark,You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
1751,3,7,Jonesy,"Yeah, dude. What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? She's like, 12."
1752,3,7,Skyler,"You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said! [his mates take their instruments and leave]"
1753,3,7,Mr. Kitty,"Rowr! [quickly shows her ass to the orange cat, waiting for his move. The orange cat pounces on her and smothers her] (Rowrowrowrowr!) [she squeezes her way out from under him]"
1754,3,7,Oragne cat,Rowr!
1755,3,7,Mr. Kitty,"Rowr. [this time, she rolls on her back. He jumps on her and smothers her again] Hrowr!"
1756,3,7,Oragne cat,Geuugh. [Kitty makes her way out again]
1757,3,7,Mr. Kitty,"[angrily] Meowr! [the obese cat simply collapses and sleeps] Meowuh! [seeing that the cat won't move, she leaves] Oh meah!"
1758,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[softly] Testing, testing, 1 2. [stops and rewinds, then plays the tape. The recording worked] Sweet. [Shelly enters and Cartman hides his radio]"
1759,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!"
1760,3,7,Eric Cartman,Okay. See you in a while.
1761,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Wha-?
1762,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly."
1763,3,7,Shelly Marsh,What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
1764,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, I just, I kind of like having you around."
1765,3,7,Shelly Marsh,What?! No you don't!
1766,3,7,Eric Cartman,"No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family. [Shelly's face softens] I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day."
1767,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us."
1768,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Yuh, you mean it?"
1769,3,7,Shelly Marsh,But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
1770,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Hooray! [Shelly exits, Cartman speaks softly] Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly."
1771,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[recording] Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now."
1772,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Shut up, turd!"
1773,3,7,Eric Cartman,"That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve."
1774,3,7,Shelly Marsh,What are you doing?
1775,3,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm just thinking out loud. [walks over to the bench and sits with his back to Skyler] Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?"
1776,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Go away, turd!"
1777,3,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler? [Skyler simply bumps him off the bench] Agh!"
1778,3,7,Mr. Kitty,"Meow [a bunch of other cats answer her call. They are all sitting by some steps. She walks over, sticks her ass in the air, and the other cats jump her]"
1779,3,7,Skyler,Yeah! Come on! Give it up!
1780,3,7,Shelly Marsh,No.
1781,3,7,Skyler,"Give it up, babe!"
1782,3,7,Shelly Marsh,NO!
1783,3,7,Skyler,"Come on, babih!"
1784,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"[pushes him off] No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!"
1785,3,7,Skyler,Why the hell not?!
1786,3,7,Shelly Marsh,'Cause I'm twelve! [Cartman moves up a bit]
1787,3,7,Skyler,You're not putting out for me?
1788,3,7,Shelly Marsh,No!
1789,3,7,Skyler,"Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!"
1790,3,7,Shelly Marsh,What?? But I thought you liked me.
1791,3,7,Skyler,"If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there! [she looks forsaken, Cartman draws closer] Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!"
1792,3,7,Eric Cartman,Gotcha! [Skyler drives away in the red van]
1793,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted! [Shelly continues crying] Hey! I said, guess who's busted! [Shelly doesn't seem to realize he's there] Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!"
1794,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"[between tears] I don't care. [cries some more, then pours out her emotions] He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before. [now Cartman softens] I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid."
1795,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?"
1796,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
1797,3,7,Eric Cartman,You're not ugly.
1798,3,7,Shelly Marsh,You don't think so?
1799,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?"
1800,3,7,Shelly Marsh,You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
1801,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know."
1802,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Huh?
1803,3,7,Eric Cartman,"If you want, I could help you."
1804,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Really? You would do that?
1805,3,7,Eric Cartman,Just let me get my cowboy hat.
1806,3,7,Mr. Kitty,Mreow? Mreow? Mreow! [the other cats come in and make themselves at home. Kitty turns on the stereo and music blares from the speakers. More cats come]
1807,3,7,Skyler,What the hell is this?!
1808,3,7,"""Salma Hayek"" Polly Prissy Pants","Help me! Help me! This is Salma Hayek. Is anybody there? [she lies next to the bear, which is playing the voices]"
1809,3,7,Skyler,"Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot. [goes into the woods to find her]"
1810,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[dressed as James West, reaches the open door] Okay, it's clear. [Stands watch as Shelly makes her way inside]"
1811,3,7,"""Salma Hayek"" Polly Prissy Pants","Over here! Please, come quick! [Skyler moves towards the voice]"
1812,3,7,Eric Cartman,We don't have much time!
1813,3,7,Shelly Marsh,This won't take me long!
1814,3,7,Eric Cartman,Hurry up in there!
1815,3,7,Shelly Marsh,I'm almost done.
1816,3,7,Skyler,"Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?"
1817,3,7,"""Salma Hayek"" Polly Prissy Pants",Over here! Please help me! I am lost and I have no clothes!
1818,3,7,Skyler,"[to himself] No clothes, right."
1819,3,7,"""Salma Hayek"" Polly Prissy Pants",I'm over here! Please help me! I will reward you greatly!
1820,3,7,Skyler,"Right here, Miss Hayek!"
1821,3,7,"""Salma Hayek"" Polly Prissy Pants","Oh, please help me!"
1822,3,7,Skyler,What the? [sees the Speak and Record bear and Polly Prissy Pants on the ground]
1823,3,7,"""Salma Hayek"" Polly Prissy Pants",Please help me! I will give you tacos!
1824,3,7,Skyler,"Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God dammit! [rushes home and enters] Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night! [gasps loudly. His guitar is in pieces and buried in kitty litter. Shards of wood are arranged to read ""King Turd"" in front of the neck of the guitar] My guitar! NOOOOO!"
1825,3,7,Eric Cartman,That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
1826,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"[faces him at the door] Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. [opens the door, and they both are shocked at what they see]"
1827,3,7,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! [the orgy is well under way]
1828,3,7,Shelly Marsh,They're having a cat orgy!
1829,3,7,Eric Cartman,"You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!"
1830,3,7,Shelly Marsh,Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
1831,3,7,Eric Cartman,"[gets the catnip and holds it up high] Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on. [points the way out, then goes towards the door. The cats follow] That's it. Come on, come on. [opens the door, only to find Skyler waiting for him] Uh oh."
1832,3,7,Skyler,"You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you! [Cartman throws the catnip at him and scores] Umph! [the cats jump on him] Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh! [horror and then glee appear on the faces of Cartman and Shelly] Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!"
1833,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home. [they go back inside and close the door] You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends."
1834,3,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I think we get along okay.
1835,3,7,Liane Cartman,"[enters] Hi, kids. I'm home."
1836,3,7,Eric Cartman,Heh. [all are afraid. Two cats hide behind Kitty] Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
1837,3,7,Shelly Marsh,No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
1838,3,7,Liane Cartman,"[holds on to the doorway] Oh, what a party that was! [walks towards the sofa] Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. [Crashes onto it and falls asleep]"
1839,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Wow, she passed out."
1840,3,7,Eric Cartman,"Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush."
1841,3,7,Shelly Marsh,"Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay."
1842,3,7,Eric Cartman,That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. [raps once more]
1843,3,8,Stan Marsh,I don't want to go to this stupid party!
1844,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time."
1845,3,8,Stan Marsh,"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels."
1846,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it."
1847,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm."
1848,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him."
1849,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement."
1850,3,8,Stan Marsh,Awww!
1851,3,8,Mr Mackey,"[leads the family across the room] Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita? [clap clap] Juanita? [clap clap] We need some more finger sandwiches? [she scurries by]"
1852,3,8,Stan Marsh,I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
1853,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time."
1854,3,8,Mr Mackey,"[opens a door] Here you go, it's right in here. [Stan enters and gasps. Before him are Pip, Butters, and Dougie.]"
1855,3,8,Randy Marsh,"We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan."
1856,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[soft but urgent, tugging at Randy's pants] Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!"
1857,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"You have fun, Stanley."
1858,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[soft but urgent, tugging at Sharon's dress] No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!"
1859,3,8,Mr Mackey,"We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts. [closes the door. Stan looks at it with hands in pockets, then he looks at the other kids. Pip, Butters, and Dougie smile at him. Stan tries to open the door, but it's locked. He turns to face his peers.]"
1860,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here."
1861,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Pip."
1862,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however."
1863,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Butters, is there any way out of here?"
1864,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room. [motions to the little boy to his left] Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think."
1865,3,8,Dougie,I like math.
1866,3,8,Stan Marsh,Oh my God.
1867,3,8,Pip Pirrup,We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
1868,3,8,Stan Marsh,No.
1869,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams [Butters bows] We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, ""Turrah!"" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar? [Stan just looks at them] And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
1870,3,8,All three,"Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. [Stan tries opening the door again]"
1871,3,8,Mr Garrison,"[quite drunk] Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass. [his right hand jerks to the right, pulling him] No! Mr. Hat, you get back here! [walks away. The Marshes and the Broflovskis stand in front of the punch bowl]"
1872,3,8,Mr Mackey,Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
1873,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol."
1874,3,8,Mr Mackey,[offers the drink] Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. [Sharon takes it]
1875,3,8,Randy Marsh,"One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little."
1876,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. [she takes a sip]"
1877,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, experiment."
1878,3,8,All three,"[dancing] Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
1879,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"[all turn 'round] Wickersham tally-ho ugh. [all fall on their backs. Pip gets up] Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?"
1880,3,8,Stan Marsh,[looks back] Yes.
1881,3,8,Dougie,What are you? A sourpuss?
1882,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice. [Pip walks off] Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh? [annoyed, Stan covers his ears] They got those thick noses and all."
1883,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"[looks in a box] Hey, look at this!"
1884,3,8,Butters Stotch,Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. [he and Dougie reach the box and look in]
1885,3,8,Pip Pirrup,[leafing around] It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.
1886,3,8,Dougie,[pulls out a padded bra and checks it out] Neato.
1887,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels."
1888,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[incredulous] Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me."
1889,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"[hopping] Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?"
1890,3,8,Butters Stotch,"No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it."
1891,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"[twirls with joy] Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed. [walks over to Stan] Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?"
1892,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!"
1893,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Well. [turns and walks away] Alrighty then.
1894,3,8,Mr Mackey,Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
1895,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Wow, neat!"
1896,3,8,Sheila Broflovski,It looks quite inviting.
1897,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub."
1898,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut."
1899,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Hell, we should get in."
1900,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah.
1901,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?"
1902,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear."
1903,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Hm huheh, that's okay. [giggles]"
1904,3,8,Sheila Broflovski,No hot tub for me!
1905,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, screw you guys! [disrobes and jumps in]"
1906,3,8,Randy Marsh,"I'm getting in for a while, too. [disrobes and jumps in] Geronimo!"
1907,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, look at our boys, Sheila. [Randy and Gerald splash each other] It's just like they're in college again."
1908,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?"
1909,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?"
1910,3,8,Dougie,How should I know?
1911,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission."
1912,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. [strokes his chin. All three look around, but the silence alerts Stan]"
1913,3,8,Stan Marsh,[looks back displeased] What?
1914,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?"
1915,3,8,Stan Marsh,[grudgingly] What do I have to do?
1916,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it."
1917,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast."
1918,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, that's a splendid mission!"
1919,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! [they go in different directions, but Dougie pauses]"
1920,3,8,Dougie,Which Angel am I again?
1921,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?"
1922,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
1923,3,8,Randy Marsh,"I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things."
1924,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar. [brushes it under his nose and sniffs it] Only 'cause I've never smoked before. [picks up a lighter and lights the cigar, then sets the lighter back]"
1925,3,8,Randy Marsh,Good idea.
1926,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
1927,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Hohn. [raises his elbows to the rim] Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me."
1928,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
1929,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Huh? Oh, you mean, this?"
1930,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah.
1931,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. That, that was me."
1932,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Bosley! Bosley!
1933,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[in no mood for role-playing] What, Pip?"
1934,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
1935,3,8,Stan Marsh,What the hell do you want?!
1936,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs."
1937,3,8,Stan Marsh,You did? [rises and walks to the way]
1938,3,8,Dougie,[dressed as Jill] Air shaft.
1939,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown."
1940,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"So Bosley, what's our next mission?"
1941,3,8,Stan Marsh,We're going upstairs.
1942,3,8,Butters Stotch,Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
1943,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! [crawls into the duct]"
1944,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot."
1945,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
1946,3,8,Randy Marsh,"O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that."
1947,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
1948,3,8,Randy Marsh,[eager to know] With two girls or two guys?
1949,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... [ends up staring at Randy]"
1950,3,8,Randy Marsh,"You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have."
1951,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,You haven't?
1952,3,8,Randy Marsh,"No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?"
1953,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy."
1954,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?"
1955,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"NO, no, uh I don't think so."
1956,3,8,Randy Marsh,...Well it is a night for experimenting.
1957,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Sure is. [both of them wait for the other to make the first move, then...]"
1958,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Okay, I'll start. [begins]"
1959,3,8,ATF lead,This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.
1960,3,8,ATF agent,[talks into a communicator] Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup. [the ATF lead looks at the house again]
1961,3,8,Officer Barbrady,"[immediate indeed, appears in the lead's sights] Okay, so just what is going on here, people?"
1962,3,8,ATF lead,Get down! [pulls him into position along with the others]
1963,3,8,Officer Barbrady,What?
1964,3,8,ATF lead,"It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. [resumes viewing, but is interrupted]"
1965,3,8,Officer Barbrady,Are you sure?
1966,3,8,ATF lead,"Of course we're sure! [points out the initials on his cap] We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do!"
1967,3,8,Officer Barbrady,So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
1968,3,8,ATF lead,"Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them."
1969,3,8,ATF lead,What's the situation?
1970,3,8,ATF agent,"[coming in from reconnaissance] Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts."
1971,3,8,ATF lead,Any luck talking to somebody in the house?
1972,3,8,ATF agent,"We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir."
1973,3,8,ATF lead,Alright. Johnson!
1974,3,8,Johnson,"[a marksman, runs up] Sir!"
1975,3,8,ATF lead,I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.
1976,3,8,Johnson,"Yes, sir! [makes his way to the front door while stopping at various points for better views. He rings the doorbell with his elbow, but doesn't wait for an answer]"
1977,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay? [Johnson, surprised, lowers his guard] Would you like a meteor mai tai?"
1978,3,8,Johnson,"Heeey, I love mai tais! [closes the door]"
1979,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"We did it! Great job, Angels!"
1980,3,8,Butters Stotch,"So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?"
1981,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[mischief flashing across his face] Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set."
1982,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?"
1983,3,8,Stan Marsh,"I don't care, just hurry! [the Angels walk away]"
1984,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Well, hooray!"
1985,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,[buttoning his jacket] So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
1986,3,8,Randy Marsh,[tying his shoes] ...Yeah.
1987,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?"
1988,3,8,Randy Marsh,"No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?"
1989,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
1990,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. [turns to go in]"
1991,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey. [Randy looks] Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends."
1992,3,8,Randy Marsh,Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. [goes inside]
1993,3,8,ATF lead,"Damn it, where is Johnson?!"
1994,3,8,ATF agent,"No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him."
1995,3,8,ATF lead,Those bastards!
1996,3,8,Man,"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much."
1997,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?"
1998,3,8,Woman,"We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again."
1999,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay? [waves them off and closes the door]"
2000,3,8,ATF lead,"[On a bullhorn] Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it! [the man shrugs] Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan!"
2001,3,8,Man,What?
2002,3,8,ATF lead,"Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot- [Shooting starts. The couple falls dead and the lead lowers the bullhorn] God damn it, who was that?! [most of the agents raise their hands] Did you see them move?!"
2003,3,8,Agent 1,...I did.
2004,3,8,Agent 2,[next to floodlight] Yah.
2005,3,8,Agent 3,"Yeah, they moved alright."
2006,3,8,Jimbo Kern,"Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year."
2007,3,8,Burly man,"Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?"
2008,3,8,Blond man,I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
2009,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?"
2010,3,8,Jimbo Kern,...What??
2011,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself."
2012,3,8,Burly man,Well... Let's go kick his ass!
2013,3,8,Other men,Yeah!
2014,3,8,Jimbo Kern,Where is he?!
2015,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida."
2016,3,8,Burly man,Aw! [the men disperse]
2017,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[walks up] Hey, Randy. What are you doing? [pats him on the back]"
2018,3,8,Randy Marsh,[subdued] Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
2019,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Can I come with you?
2020,3,8,Randy Marsh,[softly] Okay. [rolls his eyes]
2021,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea. [Pip and Dougie are already inside, waiting] Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was."
2022,3,8,Stan Marsh,Rad! [hops on the bed and starts switching channels]
2023,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?"
2024,3,8,Stan Marsh,There are no more missions. I have everything I want. [four shows and a commercial pass by as he channel-surfs.]
2025,3,8,Butters Stotch,Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
2026,3,8,Stan Marsh,[annoyed] Just... play something else! God!
2027,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
2028,3,8,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts."
2029,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, cool!"
2030,3,8,Dougie,I wanna be a reporter someday.
2031,3,8,Reporter,"Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house. [footage of it is shown] According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued."
2032,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits."
2033,3,8,Reporter,The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks. [choppers and tanks are heard coming in] The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.
2034,3,8,Stan Marsh,[as the reporter speaks] Wait a minute [hops off the bed and walks towards the window. He looks out and sees the ATF] Oh my God! [runs back to the others] Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
2035,3,8,Dougie,Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
2036,3,8,Reporter,We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house [Stan looking out the window just moments before] showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!
2037,3,8,Stan Marsh,Dude!
2038,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?"
2039,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission."
2040,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[sits] Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you."
2041,3,8,Randy Marsh,I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
2042,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"So, so now we can't be friends?"
2043,3,8,Randy Marsh,"I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody."
2044,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,We said we'd never tell anybody?
2045,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[now cross] Well, of course we wouldn't."
2046,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, uh I didn't realize that. [looks away ashamed]"
2047,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[sensing betrayal] Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?"
2048,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, uh uh a few people, yeah."
2049,3,8,Randy Marsh,[hushed] What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
2050,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,You didn't say not to tell anyone.
2051,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[hushed] Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! [looks around in desperation to make sure no one else is listening]"
2052,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
2053,3,8,Randy Marsh,AAAW!! [jumps up and hurries away]
2054,3,8,Stan Marsh,[rushes out with the others in tow] Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! [sees everyone quite drunk. A naked man dances by with a lampshade on his head] The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. [the adults didn't hear him]
2055,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?"
2056,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[sees his mom waddle by] Mom, go look outside."
2057,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"[drunk, with mai tai in hand] Mommy's little boopie-kins [falls down and out]"
2058,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh let me handle this, Stan. [walks forward] Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! [The adults laugh and his face drops]"
2059,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. [walks to the door. The others follow]"
2060,3,8,ATF lead,Lay down your weapons!
2061,3,8,Stan Marsh,We don't have any weapons.
2062,3,8,ATF lead,"Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them. [Shooting starts]"
2063,3,8,Butters Stotch,Whoa!
2064,3,8,Stan Marsh,Get back inside! [opens the door and the boys hurry in]
2065,3,8,ATF lead,I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.
2066,3,8,Officer Barbrady,What's the Ganz technique?
2067,3,8,ATF lead,"This is what we did in Waco. [two monster speakers are moved into place on either side of the front of the house. A technician readies the large CD player] Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out. [the technician presses a button and a garbled song plays] Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will."
2068,3,8,Mr Garrison,"That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?"
2069,3,8,Mr Mackey,Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
2070,3,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, hell, turn it up."
2071,3,8,Goateed man,"Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay."
2072,3,8,Other man,"Oh, is he?"
2073,3,8,Randy Marsh,[runs up] Who?!
2074,3,8,Goateed man,Huh?
2075,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Who who did you hear is, is gay?!"
2076,3,8,Goateed man,"Ricky Martin, the singer."
2077,3,8,Randy Marsh,Oh. [the two men walk away as Gerald approaches]
2078,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, Randy, what's up?"
2079,3,8,Randy Marsh,[tenses up] What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
2080,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Huh?
2081,3,8,Randy Marsh,Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
2082,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
2083,3,8,Randy Marsh,There's nothing to talk about.
2084,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"You're having regrets, aren't you?"
2085,3,8,Randy Marsh,"No, I-... I don't know."
2086,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Hey. Talk to me.
2087,3,8,Randy Marsh,No!
2088,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
2089,3,8,Randy Marsh,Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
2090,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do."
2091,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Aaww! [rushes away] Sharon? [finds her at a table and genuflects] Sharon, cuh can we go?"
2092,3,8,Sharon Marsh,[swaying] Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
2093,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[his voice grows urgent] Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now."
2094,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!"
2095,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Ogh, I already did."
2096,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[rushes up with the other boys] Dad! Dad, they shot at us."
2097,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Not now, Stanley. [gets up and walks away. Stan watches him go, then turns to Sharon]"
2098,3,8,Stan Marsh,Mom!
2099,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Whoopee! [gets up, and the bowl of chips drops to the ground. She faints on the table. Stan looks around, not sure how he can rouse the adults to action, drunk as they are.]"
2100,3,8,Butters Stotch,"[panicking] Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families."
2101,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[slaps Butters across the face with a backhand and grabs him by the collar] Get a hold of yourself, man!"
2102,3,8,Butters Stotch,"How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?"
2103,3,8,Stan Marsh,Come on. We have to find out what's happening. [leads the other boys to the bedroom]
2104,3,8,Reporter,"I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?"
2105,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now."
2106,3,8,Dougie,See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
2107,3,8,Reporter,"So what are your plans, commander?"
2108,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out."
2109,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-"
2110,3,8,Stan Marsh,Sh!
2111,3,8,Reporter,"Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander."
2112,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"It is, but we can't let them kill themselves."
2113,3,8,Stan Marsh,We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
2114,3,8,Pip Pirrup,But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
2115,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on."
2116,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. [walks off]"
2117,3,8,Reporter,"For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out."
2118,3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay? [Harold is wearing a lampshade, but he's fully dressed. The camera moves to the crowd, then to the ground, where Dougie is standing with microphone in hand]"
2119,3,8,Dougie,"This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party. [Stan is filming, Butters is cuing] As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us. [aside] Anything else?"
2120,3,8,Stan Marsh,Tell them not to burn us down.
2121,3,8,Dougie,"Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news."
2122,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Now what do we do?
2123,3,8,Stan Marsh,[removing the tape from the camera] Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
2124,3,8,Dougie,"Hey, I'm a real reporter."
2125,3,8,Stan Marsh,"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. [Dougie smiles]"
2126,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs. [turns off the bullhorn and listens for a moment] Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator! [a large truck hauls a large cannon in. The barrel of the cannon reads, ""NEGOTIATOR""]"
2127,3,8,Reporter,"[approaches] Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?"
2128,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
2129,3,8,Reporter,"Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves."
2130,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,[holds out a beanie baby] Look. You see this? You see this?
2131,3,8,Reporter,Yes.
2132,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"You see it? You see it? Go get it. [throws it away to his left] Go get it! [the reporter soon moves in the direction of the throw] Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!"
2133,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Having a good time?
2134,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?"
2135,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-"
2136,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[irritated, interrupts] We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! [walks away]"
2137,3,8,Guest,"Good night, everyone."
2138,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Look out! [Shooting starts. Screams are heard as the guests are hit. The guests die on the spot] Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. [on the bullhorn] People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender! [the Negotiator is aimed right at the front door]"
2139,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, we're out of time! [hops down and moves away. He ties some rope around Butters' middle] Are you sure you can do this, Butters?"
2140,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?"
2141,3,8,Stan Marsh,"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. [hands him the video]"
2142,3,8,Butters Stotch,Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
2143,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Can you hit a target, Pip?"
2144,3,8,Pip Pirrup,[with bow and plunger] I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. [pulls back on the bow]
2145,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Hit something nice and solid now. [Pip releases the plunger, with rope attached, and it lands on the left side of Barbrady's head. Barbrady moves just a bit, then sips his coffee]"
2146,3,8,Pip Pirrup,[pulls the rope taut] I think that's got it.
2147,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Nice job, Pip."
2148,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Did I do a nice job? Really?
2149,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. [he and Dougie help Butters onto the window sill and hook him up to the rope]"
2150,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now. [Dougie pushes him off] Waaah! [slides down to Barbrady and bounces off the hook] Gooh. [runs to the reporter]"
2151,3,8,Stan Marsh,He made it down. [Pip and Dougie grin]
2152,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! [the agents take aim]"
2153,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?"
2154,3,8,Reporter,Huh?
2155,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. [hands it to the reporter, who inspects it]"
2156,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,[walks up] Honey?
2157,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[hushed] God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows."
2158,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
2159,3,8,Randy Marsh,What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
2160,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,I just want to know it meant something to you.
2161,3,8,Randy Marsh,"It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry! [the music stops] All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! [people turn and stare. One man gasps and Sharon lifts her head from the floor]"
2162,3,8,Man in briefs,"Aw, I was just in the hot tub. [a man next to him pulls away]"
2163,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares! [shots of various people looking at him] We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!"
2164,3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it."
2165,3,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmm-me too. [other men begin to answer]
2166,3,8,Man 1,"Yeah, uh I've done it a few times."
2167,3,8,Man 2,Yep.
2168,3,8,Man 3,Yup.
2169,3,8,Man 4,Uh huh.
2170,3,8,Man 5,Me too.
2171,3,8,Man 6,"Myeup, me too."
2172,3,8,Man 7,Yup.
2173,3,8,Jimbo Kern,"Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. [points to the burly man who spoke earlier]"
2174,3,8,Mr. Mackey,"[music resumes] Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita? [she goes to do it, and conversation resumes among the guests]"
2175,3,8,Randy Marsh,You mean it? I'm not gay?
2176,3,8,Jimbo Kern,[walks up] Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
2177,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!"
2178,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,So we're friends again?
2179,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!"
2180,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Alright everyone, fire!"
2181,3,8,Reporter,"[runs in front of the cannon and waves his arms] Hold on just a minute! This is Derek Smalls reporting. We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house [holds it up], proving that the people inside are not cultists after all."
2182,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"[to an agent] Uh oh. [runs to address the agents and waves his arms] Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation."
2183,3,8,Blond agent,Simulation?
2184,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"[to the blond] Sh. [to all] All is well. Do not shoot at [BOOM. The cannonball hits a house behind Mackey's, then bounces to crush another, then another, and yet another. Stan, Pip, and Dougie rush outside to join the reporter.]"
2185,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day! [Butters joins them]"
2186,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,Woops.
2187,3,8,ATF agent,"Sir, this isn't gonna look good."
2188,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"You're right. Quick, let's get out of here! [in the blink of an eye, every ATF agent and vehicle rushes away, leaving a clear road]"
2189,3,8,Derek Smalls,"Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys."
2190,3,8,Dougie,"Wow, you mean that?"
2191,3,8,Derek Smalls,"Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams. [walks away with the tape]"
2192,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!"
2193,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job."
2194,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya."
2195,3,8,Stan Marsh,"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along."
2196,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?"
2197,3,8,Kyle Broflovski,[shows up] Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
2198,3,8,Stan Marsh,You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
2199,3,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh, dude, weak."
2200,3,8,Stan Marsh,Super weak.
2201,3,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. [goes inside with Stan and Ike, leaving the Melvins outside sad.]"
2202,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?"
2203,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!"
2204,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle!
2205,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm coming, Ma! [the doorbell rings]"
2206,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Go get the door, Kyle!"
2207,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[to himself, angrily] ""Get ready"", ""answer the door"", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! [exits]"
2208,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh! Hey, Kenny."
2209,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)"
2210,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee."
2211,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(What's that?)
2212,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure."
2213,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh, that's alright.)"
2214,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
2215,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Really?) [follows Kyle to the sofa, where Kyle's parents now wait]"
2216,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
2217,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing."
2218,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
2219,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Aw.)
2220,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. [Kyle and Kenny have blank stares]"
2221,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout."
2222,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
2223,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
2224,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, eh, the problem is..."
2225,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight."
2226,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?"
2227,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
2228,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Come on, Ike! [he hops in] It's time to go to Squirts!"
2229,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Squirts?)
2230,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
2231,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Oh.)
2232,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. [everyone heads out the door]"
2233,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, ""Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."""
2234,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh.)
2235,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it."
2236,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh!)
2237,3,9,Ike Broflovski,Eng jeck. [takes off his cap]
2238,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!"
2239,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Ike, you behave!"
2240,3,9,Ike Broflovski,Buwor? [takes off his cap again]
2241,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Ike!"
2242,3,9,Ike Broflovski,"Buh buh buh buh. [the cap is back on, the bandana comes off]"
2243,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
2244,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[turns to face the boys] Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout."
2245,3,9,Ike Broflovski,No-o. [takes off the pigtails]
2246,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle."
2247,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,What? You want me to lie?
2248,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, lie."
2249,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--"
2250,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh my God, what is that?! [brakes hard and stop. A big brown bear is walking towards them.]"
2251,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, it's a bear! [the bear turns left and walks into the woods]"
2252,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, cool."
2253,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?"
2254,3,9,Ranger,Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay?
2255,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah. [the boys leave the car] Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back."
2256,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,He was huge.
2257,3,9,Ranger,"Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us."
2258,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,I'm sure they are.
2259,3,9,Gerald Broflovski,"We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys."
2260,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?"
2261,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh?)
2262,3,9,Sheila Broflovski,Try and act Jewish. [drives away. Ike is properly dressed again]
2263,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(How do you do that?)
2264,3,9,Squirt leader,"[arrives with his troop] Come on, Squirt! We're meeting over here! [motions to the place]"
2265,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,[Ike hides behind him] Who are you?
2266,3,9,Squirt leader,"I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts."
2267,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You have to go with him, Ike."
2268,3,9,Ike Broflovski,Buh buh buh buh.
2269,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. [points to it.]"
2270,3,9,Ike Broflovski,Boul ball.
2271,3,9,Squirt leader,"Come on! [drags Ike away. The Squirts leave as well, and the ranger returns]"
2272,3,9,Ranger,Name?
2273,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,Kyle Broflovski.
2274,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Kenny McCormick.)
2275,3,9,Ranger,What?
2276,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg."
2277,3,9,Ranger,"[writes the names] Alright, get to Meshuggeneh Hall! The meeting is already starting."
2278,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(What's that?) [about the CHAMBER OF ELDERS]
2279,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
2280,3,9,Chief elder,"Baleilah hazein, Hame kadesh mekoh hikenazu puanazikeh hakeilah. (Now gather us, the elders, on this most holy of nights.)"
2281,3,9,Elders,"Helalelah, het Moshe. (Praise Moses.)"
2282,3,9,Chief elder,"I want to welcome you all. Though we each come from a different sect of Judaism, on this night of Jewbilee, we all pray to Moses as one. Hineinih kureh leirukeshu. (May all the power of Moses show the way...) Now, let us all introduce ourselves."
2283,3,9,Elder 1,"[with buns on his head] Elder Carn, from the Orthodox synagogue."
2284,3,9,Elder 2,"[with mustache] Elder Harris, from the Hasidic sect."
2285,3,9,Elder 3,"Elder Garth, from the synagogue of anti-Semites."
2286,3,9,Chief elder,[cautiously] I don't believe I've heard of the anti-Semitic sect of Judaism before.
2287,3,9,Elder Garth,We're new.
2288,3,9,Squirt leader,"Okay, Squirts, the elders have given us a very important task tonight. We are all going to make macaroni pictures, like this one, [pulls out a picture of the Star of David made from macaroni] using dry macaroni, paper, and glue."
2289,3,9,Squirt 1,How come we have to make macaroni pictures?
2290,3,9,Squirt leader,"[angrily] Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole!"
2291,3,9,Squirt 2,What's your name?
2292,3,9,Ike Broflovski,No.
2293,3,9,Squirt 2,How come your head is lookin' so... funny-looking?
2294,3,9,Ike Broflovski,Uh-uh. [doffs the hat and pigtails and hops to the window. He sees Kyle and Kenny walk to Meshuggeneh Hall]
2295,3,9,Elder Carn,"And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife [displays them], and you can make nifty soap sculptures like these. Here's a giraffe. [displays it] And here's a cloud. [displays it] You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight. [Kyle and Kenny enter and take their seats] Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands. [several of them raise their hands. None of them wear the Jew Scout cap yet.]"
2296,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. [Kenny does so. The elder spots the new Scouts, but returns to an odd prospect]"
2297,3,9,Elder Carn,"Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?"
2298,3,9,Inductee,Junichi.
2299,3,9,Elder Carn,"O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um... [places his index finger on his lower lip] Cu-could you run out and grab some... some of those candles for us? [Junichi leaves, and the attendant locks the door immediately] There we go. Ahem. [Kyle notices the injustice that has just been done] Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please. [the new Scouts leave their seats and come up]"
2300,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. [Kenny moves forward]"
2301,3,9,Elder Carn,Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
2302,3,9,The Jew Scouts and Inductees,I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
2303,3,9,Elder Carn,"My honor, wide and true."
2304,3,9,The Jew Scouts and Inductees,"My honor, wide and true."
2305,3,9,Elder Carn,I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
2306,3,9,The Jew Scouts and Inductees,I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
2307,3,9,Elder Carn,"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew."
2308,3,9,The Jew Scouts and Inductees,"Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew."
2309,3,9,Elder Carn,[brings forth a large bell] Nahit chaim.
2310,3,9,Inductee 1,"Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head and strikes it once to produce a long, loud peal, then raises it. The boy walks off]"
2311,3,9,Elder Carn,Nahit chaim.
2312,3,9,Inductee 2,"Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head, strikes it, and raises it. The boy stumbles away crying]"
2313,3,9,Elder Carn,Nahit chaim.
2314,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Nahit chaim.) [the elder lowers the bell over his head, strikes it, but Kenny ducks] (Ha! Hiheh haha.) [the elder lowers it again and strikes it several times to make sure] (Hah! Oh my God!)"
2315,3,9,Squirt leader,"Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael?"
2316,3,9,Ishmael,Apple.
2317,3,9,Squirt leader,Good. Matthew?
2318,3,9,Matthew,Cat.
2319,3,9,Squirt leader,Joseph?
2320,3,9,Joseph,Triangle.
2321,3,9,Squirt leader,Okay. Ike?
2322,3,9,Ike Broflovski,Cokeshen.
2323,3,9,Squirt leader,"[gasps] ...You don't make a macaroni picture of the Last Supper at a Jewish camp! [growling and other noises are heard] What the geez? [outside, a bear is searching through trashcans. The leader goes to the window] Oh my God, it's that bear they've been talking about! [the bear looks back, then jumps and runs away, leaving the trashcans strewn about and trash everywhere. The leader walks out with the Squirts] Where did it go?! Squirts, go grab your gear! We're gonna hunt us a bear! Then I'll get my chutzpah badge for sure!"
2324,3,9,Chief Elder,"Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit. (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.)"
2325,3,9,Elder Garth,"[losing patience] Oh, enough already. What has Moses ever done for us?"
2326,3,9,Chief elder,All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.
2327,3,9,Elder Garth,"Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--"
2328,3,9,Chief elder,"Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!"
2329,3,9,Elder Garth,"All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews."
2330,3,9,Elder Harris,"We pray to Moses here, elder."
2331,3,9,Elder Garth,"If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!"
2332,3,9,Chief elder,"We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!"
2333,3,9,Elder Garth,"Fine! [goes to the door and turns] Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see this very night! [walks out and closes the door.]"
2334,3,9,Chief elder,Hello.
2335,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle."
2336,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(What the fuck are we doing?)
2337,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
2338,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)"
2339,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!"
2340,3,9,Chief elder,"Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance. [spreads his arms out. All the Scouts close their eyes save Kenny, who looks around first, then closes them.] Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage."
2341,3,9,The Jew Scouts and Inductees,May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively.
2342,3,9,All,"[the elder first, then the Scouts join him one by one] O..."
2343,3,9,Elder Garth,"[behind a nearby tree] Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything! [softens to pray] Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth."
2344,3,9,Squirt leader,"We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurtsWhen we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts[gasps. The brown bear is in front of him approaching a pile of crap] There he is, Squirts. [the bear turns up its snout, but sniffs again] Okay, Squirts. Remember the plan: immobilize and attack. Matthew, y-you immobilize the bear with the net, then Echo team, run up and attack it with your Squirt knives. [the bear sniffs some more] Don't get too close now, just close enough to throw the net on the stupid bear. [Matthew goes forward with the net. The leader and the other Squirts hide behind some bushes and watch. The leader then barks] Now! [the bear turns to see Matthew and growls, and Matthew throws the net on himself]"
2345,3,9,Matthew,"Oh, funt. [the bear takes the net and carries Matthew away] No!"
2346,3,9,Squirt leader,"Oh, no! [the bear disappears] Oh, God! [comes out of the bush with the Squirts] Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now!"
2347,3,9,All,[long note] O... [the Scouts are now holding hands as they chant]
2348,3,9,Kenny McCormick,[notices some rumbling] (What's happening now?)
2349,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at him] Shh. Shut up, Kenny. [rejoins the rest in chanting, the fire builds, and a huge techno-colored dreidel rises out of the fire. A face appears on it]"
2350,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(What the fuck is that?!)
2351,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops long enough to say] That's Moses, stupid! [rejoins the rest in chanting]"
2352,3,9,Chief elder,"Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming."
2353,3,9,Moses,The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah!
2354,3,9,All,Aaaaaaaaaah!
2355,3,9,Chief elder,"Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased. [the Scouts approach Moses one by one, offer their sculptures, and drop them off before him]"
2356,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps up and offers his] It's a duck. [Kenny steps up, but he's just starting on his sculpture]"
2357,3,9,Elder Garth,"""And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith."" Conch shell, like this one, hnee. [produces one from his robes]"
2358,3,9,Chief elder,"Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second. [walks up to Elder Harris] Where the hell are the Squirts? [Elder Harris shrugs] We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now!"
2359,3,9,Squirt leader,"Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison. [reviews his work] Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray! [the Squirts start heaving] Chutzpah badge, here I come. [the bear shows up and growls] Yikes! [runs for the bushes and reaches the Squirts] Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts. [the bear comes closer, sniffing] Okay, Squirt, lower the tray. [the Squirt begins to lower it] That's it. That's it, you god-damned stupid bearface! [the bear rears up and pounces on the tray, jerking the rope.]"
2360,3,9,Squirt,Agghhh! [the leader gasps. The Squirt is pulled into the air and lands in the tray] Ah--! [the bear carries him off] Agghhh!
2361,3,9,Squirt leader,"Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt!"
2362,3,9,Ike Broflovski,Mommy.
2363,3,9,Squirt leader,"[steps out of the bush with the Squirts] You think you can stop me from getting my chutzpah badge, you stupid bear?! Think again!"
2364,3,9,All,"Kumbaya, my Lord, KumbayaO Lord, Kumbaya"
2365,3,9,Chief elder,"Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children?"
2366,3,9,Moses,I desire... [the elders and the Scouts await anxiously] I desire... mamaroni pictures.
2367,3,9,Chief elder,"Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people?"
2368,3,9,Moses,I desire... popcorn necklaces.
2369,3,9,Chief elder,"You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away! [the elders and Scouts scatter] All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread. [Kenny finishes his sculpture, which is of himself, as the last few Scouts leave. He then offers it and leaves it on the pile]"
2370,3,9,Moses,Hold! [Kenny stops in his tracks as Kyle looks on. Kenny looks at Moses] There is... an impurity.
2371,3,9,Elder Garth,"[still behind the tree] Oh no, he's on to me, Haman."
2372,3,9,Chief elder,"[the Scouts gasp and Kenny droops] An impurity, Moses?"
2373,3,9,Moses,This child here is not kosher.
2374,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Uh-oh.) [Garth looks, curious. Kyle rushes to Kenny's side, and the Scouts move in on them] (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)"
2375,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,Don't worry. I know what to do.
2376,3,9,Chief elder,"Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?! [the Scouts grow angry]"
2377,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish."
2378,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(What?!) [the Elders and Scouts approach Kyle and Kenny closer]
2379,3,9,Chief elder,A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!
2380,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)"
2381,3,9,Chief elder,You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake.
2382,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(What?!)
2383,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,He doesn't get cake?
2384,3,9,Moses,No cake for the impurity.
2385,3,9,Chief elder,"Go now. You do not belong here. [points to the woods. Kenny comes out of the middle of the group and walks towards the woods. Kyle is sad for him. Kenny looks back, then faces forward and walks on]"
2386,3,9,Moses,[spins around and around] Aaggghhh! [the others turn to see what's happening]
2387,3,9,Elder Garth,"[prostrated, with conch in hand] Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud!"
2388,3,9,Chief elder,"Elder, what are you doing?!"
2389,3,9,Elder Garth,[now standing with hands outstretched] Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht!
2390,3,9,Elder Harris,He's reading from the Book of Haman!
2391,3,9,Elder Garth,"Enter the conch shell, Moses! [thrusts the shell forward]"
2392,3,9,Moses,[spins and shrinks to fit in the shell] Eo! Eh! Diu! [disappears into the shell]
2393,3,9,Elder Garth,"And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity!"
2394,3,9,Chief elder,"Elder, what have you done?"
2395,3,9,Elder Garth,"I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I am running Jewbilee now!"
2396,3,9,Elder Carn,"[from Orientation] Release Moses, now!"
2397,3,9,Elder Garth,[pulls out a gun] I don't think so. [all gasp]
2398,3,9,Scout,When do we get to eat carrot cake?
2399,3,9,Elder Garth,"Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand!"
2400,3,9,Chief Elder,"Elder, you cannot mean--"
2401,3,9,Elder Garth,"Move! [drives them towards the building. Kenny peeks out from behind a tree. Garth follows the last of the Scouts to the door, closes it, and padlocks it. He descends the steps and heads for the campfire as the others look on through the window, frightened] Now! Now, Haman, your time has come!"
2402,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what the hell is going on?!"
2403,3,9,Chief elder,"If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed."
2404,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Oh no!)
2405,3,9,Squirt leader,"We are Jew Squirts, we know JewishStick stick smiley smiley Stick stick smiley smileydur dur dur dur dur--Hold it, Squirts! This is where we'll set our trap. Everyone remember your squadron. Alpha-5 and Gamma-7 will be on recon teams. Alpha will take left flank and flush the bear out of sector three. Once we're in position, I want constant contact between all squad leaders. We'll flush him out and we'll attack him! [the bear comes up silently and snatches another Squirt]"
2406,3,9,Squirt,Agh! Agghh! [the bear rushes away]
2407,3,9,Squirt leader,"[not missing a beat] Remember, this is only a bear. All we have to do is stick together, and we can spend the rest of the night making bear sandwiches! [turns and counts his troop] Where's Zigmal?"
2408,3,9,Ike Broflovski,No.
2409,3,9,Squirt leader,"God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?!"
2410,3,9,Elder Garth,And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people! [clouds roll in and the winds whip Elder Garth's hair around] And it was the night that stars flew around the sky! [the meteor shower goes by] Yes! Yess!!
2411,3,9,Chief elder,"If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear."
2412,3,9,Scout,I wanna go home.
2413,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Stop!) [a red car speeds by. Kenny watches it leave, then hears more vehicles coming] (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!) [Barbrady and the ATF speed by as well] (Shit!)"
2414,3,9,Squirt leader,"That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well, I'm not gonna let a stupid bear get the-- [gasp] Hold! Look over there! [a figure resembling a Squirt stands alone in a clearing in front of a cliff] It's one of the Squirts the bear took. Maybe he's okay. [takes the Squirts over to the figure to make sure. They arrive, only to see a straw Squirt - straw dressed in a Squirt uniform. The Squirt leader looks at the straw Squirt long and hard before deciding] It's a trap!! [jumps out of the way as a net descends and traps the rest of the Squirts. The full net rises to a high branch; the bear comes to the edge of the cliff and carries it away] Damn! Damn, damn, damn! Okay, bear, that does it! You wanna kill all the Squirts?! You can have 'em! I give up! I don't need my chutzpah badge, or Jew Scouts, or any of this crap! Forget it!"
2415,3,9,Elder Garth,Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again!
2416,3,9,Chief elder,No! [Kenny walks into the camp again]
2417,3,9,Elder Garth,"We await your return, Haman! [Kenny stops to see Elder Garth at work] Your passage is safe from the enemies!"
2418,3,9,Kenny McCormick,[the bear finds him and carries him off] (Aghh!)
2419,3,9,Chief Elder,It's hopeless.
2420,3,9,Elder Carn,"Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die. [the Scouts are scared]"
2421,3,9,Elder Harris,Uh I'm fine with obeying.
2422,3,9,Elder Carn,"Yeah, obeying should work out swell. [!]"
2423,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us."
2424,3,9,Elder 2,How?
2425,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny will find a way.
2426,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Haaarrrrrh!) [the bear drops him off and leaves the cave] (Huh?)
2427,3,9,Squirt,"Hey, welcome to the party. [Kenny studies the scene] See this li'l bear cub? It's his birthday."
2428,3,9,Squirt 2,"Yeah, so his mommy brought us all over to play with him."
2429,3,9,Bear cub,Mrar.
2430,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Aww.) [the momma bear comes and licks a Squirt's face, and the Squirt laughs] (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... [indistinct chatter])"
2431,3,9,Squirt,They are? Uh oh.
2432,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)"
2433,3,9,Squirt,"Come on, Squirts. We have to help them."
2434,3,9,All,"Yeah! [everyone, including the cub, races out of the cave]"
2435,3,9,Squirt leader,"Elder Schwartz, I lost the Squirts! I lost all the Squirts! [no answer] Well, screw you too! I don't need your Chutzpah badge anyway! Hello? [in the building behind him, heads rise from under the window sill]"
2436,3,9,Elder Schwartz,"[the chief elder] Shlomo, get us out of here!"
2437,3,9,Shlomo,[Squirt leader] What the geez? [turns and walked towards the hostages] What are you guys doing in there?
2438,3,9,Elder Schwartz,Get the keys and unlock the door! [the Scouts jump up and down]
2439,3,9,Schlomo,What?!
2440,3,9,Elder Schwartz,[now points] Get the keys and unlock the door!
2441,3,9,Schlomo,"[doesn't understand what Schwartz is saying, but gives his own news] I lost the Squirts! [Elder Garth appears behind him]"
2442,3,9,Elder Schwartz,Look out!
2443,3,9,Schlomo,Huh? [turns to face Garth]
2444,3,9,Elder Garth,Don't move!
2445,3,9,Schlomo,"[backs up quick] Oh, Jiminy gravy, what is this??"
2446,3,9,Elder Garth,"It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh!"
2447,3,9,Schlomo,You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say?
2448,3,9,Elder Garth,Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith!
2449,3,9,Schlomo,"[sees the shell and dives for it] Oh, no you don't! [grabs it, but Farth shoots him. The bullet grazes Schlomo's right shoulder, which he then covers with his left hand, dropping the shell] Ooowww!!"
2450,3,9,Elder Garth,"Enough of this waste of time! [turns and goes back to the campfire. Once there, he reaches for the Book of Haman] Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! Einich! Hos!"
2451,3,9,Elder Schwartz,It is lost.
2452,3,9,Elder Garth,Zayak. Kareem! [Kenny comes up behind him]
2453,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!) [takes off with the book]
2454,3,9,Elder Garth,"Hey, give that back! [chases Kenny into the woods. The Squirts line up before the window where the hostages await]"
2455,3,9,Elder Schwartz,It's the Squirts.
2456,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, Ike!"
2457,3,9,Elder Schwartz,"Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there."
2458,3,9,Elder Harris,They'll never reach.
2459,3,9,Squirt,"Squirts, fall in. Chinese formation. [the Squirts hurry and climb up one on top of another to form a human pillar]"
2460,3,9,Elder Garth,Give me that book! [knocks Kenny down]
2461,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Ow!) [gives up the book, and Garth kicks him]"
2462,3,9,Elder Garth,Haman will deal with you! [kicks him again]
2463,3,9,Kenny McCormick,(Ow!)
2464,3,9,Elder Harris,"Oh, no. It's too late!"
2465,3,9,Elder Garth,"Ramek shtud! [lightning strikes the ground. Nearby, the bear returns and gets the conch shell. She moves away, only to take it to Kenny, who receives it. The bear growls and leaves. Meteors continue to shower down as a black cloud with a pair of red eyes appears among the gathering clouds]"
2466,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,What is that?
2467,3,9,Elder Schwartz,It is Haman.
2468,3,9,Elder Garth,"Yes! Yes! [Kenny tries to break the conch shell open on a rock, then against the tree, but it doesn't break]"
2469,3,9,Haman,Free! Free to punish those that imprisoned me!
2470,3,9,Elder Garth,"[now prostrate before Haman] Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you!"
2471,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,Look! [Kenny comes into the clearing and throws the shell against the snow several times.]
2472,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(It's okay, I'll use my head!) [faces the shell and throws his head back]"
2473,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! Noooooo!
2474,3,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Heeeeeyah! Ugh--!) [the headbutt opened the shell alright, but Kenny falls back on his side as Moses comes out of the broken shell]"
2475,3,9,Haman,Moses! Nooo!
2476,3,9,Elder Garth,"Nooo! Eheh. Nooo! [Moses rises into the sky, absorbs Haman, and reclaims his place above the campfire. Elder Garth turns to face him again] Moses. Uh I, I apologize for any inconvenience, eheh. Uh yuh you see, I was just uh--"
2477,3,9,Moses,Die! [lightning comes out of both his eyes and nukes Garth until Garth explodes]
2478,3,9,Elder Garth,No! Aaagghhh! Ooww..! [poof]
2479,3,9,All,[gathering] Hooray!
2480,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny! [runs to Kenny, who now lies in a pool of blood. The others follow]"
2481,3,9,Elder Harris,That blow to his head must have killed him.
2482,3,9,Elder Carn,He saved us. He saved all the Jews.
2483,3,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass."
2484,3,9,Elder Harris,"We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny."
2485,3,9,Moses,[joins them next to Kenny] Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.
2486,3,9,Elder Harris,Yes.
2487,3,9,Moses,And those little shaker things where... you put beans inside of paper plates that are glued together.
2488,3,9,Elder Harris,Paper-plate bean shakers.
2489,3,9,Moses,And let us put patterns of glue on the outside of those paper plates so we can then pour glitter on them so they can look nice and sparkly.
2490,3,9,Elder Schwartz,"You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to work!"
2491,3,10,KOZY DJ,"[with classic 1970's big hair] We're here live at the KOZY 102.1 Halloween Haunt at the South Park docks! Come on down! We've got a haunted house [Chef finished pinning a banner on the top right corner of the stage] and everyone is decorating for tomorrow night, [one man pins a rubber bat to a shack roof, another walks past with a jack-o-lantern] HALLOWEEN, when the band KoRn, that's right, KoRn, is going to play live! And don't forget to wear a costume tomorrow, because there's a big first prize! Why, here's some kids enjoying the Halloween Haunt now! [Kenny, Kyle, and Stan walk past, but turn to face the DJ] Say boys, what do you think of KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far? [lowers the boom mic to Stan]"
2492,3,10,Stan Marsh,"This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. [turns and walks away with Kyle and Kenny]"
2493,3,10,KOZY DJ,"Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids."
2494,3,10,Eric Cartman,Hey you guys! [they stop] You know what time of year it is?
2495,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween."
2496,3,10,Eric Cartman,"That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—"
2497,3,10,Stan Marsh,Christmas?
2498,3,10,Eric Cartman,—Christmastime is presents for me.
2499,3,10,Jimbo Kern,"Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house."
2500,3,10,Guests in line,Awwww! [all leave. The boys walk by]
2501,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Eeyyy [Kyle stops, the others walk away], Spooky Laboratory, you guys. [""THIS WAY TO SPOOKY LABORATORY"" The entrance doors are stained with blood]"
2502,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[annoyed] Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff."
2503,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory! [throws open the doors and enters] Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells..."
2504,3,10,Guide,"Welcome to Spooky Laboratory. [pulls out a blindfold and puts it over Cartman's eyes] I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow me to show around the lab. [leads him to a table on which is a bowl of eggs and a bowl of lime Jell-o cubes]"
2505,3,10,Eric Cartman,Cool!
2506,3,10,Dr Spookalot,[helps him up to a chair] Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.
2507,3,10,Eric Cartman,[rolls his fingers around the eggs] Ewww-hoohooo.
2508,3,10,Dr Spookalot,[switches bowls] And here you can feel the brains.
2509,3,10,Eric Cartman,"[rolls his fingers through the lime Jell-o cubes] Oh-HO, grohoss."
2510,3,10,Dr Spookalot,[leads him to an ass] And here you can feel the warm innards of the body [Cartman reaches into the ass's ass and the ass looks surprised]
2511,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!"
2512,3,10,Kenny McCormick,"(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)"
2513,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[two older boys peek out from behind some boxes, then drop down] Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. [the boy with his picture on the shirt pops out and faces them]"
2514,3,10,Boy in Green Shirt,BOO!
2515,3,10,Stan Marsh,Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
2516,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
2517,3,10,Kenny McCormick,Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
2518,3,10,Boy in Green Shirt,"Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!"
2519,3,10,Stan Marsh,W-we weren't scared!
2520,3,10,Boy in Green Shirt,"Oh no? Well, you should be! [walks towards them] The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!"
2521,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,The what?
2522,3,10,Boy in Green Shirt,Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.
2523,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Nuh-uh.
2524,3,10,Boy in Green Shirt,Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands [molds his left hand into a hook] looking for victims tuh... [swipes it through the air] cut up!
2525,3,10,Kenny McCormick,[Kyle gasps] (Hoh!)
2526,3,10,Stan Marsh,That's just an old legend.
2527,3,10,Pirate Ghost cutout,[pops up] Rar!
2528,3,10,Stan Marsh,Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
2529,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
2530,3,10,Kenny McCormick,Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
2531,3,10,Boy in Green Shirt,"[the cutout drops to reveal another friend] Ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha! [both his friends flank him now] Just wait till tomorrow! We're gonna scare you kids to death! Ha ha ha haa! [the three move away]"
2532,3,10,Eric Cartman,"[arrives] You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. [starts sniffing it]"
2533,3,10,Stan Marsh,I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
2534,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
2535,3,10,KOZY DJ,"Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?"
2536,3,10,Priest Maxi,Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!
2537,3,10,KOZY DJ,"Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?"
2538,3,10,Priest Maxi,"KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!"
2539,3,10,KOZY DJ,"Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime [suddenly soft] here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow."
2540,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary."
2541,3,10,Eric Cartman,"We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary."
2542,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"That's not scary, fatass!"
2543,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! [all turn left and walk off. As they walk towards the shore, they pass a shack. After they pass, three pirate ghosts peek out from behind the shack, scowling]"
2544,3,10,Pirate Ghosts,Darrrr!
2545,3,10,Jonathan,Are you sure we're goin' the right way?
2546,3,10,David,I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.
2547,3,10,Head,"That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead! [canned laughter]"
2548,3,10,David,[spins the map around and realizes his error] Oops.
2549,3,10,Fieldy,When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.
2550,3,10,Jonathan,Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!
2551,3,10,Munky,I know! A t-ree!
2552,3,10,Jonathan,You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.
2553,3,10,David,A road?
2554,3,10,Jonathan,"That's it! [they pass the South Park Docks sign, and then the three pirate ghosts show up to watch]"
2555,3,10,Pirates,Darrrr!
2556,3,10,Jonathan,"Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P."
2557,3,10,Head,The letter P?
2558,3,10,Fieldy,What the heck starts with the letter P?
2559,3,10,Jonathan,[trembling] Puh-pirate ghosts! [the ghosts appear in front of the van]
2560,3,10,All,"Aaaaah! [the van swerves left to avoid the ghosts, but ends up going over a hillside. It finally settles upside down at the foot of the hill]"
2561,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay [sits on the sofa], let's see. [softly] I waant... thiis... aand... this... [a truck] and... [flips the page] let's see, comes with so... [the Phillip doll. The doorbell rings] ...comes with two bars [circles the boxed doll], so there we go, have that... [a door opens in the background] and, let's see..."
2562,3,10,Liane Cartman,"[walks up to him] Eric, your little friends are here."
2563,3,10,Eric Cartman,"[excited, motions with the catalog] Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?"
2564,3,10,Liane Cartman,"E-heric, it's only Halloween."
2565,3,10,Eric Cartman,That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
2566,3,10,Stan Marsh,"[walks up with Kyle and Kenny] Come on, fatass, we have to go!"
2567,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat! [Liane starts to giggle. Cartman is hurt] Mom, don't laugh."
2568,3,10,Liane Cartman,"I'm sorry, hon,"
2569,3,10,Eric Cartman,[to his friends] I can't go with you guys right now.
2570,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Yes you can, porky. [Liane giggles again]"
2571,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Mom, seriously! [her giggles die down]"
2572,3,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, he's big-boned."
2573,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. [Liane bursts out laughing]"
2574,3,10,Eric Cartman,"God-damnit, mom!"
2575,3,10,Eric Cartman,"[closes the door] God, I hate you guys!"
2576,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders."
2577,3,10,Eric Cartman,How?
2578,3,10,Stan Marsh,What's the scariest thing we could get?
2579,3,10,Eric Cartman,[quietly] Spooky spider?
2580,3,10,Stan Marsh,"No! [turns, then says gravely] A dead body."
2581,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fatass, a dead body."
2582,3,10,Eric Cartman,"You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?"
2583,3,10,Stan Marsh,"We could never make one that looks real enough. [his voice lowers] To be really scary, it would have to be real."
2584,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!"
2585,3,10,Eric Cartman,So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
2586,3,10,Stan Marsh,[voice low] We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
2587,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up- [stops] Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??"
2588,3,10,Stan Marsh,"[appeasing] Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?"
2589,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Are you insane?!
2590,3,10,Eric Cartman,U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
2591,3,10,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
2592,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
2593,3,10,Stan Marsh,"All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,"
2594,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[uneasy] Naww, let's dig up somebody else."
2595,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to."
2596,3,10,Eric Cartman,This is gonna be fun!
2597,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you."
2598,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!"
2599,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[shines his light on a tombstone] This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma. [turns off the light. The boys have a moment of silence]"
2600,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, let's dig 'er up! [walks to the grave and jabs his shovel in]"
2601,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
2602,3,10,Stan Marsh,Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
2603,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
2604,3,10,Eric Cartman,"[taunting] ""Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!"" [Kyle smacks him with the shovel] Ow."
2605,3,10,Stan Marsh,"You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!"
2606,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't really care, dude."
2607,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Yes you do! Now, dig! [all four begin to dig]"
2608,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""You-hoo""..."
2609,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three! [they pry the door open, and then jump back and peer in] Whoa, dude."
2610,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, my God. [the corpse sways to the right, against the casket wall] Hi, ...Grandma."
2611,3,10,A voice,"Hi, Kyle."
2612,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,[hops back] Aaaah!
2613,3,10,Eric Cartman,"[providing the voice] Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?"
2614,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!"
2615,3,10,Stan Marsh,"[chuckling] Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh."
2616,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Heh heh, I'm sweet."
2617,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!"
2618,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Okay, grab the sled. [Kenny goes and pulls it up. The others stand aside. When the sled abuts the casket, Cartman pulls at the corpse with his shovel, and it falls forward onto the sled]"
2619,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city..."
2620,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders."
2621,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
2622,3,10,Eric Cartman,"We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: ""Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"""
2623,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!"
2624,3,10,Male voice,[off screen] O-o-o-o-oh. [thunderclaps. The boys are afraid.]
2625,3,10,Stan Marsh,Who was that?
2626,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman?!
2627,3,10,Eric Cartman,It wasn't me! [camera pans to the corpse]
2628,3,10,Male voice,Who-o-oa.
2629,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, not cool. This is scary. [Some rustling, and a member of KoRn shows up]"
2630,3,10,The Boys,Wa-a-a-ah!
2631,3,10,Munky,"Hey! Like, it's just some kids."
2632,3,10,Jonathan,"Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second."
2633,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Hay, you're that band KoRn."
2634,3,10,Jonathan,"Yeah. I'm Jonathan [with the high forehead], and this is Munky [with chiseled looks], David [with thick eyebrows], Fieldy [short, with white cap], and Head [with dreadlocks]. And over there is our pal, Nibblet. [the mates look around] Hey, where'd Nibblet go?"
2635,3,10,Nibblet,"[a yellow bird with curled antennae and a great wing span ripping into a bag of chips] Uh-huh, Nibblet likes potato chips."
2636,3,10,KoRn,Nibblet!
2637,3,10,Nibblet,[stops] Okay.
2638,3,10,Stan Marsh,What are you guys doing out here?
2639,3,10,Head,We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.
2640,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders."
2641,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
2642,3,10,Stan Marsh,Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
2643,3,10,Jonathan,"Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?"
2644,3,10,Stan Marsh,"[points to it] Yeah, dude. It's right over there."
2645,3,10,KoRn,"O-kay! [they walk away and pass by the priest, who is nailing a post into place: ""Halloween is Anti-God."" He stops.]"
2646,3,10,Jonathan,"Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow."
2647,3,10,Priest Maxi,I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!
2648,3,10,Jonathan,Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?
2649,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. [Cartman hides the body behind the boxes]"
2650,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
2651,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! [they start walking away]"
2652,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
2653,3,10,Kenny McCormick,(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
2654,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!"
2655,3,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) [The dog returns and sniffs the body from a distance. It approaches slowly, sniffing. Then it lifts the covering and drags the body away.]"
2656,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Hold on, kids. [grabs the candy bowl next to the door and opens the door with it in hand]"
2657,3,10,Brunet,Mrs. Broflovski?
2658,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,Yes?
2659,3,10,Brunet,We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?
2660,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Eehh, sure, come in. [they follow her in and sit on the sofa. She takes the armchair, and they look at each other] What is it?"
2661,3,10,Brunet,Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.
2662,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,Defiled? How?
2663,3,10,Blond,"Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up."
2664,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,Dug her up? Why??
2665,3,10,Brunet,Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
2666,3,10,Blond,Yeahp.
2667,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,What?!
2668,3,10,Brunet,"Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak."
2669,3,10,Blond,"Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable."
2670,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Hoh, dear God!"
2671,3,10,Brunet,Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
2672,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,[sadly rubs her eyes] Oooh.
2673,3,10,Blond,"No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it."
2674,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,[helplessly] O-o-o-o-oh!
2675,3,10,Brunet,"Yes. And, now for the difficult part."
2676,3,10,Blond,Brace yourself.
2677,3,10,Brunet,"It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like — an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-"
2678,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!"
2679,3,10,Brunet,...Do?
2680,3,10,Blond,"Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen."
2681,3,10,Brunet,"Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something."
2682,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,O-o-ogh! [gets up and walks away. The men just sit there]
2683,3,10,Brunet,"[to the blond] Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition. [the blond indicates he's thinking by placing his index finger to his lips]"
2684,3,10,Delivery Man,Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?
2685,3,10,Eric Cartman,"A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!"
2686,3,10,Delivery Man,"Sign heah, and heah, and heah. [Cartman signs and the delivery man goes away. Cartman closes the door and dances with glee]"
2687,3,10,Eric Cartman,"I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present! [stops] ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner. [lifts up a corner of the wrapping] Let's see here. [yanks the wrapping off and away] That's good, I'll rewrap it later! [the box reads, ""LIFESIZED Blow-Up ANTONIO BANDERAS LOVE DOLL. WITH REALISTIC GENITALIA""] Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia. [takes the doll out] Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! [blows it up through the penis]"
2688,3,10,KOZY DJ,"It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes! [a ghost and Ultraman walk by while a joker stands next to the boxes. Stan and Kyle are nearby in their costumes]"
2689,3,10,Stan Marsh,[a cowboy sheriff in white] Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. [Kyle is a clown in a yellow jacket]
2690,3,10,Eric Cartman,[walks up with the doll and jingles] Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
2691,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Where's your costume, fatass?"
2692,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like ""Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"" [heavy machinery is heard, and the boys look up to see an ED-209 unit walking towards them. It stops, turns, and settles into place]"
2693,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Kenny."
2694,3,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)"
2695,3,10,Eric Cartman,"U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!"
2696,3,10,Stan Marsh,[rushes his friends along] Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! [Cartman goes for the sled] This is gonna be sweet
2697,3,10,Eric Cartman,"[pulls out the sled, but the body is gone] Uuh, problem, guys."
2698,3,10,Stan Marsh,What's the problem?
2699,3,10,Eric Cartman,Nno Grandma.
2700,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,No Grandma??
2701,3,10,Eric Cartman,Nno Grandma.
2702,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,[turns and reaches the sled. Stan turns as well] She's not here!
2703,3,10,Stan Marsh,She has to be here! [Kenny meanders]
2704,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!"
2705,3,10,Barbrady,"Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? [leaves. The watchmen step up]"
2706,3,10,Brunet,"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like. [Alan shows the sketch]"
2707,3,10,Crowd,Ee-oooh!
2708,3,10,Brunet,"Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like. [Alan pulls out a jar of mayonnaise and jams his fist into it, proceeding to simulate the act. He begins to look surprised at what he's doing as his arm gets covered with mayonnaise]"
2709,3,10,Crowd,Awwwgh! [Alan continues]
2710,3,10,Man,"Excuse me, how is this helping?"
2711,3,10,Barbrady,"That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt."
2712,3,10,Pirate voice,"Noo! Don't go to the docks! [the camera looks up to see a pirate ghost floating outside the Mayor's office] Aarrrgh! [the crowd gasps and screams] Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay! [the crowd is afraid. Women scream] Fire the cannon! [a pirate ship appears high above the road, and a cannon goes off. The ball lands amid the crowd and leaves a crater. Bodies are strewn all over] Har harharharhar! [the crowd disperses. A couple runs into another pirate ghost]"
2713,3,10,Pirate Ghost 2,Arrrgh! [slices their heads off with his sword]
2714,3,10,Captain Bly,We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks! [the pirates and their ship disappear]
2715,3,10,Priest Maxi,"[rushed to the podium] I warned you! I told you this would happen! [survivors sit up and begin to look his way] When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!"
2716,3,10,Jonathan,"Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts."
2717,3,10,KOZY DJ,"Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled."
2718,3,10,Jonathan,Cancelled?
2719,3,10,KOZY DJ,"You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you. [leaves]"
2720,3,10,Jonathan,"Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up."
2721,3,10,The Others,Awww. [Stan and friends walk towards the stage]
2722,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!"
2723,3,10,Munky,"Oh, hey! The kids from last night."
2724,3,10,Head,Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll? [Kenny catches up with his friends]
2725,3,10,David,"Hey, Kenny."
2726,3,10,Kenny McCormick,"[frustrated] (Aw, man!) [he can't impress anyone]"
2727,3,10,Jonathan,"Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum."
2728,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Somebody took my dead grandma.
2729,3,10,Fieldy,What?
2730,3,10,Stan Marsh,"We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away."
2731,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. [starts to sob]
2732,3,10,Fieldy,"Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry."
2733,3,10,Jonathan,"Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts."
2734,3,10,David,"They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates."
2735,3,10,Jonathan,Huh?
2736,3,10,David,"""Pirate ghost"" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate."
2737,3,10,Munky,"No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates."
2738,3,10,Fieldy,"You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact."
2739,3,10,Jonathan,But that makes them pirate ghosts.
2740,3,10,David,No. It makes them ghost pirates.
2741,3,10,Munky,Pirate ghosts!
2742,3,10,Head,Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.
2743,3,10,Jonathan,Pirate ghosts.
2744,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Then, you'll help us?"
2745,3,10,Jonathan,"Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery."
2746,3,10,The Boys,Al-right!
2747,3,10,Chef,Is everybody okay?
2748,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,[people gather around Chef] People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
2749,3,10,Gerald Broflovski,"I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play."
2750,3,10,Mr Garrison,He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
2751,3,10,Sharon Marsh,"Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!"
2752,3,10,Crowd,Yeah! [various exclamations follow]
2753,3,10,Randy Marsh,Lynch mob! [torches and pitch forks appear and the crowd begins to move]
2754,3,10,Man,Down with KoRn!
2755,3,10,Jonathan,So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.
2756,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Right. [Kenny walks along the shore way in the background]
2757,3,10,Stan Marsh,Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
2758,3,10,Jonathan,"Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues."
2759,3,10,Stan Marsh,How should we split up?
2760,3,10,Jonathan,"I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way, [points to his right] and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way. [points to his left]"
2761,3,10,KoRn,"O-kay! [the groups separates in two. In the secure group are Stan, Kyle, Jonathan, Munky, and Fieldy. In the insecure group are Cartman, Kenny, David, and Head]"
2762,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! That was easy.
2763,3,10,Randy Marsh,[excitedly] Here's their van! Here's their van!
2764,3,10,Woman,Let's flip it over!
2765,3,10,Some Folks,Yeah!
2766,3,10,Barbrady,"[moves to intervene] Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top. [the crowd moves in and starts pushing. Even Barbrady participates]"
2767,3,10,Man,Devil worshipers! [the van tips over]
2768,3,10,Crowd,Yeah!
2769,3,10,Man 2,"Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!"
2770,3,10,Stan Marsh,This place gives me the creeps.
2771,3,10,Jonathan,"Say, this looks like a clue. [picks up a book: ""Pirate Lore of South Park, By A.R.R. Robbins""] ""Pirate Lore of South Park."" Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates? [something metallic falls]"
2772,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa. What was that?
2773,3,10,Jonathan,"The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody! [opens a door and goes in. The rest follow]"
2774,3,10,Fieldy,"[runs into a supporting pole] Oh, no! I lost my glasses."
2775,3,10,Head,What does this dead grandma look like?
2776,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff."
2777,3,10,David,"Hey, I got an idea. [all stop] We should set a groovy trap."
2778,3,10,Munky,Good idea.
2779,3,10,Eric Cartman,How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
2780,3,10,David,"We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll."
2781,3,10,Eric Cartman,"[holds the doll tight] Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!"
2782,3,10,Munky,"Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio."
2783,3,10,Fieldy,"My glasses gotta be around here somewhere. [a peg-legged pirate ghost appears next to him] Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses."
2784,3,10,Peg leg,Raaarrrgh!
2785,3,10,Fieldy,"Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?"
2786,3,10,Peg leg,Raarraarrgh! [canned laughter]
2787,3,10,Fieldy,"Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one! [more canned laughter]"
2788,3,10,Jonathan,"[from the other end of the room] Fieldy, what are you doing?!"
2789,3,10,Fieldy,"[turns to face him] Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a..."
2790,3,10,All,Puh-puuhh pirate ghost! [all scatter]
2791,3,10,Peg leg,Raaarrrgh!
2792,3,10,David,"Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas. [the camera now follows the trap as David describes it] When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them."
2793,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
2794,3,10,Munky,Hey! Somebody's coming. [everyone jumps back behind some boxes]
2795,3,10,Secure Group,Aaaaah!
2796,3,10,Stan Marsh,We've got to hide!
2797,3,10,Jonathan,"Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us. [calls out] Mr. Banderas!"
2798,3,10,David,"[peeks up] Jonathan, no!"
2799,3,10,Secure group,[hits the slick] Aaaah! [the trap works exactly as David said it would]
2800,3,10,Head,"Oh, no!"
2801,3,10,Secure group,Aaaah! [the cart hits the wall and stops. The insecure group rushes in]
2802,3,10,Stan Marsh,Ow!
2803,3,10,David,"Hold on, guys! [the lynch mob, led by the watchmen, bursts through the doors and moves in on the group]"
2804,3,10,Brunet,"Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town! [the pirate ghosts appear]"
2805,3,10,Pirate Ghosts,Aarrrrgh.
2806,3,10,Crowd,[frightened] Aaaaaah!
2807,3,10,Randy Marsh,KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
2808,3,10,Crowd,[shrieking] Aaaaaah!
2809,3,10,Jonathan,"[to his band mates] Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna have to use our special KoRn powers. [the five members huddle and link hands to forearms] KoRn powers, vitalize! [starbursts abound as each member transforms]"
2810,3,10,Munky,Munky!
2811,3,10,David,David!
2812,3,10,Fieldy,Fieldy!
2813,3,10,Head,Head!
2814,3,10,Jonathan,Jonathan!
2815,3,10,KoRn,"Form of... CORN! [final starbursts give way to various corn products: two corncobs, a tub of popcorn, a can of creamed corn, and one corn kernel. The tub of popcorn swells and spits out several popped kernels. The townsfolk just stare and the corn products stay still. The pirates are seen staring. Soon, the products revert to the band mates]"
2816,3,10,Jonathan,"Alright! Great job, gang! [The townsfolk stare]"
2817,3,10,Eric Cartman,That didn't help at all.
2818,3,10,Head,We know. It's just cool to do.
2819,3,10,Pirate Ghosts,Aarrrrgh!
2820,3,10,Nibblet,"[floating up to release the net] Nibblet! [releases the net, and it lands on the pirate ghosts]"
2821,3,10,KoRn,[grateful] Nibblet!
2822,3,10,Barbrady,What the hell is that thing??
2823,3,10,David,"You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!"
2824,3,10,Jonathan,"[approaches the net] Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are! [the ghosts disappear, and he throws his palms up] Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts."
2825,3,10,Barbrady,"[approaches with gun drawn] Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!"
2826,3,10,Nibblet,"[notices some twine hanging from two trap doors on the ceiling] Hehey, look what Nibblet sees. [pulls on the twine, and the doors open. Priest Maxi falls to the ground]"
2827,3,10,Priest Maxi,Whoa! [lands with a thud]
2828,3,10,Chef,What the...?
2829,3,10,Man,Father Maxi?
2830,3,10,Priest Maxi,"[gets up] Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band!"
2831,3,10,Barbrady,Oh?
2832,3,10,Jonathan,No! Arrest him!
2833,3,10,Mob,Huh??
2834,3,10,Jonathan,I think I've got this groovy mystery solved!
2835,3,10,Chef,"Well, I must say I still don't get this at all."
2836,3,10,Jonathan,"It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks."
2837,3,10,David,"Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts. [shows the flashlight and swabs, then shines the light through the swabs. The pirate ghosts appear in the distance]"
2838,3,10,Fieldy,[with some cheese and a cup] Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese. [holds them to his mouth and sounds] Aaaaraargh!
2839,3,10,Jonathan,"And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels. [genuflects to place the candle between the mirror and the squirrels. A pirate ship appears on the lake]"
2840,3,10,Chef,"Father, why did you go to all this trouble?"
2841,3,10,Priest Maxi,"Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!"
2842,3,10,Chef,Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
2843,3,10,Brunet,Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?
2844,3,10,Priest Maxi,No.
2845,3,10,Barbrady,"Okay buddy, you can explain downtown! [takes the priest away]"
2846,3,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!"
2847,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! Where's Grandma? [the dog walks in and begins regurgitating. First, the head comes out]"
2848,3,10,Mob,Eeewww! [the rest of the body comes out]
2849,3,10,Stan Marsh,There she is!
2850,3,10,Mob,Oooh!
2851,3,10,Man,Ho-hoh.
2852,3,10,Chef,"Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!"
2853,3,10,Sharon Marsh,Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
2854,3,10,Jonathan,"Well, sure. Why the heck not?"
2855,3,10,Mob,All right! [the pirate cutout is hoisted up on two poles]
2856,3,10,Pirate Voice,Raarrrr!
2857,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! [the cutout shakes and falls away, revealing Nibblet]"
2858,3,10,All,Nibblet!
2859,3,10,Nibblet,Uh oh!
2860,3,10,Jonathan,"Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive."
2861,3,10,All,[reflecting] Yeah.
2862,3,10,Jonathan,"The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:And a-one, and-a-two, and a [goes right into ""Falling Away From Me."" The strobe lights come on, and the crowd looks a little stunned. The fifth graders are at the very front of the crowd, and the body of Grandma Broflovski inches up to them]"
2863,3,10,Stan Marsh,Boo!
2864,3,10,Three Fifth Graders,Aaaah! [they run away]
2865,3,10,Stan Marsh,"Sweet! [Nibblet floats up to the Antonio Banderas blow-up doll and punctures it. It deflates, alerting Cartman]"
2866,3,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Sweet! [Nibblet floats up to the Antonio Banderas blow-up doll and punctures it. It deflates, alerting Cartman]"
2867,3,10,Eric Cartman,"Antonio, no! [sees Nibblet and goes after it] You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! [KoRn continues playing. At another part of the docks, Mr. Garrison holds court over the Halloween Costume Contest. Kenny is present]"
2868,3,10,Mr Garrison,"And the winner of the costume contest is [reads the name] Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy. [she rushes up and stands next to him]"
2869,3,10,Kenny McCormick,[droops] (Awww.)
2870,3,11,Mr. Kitty,Reowr.
2871,3,11,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!"
2872,3,11,Mr. Kitty,Reowr.
2873,3,11,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty! [the TV screen shows a blond Ash-like figure surrounded by three little monsters]"
2874,3,11,Ash,"Someday, I will collect all the Chinpokomon, then I will fight the Evil Power that will reveal itself once all the Chinpokomon are collectable, [tilts his head to one side] oh?"
2875,3,11,Mr. Kitty,Roar?
2876,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[affecting an anime look] No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?"
2877,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of... Chinpokomon.
2878,3,11,Eric Cartman,[exults] Hooray! [hops off the sofa and begins to walk away...]
2879,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,Hey kids! [Cartman turns to look at the TV] Do you love Chinpokomon?
2880,3,11,Eric Cartman,Yes.
2881,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,"Well, now you can buy your very own! [the little monsters begin to flash across the screen]"
2882,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,"I got to buy ChinpokomonI got to buy it, I got to buy it! [six Chinpokomon appear]"
2883,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,"[more Chinpokomon appear...] Now you can collect them all. Furrycat, Donkeytron, Pengin, Shoe, Lambtor. Collect them all, and you can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master."
2884,3,11,Eric Cartman,Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
2885,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,All the Chinpokomon are in stores now.
2886,3,11,Japanese Woman,"[dressed in business attire] Chinpokomon is soo-peh-rior rubbeh toy, Nuhmbah 1!"
2887,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,I got to buy it! Chinpo-ko-mon!
2888,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[turns off TV and rushes to the kitchen, tossing the chicken tenders away] Mom! Mom!"
2889,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[pants] Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!"
2890,3,11,Liane Cartman,"Eric, calm down. [genuflects and restrains him]"
2891,3,11,Eric Cartman,Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
2892,3,11,Liane Cartman,"What is it, Eric?"
2893,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[breathless] Muh-Mom, I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store."
2894,3,11,Liane Cartman,"[stands up and turns to the counter] I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric."
2895,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[stops] ...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool."
2896,3,11,Liane Cartman,"Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?"
2897,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[shriek] ...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!"
2898,3,11,Liane Cartman,Alright! let's go. [heads towards the front door. Cartman follows]
2899,3,11,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
2900,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. [Liane opens the door, and both are shocked to find the store full of kids looking around and walking with Chinpokomon dolls. The class is there...]"
2901,3,11,Butters,Wuh-I love Chinpokomon.
2902,3,11,Girl,[amid the din] Give it to me!
2903,3,11,Boy,Give it here!
2904,3,11,Boy,[fighting with Bradley Biggle over a Chinpokomon doll] Give me that!
2905,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, god damnit! [walks in and runs into Stan]"
2906,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Hey, fat ass."
2907,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too."
2908,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe."
2909,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest. [walks to the Pengin canister and finds it empty] God damnit, there's no more Pengins! [Kenny walks over with one] Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. [starts pulling]"
2910,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh uh.) [pulls back. Tug-of-war]
2911,3,11,Eric Cartman,C'mon.
2912,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh uh!)
2913,3,11,Eric Cartman,"C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--"
2914,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(No!)
2915,3,11,Eric Cartman,C'mon.
2916,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(No!)
2917,3,11,Eric Cartman,C'mon. Give me Pengin!
2918,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(No! This is mine!)
2919,3,11,Eric Cartman,C'mon!
2920,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things."
2921,3,11,Liane Cartman,They're so strange. Where are they from?
2922,3,11,Cashier,"Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids."
2923,3,11,Ash,"[on a TV screen] I've got to collect all Chinpokomon. I've got to collect them all so I can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master, oooh? [static]"
2924,3,11,Japanese woman,"Own-ah Chinpokomon, and-ah you vill-ah have-ah happy feelings-eh. [static]"
2925,3,11,Ash,I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
2926,3,11,Kids,[recite as they disperse] Must collect Chinpokomon.
2927,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin."
2928,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck you!)
2929,3,11,Eric Cartman,"God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!"
2930,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[arrives] Hey dudes. [notices] What are those?
2931,3,11,Stan Marsh,What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
2932,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
2933,3,11,Eric Cartman,[haltingly] You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.
2934,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll."
2935,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday."
2936,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, like ancient history."
2937,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
2938,3,11,Stan Marsh,"No, dude!"
2939,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle."
2940,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
2941,3,11,Eric Cartman,It's all Chinpokomon now.
2942,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective."
2943,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,What's the Primary Main Objective?
2944,3,11,Eric Cartman,You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
2945,3,11,Stan Marsh,The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
2946,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what's the Evil Power?"
2947,3,11,Stan Marsh,[exasperated] Ogh..!
2948,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[exasperated] Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!"
2949,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2950,3,11,Eric Cartman,Duhhh!
2951,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, get with the times, dude. [turns and walks away with Cartman and Kenny]"
2952,3,11,Eric Cartman,Duhhh!
2953,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[throws down Cyborg Bill] Shit!
2954,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I guess so."
2955,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters] Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?"
2956,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,What's a Chinpokomon?
2957,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not sure.
2958,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, why do you need one?"
2959,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
2960,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll."
2961,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon."
2962,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something."
2963,3,11,Ike Broflovski,Neah Kyle doh.
2964,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"You see, son, fads come and go. And this ""Chin-po-ko-mon"" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, ""I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual."" Do you understand?"
2965,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass."
2966,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,Hm... Good point; here's $10. [hands it to him]
2967,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks.
2968,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. [Kyle receives the other $10 and walks out]"
2969,3,11,Ike Broflovski,"Hey, Chih-paw-ko."
2970,3,11,Cashier,"[hands him the doll] There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things."
2971,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Neither do I. [turns and walks out.]
2972,3,11,Cashier,[closes the door and turns off the lights] I guess I'll call it a night. [heads towards the back]
2973,3,11,A voice,"Chinpoko! [the cashier turns] Buy me! Buy me! [the cashier heads for the Chinpokomon display] When will you become Royal Chinpoko Master? [the cashier gets a Lambtor and squeezes it, making a little squeak.] Hurry up and buy me. [squeeze] Down with America!"
2974,3,11,Cashier,What? [squeeze]
2975,3,11,Lambtron,"I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government."
2976,3,11,Cashier,What the hell is goin' on here?
2977,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[enters] Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
2978,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week."

2980,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?"
2981,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[a little lost] Huh? No.
2982,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[haltingly] Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! [Cartman presses ""START"" on game controller]"
2983,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,"Chinpokomon, what is Primary Objective?"
2984,3,11,Stan Kenny Cartman,To destroy the Evil Power!
2985,3,11,Ash,"I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh?"
2986,3,11,Stan Kenny Cartman,Oooh?
2987,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Damnit! [walks out]
2988,3,11,Ash,"I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor."
2989,3,11,Japanese woman,[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! Deddy? [vanishes]
2990,3,11,Ash,"Go! [""GO"" pops up, and the boys are furiously maneuvering their controllers]"

2992,3,11,Ash,I must buy them all! I must buy them all!
2993,3,11,Stan Kenny Cartman,We must buy them all! [they finish the first round of bombing and fly away]
2994,3,11,Japanese woman,[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! [drops down. The second round begins and the bombing is more intense. Kenny begins to convulse and finally drops off the sofa. Play stops as Cartman and Stan look on with shock]
2995,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!"
2996,3,11,Eric Cartman,Cool! This game rules!
2997,3,11,Cashier,"Hello-o? Ey, hello? [a monitor drops down from above]"

3002,3,11,Taller man,"I am President Hirohito. And-ah, this is Mr. Ose."
3003,3,11,Mr Ose,[nods forward] Peased to meet you.
3004,3,11,President Hirohito,We unduhstand you have big concern about our fine pro-duct.
3005,3,11,Red Harris,"Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about? [squeezes Lambtor]"

3009,3,11,President Hirohito,"That is so sturange. [takes Lambtor from Red] I do not a-know how this could happen. But urest assured, I will make sure [glares sideways at Mr. Ose] it does not happong again!"

3011,3,11,President Hirohito,You are American?
3012,3,11,Red Harris,Yes.
3013,3,11,President Hirohito,[begins to gesture] Ogh! You must have very big pee-anis!
3014,3,11,Red Harris,Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
3015,3,11,President Hirohito,Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.
3016,3,11,Mr Ose,"[fakes a sob] Uh, smuh, so small."
3017,3,11,President Hirohito,We cannot achieve much with so small penis. But you! Americans. Wow! Penis so big! Soo big penis!
3018,3,11,Red Harris,"[flattered] Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size."
3019,3,11,Mr Ose,"Minata, kite kite! [""Everone, come come!"" A group of Japanese women move in, chattering] This-a man has veh-ry big penis! [the women applaud, Red grins big]"

3023,3,11,Red Harris,"Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now."
3024,3,11,President Hirohito,"Good-bye. Thank you for stopping by, with your gargantuan penis. [Red walks out humming happily. After a moment Hirohito looks angrily at Mr. Ose] Dame, dame da. [""Bad, this is bad."" The women move away quickly. He slaps Mr. Ose] Naze kono chippu wa soto ni detandaba? [""How could you let this chip go out?""]"
3025,3,11,Mr Ose,"Wa, wakarimasen, sachoo san. Mondai desu nee. [""I, I don't know, boss. That's the problem.""]"

3027,3,11,Mr Ose,"Hai. Hai, sachoo san. [""Yes. Yes, boss."" He bows out]"
3028,3,11,Eric Cartman,I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
3029,3,11,President Hirohito,"Amerika ni, kodomo zenbu Chinpokomon motte iru. Kore kara, ""phase two"" hajimete. IKIMASHOO! [""All the children in America own Chinpokomon. We'll begin ""phase two"" there. LET'S GO!"" The soldiers set their rifles] The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!"
3030,3,11,Randy Marsh,[walks up] What are you doing?
3031,3,11,Sharon Marsh,I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
3032,3,11,Randy Marsh,Why?
3033,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. [Randy sits]"
3034,3,11,Ash,"[addressing a robot rooster] Hey, you must be Roostor! I haven't bought one of you yet, but I'll bet you can transform into Roostallion if you found Diamond Skill 7! [picks it up and squeezes]"
3035,3,11,Roostor,Roo-oo-oostor! [a teen boy in black body suit emblazoned with an 8 appear]
3036,3,11,Eight,"[does the following as he speaks] Hey, I'm gonna take your Roostor and put it in this bag, where it will flourish or expire, depending on fate!"
3037,3,11,Ash,Hey! Is that a good idea?
3038,3,11,Eight,Roostors aren't like Chuchunezumis. They haven't the heart for such endeavors.
3039,3,11,Ash,Oooh? [Randy and Sharon look lost]
3040,3,11,Randy Marsh,...Are those good moral values?
3041,3,11,Sharon Marsh,I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
3042,3,11,Ash,Lambtron! You are losing the battle of your life! [Lambtron battles Furrycat]
3043,3,11,Narrator,But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?
3044,3,11,Ash,"I am sad now, because Lambtron must be very lonely because there are so few Lambtrons in the world. Will he ever find a companion?"
3045,3,11,Sharon Marsh,This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
3046,3,11,Randy Marsh,"I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all."
3047,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!"
3048,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent."
3049,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation."
3050,3,11,Randy Marsh,"[solemnly] My God, you're right."
3051,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and..."
3052,3,11,Stan Marsh,"[arrives with Kenny] How's it goin', fat ass?"
3053,3,11,Eric Cartman,I haven't made any money yet.
3054,3,11,Stan Marsh,What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
3055,3,11,Eric Cartman,Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
3056,3,11,Stan Marsh,We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. [moves Kenny so the glazed eyes can be seen]
3057,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes up with a new item] I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! [Tthe others look at him and then laugh]
3058,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!"
3059,3,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
3060,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Camp?
3061,3,11,Eric Cartman,[sighs] The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
3062,3,11,Stan Marsh,You didn't know that?
3063,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[quickly saving face] No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? [turns and walks away]"
3064,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""?"
3065,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns back] Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?"
3066,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!"
3067,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore."
3068,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?"
3069,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Like, eight days ago."
3070,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,God damnit! [turns and hurries away]
3071,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,"Hey, kids! [Furrycat appears] Only one more day till the Chinpokomon camp! [""Ash"" and ""Eight"" appear] Come early and enjoy all the Chinpoko fun! [""Chinpokomon CAMP"" is placed over Furrycat, then a violet gorilla appears]"
3072,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,Chinpokomon Camp!I've got to buy a ticket!I've got to buy one! A ticket!I've got to buy buy buy!
3073,3,11,Japanese woman,[pops in from the side] It'sa Satuhday anda Sunday. You can'ta wait to go! [moves out]
3074,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,Chinpokomon! [the TV clicks off]
3075,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel."
3076,3,11,Liane Cartman,"Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad."
3077,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did."
3078,3,11,Randy Marsh,"[concerned] Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys."
3079,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them."
3080,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it."
3081,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?"
3082,3,11,Eric Cartman,Get outta the way! Move it!
3083,3,11,Stan Marsh,Can you see anything? [the gorilla Chinpokomon appears onscreen]
3084,3,11,Kids,Yay!!! [applause]

3118,3,11,Mr Garrison,Aggghhh! [rushes out of the room amid the kids' laughter]
3119,3,11,Mayor McDaniels,"People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying..."
3120,3,11,Mr Garrison,"I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp."
3121,3,11,Sharon Marsh,[Randy holds her] My son hasn't made any sense in days.
3122,3,11,Priest Maxi,"I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!"
3123,3,11,Mayor McDaniels,"Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? [Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose step up]"
3124,3,11,President Hirohito,We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.
3125,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!"
3126,3,11,President Hirohito,There is nothing to worry about. We at Japan Toy Company are in awe of your large penis.
3127,3,11,Mr Garrison,What?
3128,3,11,President Hirohito,"You see, Japanese penis so small. [holds his hands about an inch apart]"
3129,3,11,Mr Ose,[set his index finger an inch from his thumb] So-eh small.

3131,3,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, uh-I guess that's true."

3133,3,11,President Hirohito,"What can we possubruh do with such small penis? We cannot take over your city, filled witha men awith such mastodonic penis."
3134,3,11,Jimbo,"Huwell, uh he's got a point there."
3135,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, I guess that settles that."
3136,3,11,Priest Maxi,"We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen."
3137,3,11,President Hirohito,"[bowing with Mr. Ose] Oh, no. Thank you. Another chance to be in same room with big American penis. [exits]"

3143,3,11,Liane Cartman,You have?
3144,3,11,Mayor McDaniels,Children are fickle. [thump] All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
3145,3,11,Sharon Marsh,Of course! That's a great idea!
3146,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,But what toy?

3193,3,11,Sharon Marsh,Stanley--
3194,3,11,Kids,Beikoku!
3195,3,11,Sharon Marsh,--you need to come home right now.
3196,3,11,Mr Ose,Owatta!
3197,3,11,Kids,Beikoku!
3198,3,11,Sharon Marsh,Mommy misses you.
3199,3,11,Mr Ose,Owatta!
3200,3,11,Kids,Beikoku!
3201,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, I'm talking to you!"
3202,3,11,Mr Ose,Owatta!
3203,3,11,Kids,"Beikoku! [Sharon steps in and takes Stan's hand. The troops gather round, forcing her back] Huhhh?"
3204,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"[pleading] Stan, please, come home!"
3205,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Kore wa watashi no uchi desu. [""This is my home now.""]"
3206,3,11,Kids,"So desu née. [""That's right.""]"
3207,3,11,Mr Ose,Ooh? [resumes his position. Sharon looks betrayed] Do not worry. Everything isa okay.
3208,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"No, it's not okay!"
3209,3,11,Mr Ose,"Oh, but-a you have-a such large penis-uh. [behind him, Stan has a fierce expression on his face]"
3210,3,11,Sharon Marsh,What?
3211,3,11,Mr Ose,"Your penis, wooww-- [President Hirohito walks up and slaps him] O-oh..!"
3212,3,11,President Hirohito,What he means is that all men in this town have very large penis. [all the men smile at the compliment]
3213,3,11,Sharon Marsh,Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
3214,3,11,President Hirohito,"Misenasai! [""Show them!"" Mr. Ose takes down his pants. The people are shocked, and he pulls them up again.]"
3215,3,11,Sharon Marsh,Oh! [the march resumes]
3216,3,11,Mr Ose,Owatta!
3217,3,11,Kids,Beikoku!
3218,3,11,Mr Ose,Owatta!
3219,3,11,Kids,Beikoku!
3220,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh God, is there nothing we can do?"
3221,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"[turns to face the adults] Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon! [the last of the troops leaves]"
3222,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,How?
3223,3,11,Sharon Marsh,Come on! We don't have much time! [leads the adults away]
3224,3,11,Reporter,"And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States."
3225,3,11,President Bill Clinton,"[from the Oval Office] My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you."
3226,3,11,Mr Ose,Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!
3227,3,11,Kids,"Hai, sachoo-san. [""Yes, Mr. President."" The kids part to the planes. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny run into the adults]"
3228,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Nan da kore? [""What's this?""]"
3229,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! [""We're crazy about this Chinpoko stuff."" All the adults carry Chinpokomon now]"
3230,3,11,Stan Marsh,What?
3231,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!"
3232,3,11,Stan Marsh,You like it?
3233,3,11,Mr Garrison,You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
3234,3,11,Liane Cartman,"Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron."
3235,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Uh... no, that's okay, Mom."
3236,3,11,President Hirohito,Whar are they doing?!
3237,3,11,Mr Ose,It's a trick!
3238,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker. [""MY KID IS A CHINPOKOKID"" with a smiling kid's face on the left end, and a Lambtron on the right. Randy walks to it and kneels to display it] Isn't that cool?"
3239,3,11,Stan Marsh,"[holding a Chuchunezumi] No. [the adults laugh, and he throws the Chuchunezumi away] Screw this, dude. [starts walking out]"
3240,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Where are you going, Stan?"
3241,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. [walks away]"
3242,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. [follows]"
3243,3,11,Other kids,Yeah. Me too! Me too. [each one tosses a Chinpokomon onto a pile and leaves the airfield. A Lambtron lands on its side and a kid steps on it. The adults cheer.]
3244,3,11,President Hirohito,[grabbing his head in frustrated disbelief] Nooo!!
3245,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves."
3246,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool. [turns to Mr. Garrison] We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! [he walks over to a telegraph machine and starts spreading the word]"
3247,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?"
3248,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"You bet, Stanley! [a fighter plane has left its spot and appears before the crowd. Kyle is in the cockpit]"
3249,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Owatta Beikoku! [the adults are stunned]
3250,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, it's over!"
3251,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
3252,3,11,Stan Marsh,"[flatly] Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore."
3253,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?
3254,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, dude, that's way over. [a rat is on Kenny, trying to nibble]"
3255,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!"
3256,3,11,Stan Marsh,"No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused."
3257,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
3258,3,11,Stan Marsh,...Ye-eah.
3259,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. [moves forward]"
3260,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh... Wait. [walks with the plane] Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes."
3261,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. [turns the power off and hops out of the plane. Mr. Garrison walk away]"
3262,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over."
3263,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[sees rats on Kenny and swats them off] Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!"
3264,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!"
3265,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?"
3266,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while."
3267,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Me, too. [Kenny starts to tremble] I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- [Kenny falls and trembles harder. The others watch]"
3268,3,11,Stan Marsh,What the..? [Kenny's body rips open and a bunch of rats crawl out of him.]
3269,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! [Stan and Kyle laugh as Cartman looks on, the credits play the instrumental theme that played in the Wild Wacky Action Bike & Alabama Man commercials]"
3270,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,(over the Braniff Airlines logo) Bye bye buh-buh-buh-buh-buh chicken!
3271,3,12,Liane Cartman,"[sets the box down on the floor] Eric, Mommy got you a present!"
3272,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[suddenly excited] A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!"
3273,3,12,Liane Cartman,"Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow."
3274,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[drops and sighs heavily] Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do."
3275,3,12,Liane Cartman,"This year is gonna be different. Look! [places the box on the table] I got you ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics."" [mom and son look at each other]"
3276,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[after a while] What the hell is ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"""
3277,3,12,Liane Cartman,"It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee. [unpacks the contents: two cassette tapes, a tiny drum set, an owner's manual, and a live monkey. The monkey chatters] It says we just put the cassette into a tape player [does it, and presses the Play button. A glissant plays, and the monkey sits behind the drum set]"
3278,3,12,Hooked On Monkey Fonics Female Voice,"Welcome to ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics,"" level 1. I will read the sounds and the monkey will help keep the beat. [Liane smiles] If your monkey arrived in the box dead, call 1-800-555-4500 to get a new monkey. Ready? Let's begin. [glissant. The monkey plays. A little rap follows]The learning monkey is here to sayThat reading is easy and it's okay.[Liane starts swaying like a metronome]Work with the monkey and you will learnTo spell hard words, like ""morbid"" and ""burn.""Start with Card 1. [Liane holds it up] Ready? Begin! [glissant] C, H. [a ""ch"" sound] Chalk. [the monkey plays four beats more, then turns to Cartman. One more beat...]"
3279,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[finally responds, keeping the beat] C, H. ""Ch."" Chalk."
3280,3,12,Hooked On Monkey Fonics Female Voice,"Good. Card 2. [Liane holds it up] T, H. [a hard ""th""] There."
3281,3,12,Eric Cartman,"T, H. ""Th."" There. Hey, this is easy! [raps] I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!"
3282,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals! [the crowd cheers. The Mayor walks over and stands next to Mr. Mackey. The new boy is gone!] This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary."
3283,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks."
3284,3,12,Gerald Broflovski,You bet money on my son to win?!
3285,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew."
3286,3,12,Eric Cartman,"You're going down, bitch!"
3287,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you."
3288,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! [signals something with a thumbs-up. The monkey and drums are next to him, on the floor.]"
3289,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! [they enter...]"
3290,3,12,Jimbo Kern,What?! [...and take their seats]
3291,3,12,Eric Cartman,Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
3292,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!"
3293,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What's a ""home-schooled kid""?"
3294,3,12,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. [the left side of the groups is shown. Mark, the new kid seen earlier, sits next to Token, and Rebecca takes the aisle seat. The others in their section study them.]"
3295,3,12,The Cotswolds,"[cheering] Go, Mark! Go, Rebecca!"
3296,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"[reads, then] Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school. [he steps on the platform] All right, Mark. Your word is ""conscientious."""
3297,3,12,Eric Cartman,What?! What the fuck that that mean?
3298,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"""Conscientious."" May I have the definition, please?"
3299,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Closely attentive to details. Careful.
3300,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"""Conscientious."" Could you use it in a sentence, please?"
3301,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.
3302,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"""Conscientious."" C O N S C I E N T I O U S."
3303,3,12,Eric Cartman,[as the bell rings] Holy crap! [the crowd is stunned]
3304,3,12,The Cotswolds,"Way to go, Mark! Alright!"
3305,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman. [he goes to the platform, smiling] Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. [he looks to the monkey, who's minding its own business]"
3306,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum! [it looks around] Come on! [it begins to drum something else, getting excited. Cartman looks resigned]"
3307,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Eric, your word is ""chair."""
3308,3,12,Eric Cartman,Uuh. Definition?
3309,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Something you sit on.
3310,3,12,Eric Cartman,Country of origin?
3311,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"English! [the angrier she gets, the more afraid Mr. Mackey looks]"
3312,3,12,Eric Cartman,Could you please use it in a sentence?
3313,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is ""chair""!!"
3314,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Uh- chair. C H A R E [the buzzer sounds and Eric panics] God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?! [races off the stage] Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!"
3315,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school. [Rebecca takes the platform, but casts her eyes down and away from the mayor. She nervously taps her hands together] Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral."
3316,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[voice quivering] ""Litoral."" Deh-finition?"
3317,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Having to do with a lake or ocean.
3318,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"""Litoral."" Will you please use it in a sentence?"
3319,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
3320,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"""Littoral."" [Before saying each letter, she opens her hands like a book, whispers the letter into them, and closes them] L I T O R A L"
3321,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,[sounding the little bell] Correct!
3322,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] Wow! [he's impressed]
3323,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"[both parents clap] Alright, Rebecca. Good job, honey. [she takes her seat]"
3324,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Now we have Kyle Broflovski. [he takes the platform] Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
3325,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,What??
3326,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Krocsyldiphithic.
3327,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Definition?
3328,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
3329,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, could you use it in a sentence?"
3330,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Certainly. ""Krocsyldiphithic"" is a hard word to spell."
3331,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"""Krocsyldiphic."""
3332,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"You can do it, kid! You can do it!"
3333,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"""Krocsyldiphic."" C [the buzzer cuts him off] Damnit!"
3334,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks. [Stuart, Gerald, Randy, and Ned start carrying him away] Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!"
3335,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca. [hand them their trophies] You are truly South Park's finest. [a print photographer takes a picture]"
3336,3,12,Stan Marsh,"[standing before the stage with Cartman and Kenny] Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart."
3337,3,12,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. [the finalists come off the stage and stand in front of it.]
3338,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to Rebecca] What's your name? [apparently, he wasn't paying attention...]"
3339,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Guh what's in a name? [turns and walks away]
3340,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Wooww.
3341,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
3342,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[mocking] Oh, yes. We must do it again."
3343,3,12,Stan Marsh,We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
3344,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"No. I live right over there. [points to a house like any other, but it has bars on its windows] I've lived there all my life."
3345,3,12,Eric Cartman,How come you don't go to school?
3346,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Because I'm home-schooled.
3347,3,12,Stan Marsh,What's that?
3348,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
3349,3,12,Eric Cartman,You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
3350,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Right.
3351,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[waxes poetic]Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?"
3352,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman?"
3353,3,12,Eric Cartman,"You shut up, [backhand slap] butthole."
3354,3,12,Stan Marsh,"You shut up, [backhand slap] gaywad!"
3355,3,12,Eric Cartman,"You shut up, [backhand slap] ass-logger!"
3356,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[astonished] Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?"
3357,3,12,Stan Marsh,"No, we're friends."
3358,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Strange, friends would call each other names and fight."
3359,3,12,Stan Marsh,What?
3360,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel. [the family walks away. Kyle looks after Rebecca. Mark looks back at the boys.]"
3361,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos."
3362,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Papa?
3363,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Yes, Mark?"
3364,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
3365,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,[gasps] Oooh.
3366,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"[leans in on Mark] Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!"
3367,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá."
3368,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,"Mark, you have play time. You get to play in the afternoon."
3369,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like."
3370,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it."
3371,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days."
3372,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!"
3373,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Hooray!
3374,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?"
3375,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[voice quivering] Oh, heavens, no."
3376,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe! [the doorbell rings and all look towards it]"
3377,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[Mrs. Cotswolds opens the door] Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?"
3378,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,Yes she is. [doesn't move]
3379,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"...Uuh, can I talk to her?"
3380,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,"Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca! [Rebecca walks up] This little boy wants to see you."
3381,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[with hands in prayer pose] Huhlo? [Kyle looks a little dismayed, as her tapping of hands is a habit. He looks at her mom for any assistance, but sees none. He looks at Rebecca again]"
3382,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"U-u-uh, hi. [puts his hands behind his back]"
3383,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Hel-lo.
3384,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. [turns and hurries away. Rebecca looks, then goes in. Her mom closes the door]"
3385,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,[walks up] Who was that?
3386,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.
3387,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,[wary] Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
3388,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,"But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children."
3389,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close! [they then stand motionless for a while]"
3390,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? [A large plastic ball rolls into class, and Mark is inside driving it. He runs into Craig's chair and stops.]"
3391,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Hey, guys. What's up?"
3392,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?"
3393,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America? [Mark and Cartman vie to answer] Ehyes, Mark?"
3394,3,12,Eric Cartman,Ey! How come you never pick me?!
3395,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?"
3396,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade."
3397,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!"
3398,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. [every kid looks angrily at Mark.]"
3399,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground."
3400,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from? [again, Mark and Cartman vie to answer] Put your hand down, creampuff."
3401,3,12,Eric Cartman,That does it! [gets off his seat and moves towards the door] I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
3402,3,12,Stan Marsh,"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass."
3403,3,12,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! [leaves and closes the door]"
3404,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, please God, let it be forever."
3405,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me."""
3406,3,12,Pip Pirrup,"But, if I say that, you'll hit me."
3407,3,12,Stan Marsh,"No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you."
3408,3,12,Pip Pirrup,"Please, hit me."
3409,3,12,Stan Marsh,All right. [backhand slap]
3410,3,12,Pip Pirrup,Ooowww!
3411,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip."
3412,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[rolls up] I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. [Craig and Butters walk up]"
3413,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball."
3414,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
3415,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. [moves out of the way as Craig and Butters position the ball]"
3416,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench."
3417,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
3418,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!"
3419,3,12,Boys,"Okay, let's get him... [more chatter as they place him on the bench and duct-tape him to it]"
3420,3,12,Butters Stotch,Got it. [the boys disperse]
3421,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!"
3422,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!"
3423,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Oh, dear."
3424,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now."
3425,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,I'm sure he's alright.
3426,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"[a thump on the door] That must be him. [thump. Mr. Cotswolds opens the door, and both parents look]"
3427,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,Waaaaah! [Mark has walked home still strapped to the bench]
3428,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Oh my God, son!"
3429,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. [walks in]"
3430,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Mark, what have they done to you?!"
3431,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Well, they duct-taped me to a bench."
3432,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,But why?
3433,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all."
3434,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!"
3435,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"But I want to go back tomorrow, papá."
3436,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,What??
3437,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Please, just give me one more day. [walks off]"
3438,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,What do we do?
3439,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers. [snort, snort. He seems to have a little problem with phlegm in the nose]"
3440,3,12,A voice,"[with guitar]Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you, Rebecca.[she stops writing and looks to the window]I don't know what to do, Rebecca.[she hops off the chair, walks over to her toy box and hops onto it]You're so nice, I'd like to get to know you better.[she looks out the window. It is Kyle she sees]So what do you say we get together?You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!Rebecca, you're really quite good-looking!You're a fox.[she looks a bit more, then moves away from the window. Kyle waits, then brightens as she returns. She drops some money down to him, and it lands in the guitar case. She moves away again, and he looks at the money]"
3441,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments. [the other men turn to face him] My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy. [sniff]"
3442,3,12,Randy Marsh,"Uh, look, Mr...."
3443,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,Cotswolds.
3444,3,12,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own."
3445,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better. [the men get mad. He coughs, then points to Gerald] And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop."
3446,3,12,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff."
3447,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?"
3448,3,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once."
3449,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!"
3450,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?"
3451,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers."
3452,3,12,Jimbo Kern,You what??
3453,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"See ya, Cotswolds. [Randy looks and grins] Thanks for stopping by."
3454,3,12,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah. See ya. [the camera pans down to show Mr. Cotswolds duct-taped to a bench]
3455,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
3456,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,[walks up] Can I sit here with you?
3457,3,12,Stan Marsh,"[tsk] Aw, man, if you have to."
3458,3,12,Principal Victoria,"[over the P.A.] Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early."
3459,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
3460,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. [laughs]"
3461,3,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)"
3462,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
3463,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff."
3464,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place."
3465,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,What??
3466,3,12,Craig Tucker,"[leading a group of boys, walks up] Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?"
3467,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[confidently] Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me."
3468,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Ah, dude, you don't say that."
3469,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Huh?
3470,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Get him! [the group grabs him and duct-tapes him to an adjacent bench, then walks away.]"
3471,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school."
3472,3,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
3473,3,12,Eric Cartman,[sighing drowsily] Eeehhh.
3474,3,12,Announcer,Welcome to Huntin' and Killin' with Jimbo and Ned.
3475,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Eehh, shut up. [stretches] Ooohhh, yeasss."
3476,3,12,Liane Cartman,"[opens the door] Hon, are you ready for some math problems?"
3477,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door."
3478,3,12,Liane Cartman,"Oh, all right. [sets them on the nightstand]"
3479,3,12,Eric Cartman,Mom?
3480,3,12,Liane Cartman,Yes?
3481,3,12,Eric Cartman,Could you turn up the heat just a little?
3482,3,12,Liane Cartman,"Sure, hon. [turns it up and walks out]"
3483,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules. [turns to his right side] Yeeehhhhhhss! [goes to sleep.]"
3484,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Oh, hel-lo."
3485,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,"
3486,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?"
3487,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
3488,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Woowould you like to come up to my room?
3489,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Uuuh, okay. [she yanks him in] Gah!"
3490,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school."
3491,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?"
3492,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise."
3493,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Alright. [starts to shuffle away]
3494,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Mark, where's your sister?"
3495,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
3496,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Oh, alright."
3497,3,12,Both parents,What?! [they dash to her room]
3498,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo!
3499,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Rebecca, don't play that perverted game! [reaches the door and opens it. Before them is Kyle on his back on a low table covered by a blanket. Rebecca, in scrubs, stands on a chair cutting away at Kyle's hat. Both look at her parents]"
3500,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses."
3501,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling! [snorts twice and leaves with his wife]
3502,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go."
3503,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[voice quivering] Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go."
3504,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,You will?
3505,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,[voice quivering] I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.
3506,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No no. I mean, go with me."
3507,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride. [walks off to her home-schooling. Kyle gets mad and bangs his head against her chair]"
3508,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Ahhhhhhhhh. [""Jesus and Pals"" is heard in the background] Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired."
3509,3,12,Liane Cartman,"[opens the door] Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs."
3510,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. [sighs]"
3511,3,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, please. We have to do some studying today."
3512,3,12,Eric Cartman,"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. [she looks over and sees the Fonics Monkey tossing a box of Snacky S'mores around. She withdraws and Cartman yawns again. Stan and Kenny enter]"
3513,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?"
3514,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[sleepily] Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys."
3515,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, get your ass out of bed! [Kenny walks off] We have to go deal with that home-school kid!"
3516,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Huh, I can't. I'm too tired. [moves to sleep again] Maybe tomorrow."
3517,3,12,Kenny McCormick,"[to the monkey] (Hey, can I have that?) [reaches for a Snacky S'more in the monkey's hand, but the monkey tosses it away] (Heey.)"
3518,3,12,Stan Marsh,But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
3519,3,12,Eric Cartman,[sleepily] That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
3520,3,12,Kenny McCormick,"[smacked against a nightstand by the monkey] (Hey!) [the monkey starts tossing him around like a box] (Hey, Cartman, help me.)"
3521,3,12,Eric Cartman,"No, Fonics Monkey! [the monkey throws Kenny up against the ceiling and stomps on him] No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! [the monkey smashes Kenny against the foot of Cartman's bed several times, then stomps on him until he no longer responds]"
3522,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!"
3523,3,12,Eric Cartman,"You're damn straight, he did."
3524,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,You got my note?
3525,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,[voice quivering] Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?
3526,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, can we sit down?"
3527,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Wha-y noh-ot? [leads him onto a nice path next to a lovely flowerbed with all sorts of flora] Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it. [picks a flower]
3528,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that... [draws close] flicker of light over there?"
3529,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"I... [looks down and away, pulls away a bit] have looked at it."
3530,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children, [draws close] just like us."
3531,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
3532,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light. [they walk over to a stone bench and sit] Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study"
3533,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Well, what else would one do?"
3534,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Love, for one thing."
3535,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,And woowhat is love?
3536,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss."
3537,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Woowhat means ""ki-iss""?"
3538,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
3539,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me."
3540,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Rebecca, in public school, [hops down] we select our... own mate. [walks off a bit] In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy."
3541,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss. [he turns to face her] So I cold write about it. [Kyle walks back and sits on the bench] How do we do it?"
3542,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not completely sure.
3543,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Should we... [looks at him] l-look it up?
3544,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. [she hums as they get closer and closer. Their lips touch. A quick kiss and they pull apart]"
3545,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Wow. Wow, that was fun! [grabs him]"
3546,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dah. [she kisses him back, then lets go] Does that mean you'll go to the dance?"
3547,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.
3548,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole."
3549,3,12,Stan Marsh,Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
3550,3,12,Craig Tucker,"That's the point, buttpipe."
3551,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!"
3552,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape."
3553,3,12,Boys,Hooray! [they walk away]
3554,3,12,Bill,Hooray. [catches up to the others]
3555,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"[arrives with a group of men] Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. [Randy, Gerald, Ned, and Stuart are also present]"
3556,3,12,Randy Marsh,"Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?"
3557,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
3558,3,12,Gerald Broflovski,The flagpole! That's great! [Mr. Tweek and Craig's father are now present]
3559,3,12,Jimbo Kern,Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
3560,3,12,Men,[walk away] Alright!
3561,3,12,Stan Marsh,"[sees Kyle enter and walks to him] Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? [with him are Craig, Butters, and Cartman.]"
3562,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,[with a bouquet of flowers] I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
3563,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, brother! [shows his displeasure to the others]"
3564,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!"
3565,3,12,Stan Marsh,"You suck now, Kyle! [walks away with the other boys]"
3566,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,You suck!
3567,3,12,Principal Victoria,"[on stage] Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! [walks off as the curtains part. Dio appears with his band. The kids look back and say nothing]"
3568,3,12,Ronnie James Dio and Band,"Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?! [silence] I said, are you ready to rock?!"
3569,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess."
3570,3,12,Ronnie James Dio and Band,"Then let's hit it! [the band begins to play] I know you all remember this one. It's off my first solo album. The song that you all helped me make number 1.Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.Oh, what's-"
3571,3,12,Craig Tucker,"[""-becoming of me?""] Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid! [Mark enters and stands next to Kyle] Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! [""Ride the tiger.""]"
3572,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? [""You can see his stripes but you know he's clean.""]"
3573,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[dressed as a slut] Hi, guys. [""Oh, don't you see what I mean?"" She walks up to Butters, kisses him, and walks away]"
3574,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Woo-oh Holy Cow! [Kyle and Mark are quite surprised. ""Gotta get away.""]"
3575,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[walks over to Token] He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay? [grabs his ass and walks off]"
3576,3,12,Token Black,"What the-? Damn, baby. [rubs his ass. Red looks angrily at Rebecca. Kyle is shocked, and Mark has left]"
3577,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[walks over to Kyle] Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?"
3578,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Rebecca. You...
3579,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[returns] Rebecca, what the devil are you doing? [Pip walks by]"
3580,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"I'm... having... fun, Mark. [reels Pip back and kisses him]"
3581,3,12,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, my goodness! [hurries off]"
3582,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,You're out of control. [turns to Kyle] You did this to my sister!
3583,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Uh. All I did was show her how to-
3584,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! [leaps at him and slaps him around. The kids gather around to watch the fight, and Dio plays on. Mark throws Kyle into the air]"
3585,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,[landing on his back] Aaaah!
3586,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,[pounces on again] You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! [slaps him around some more]
3587,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Ooww!
3588,3,12,Craig Tucker,Oh my God!
3589,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!"
3590,3,12,Butters Stotch,Yeah. He's a badass! [smiles]
3591,3,12,Randy Marsh,"[entering] Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. [takes Kyle with him]"
3592,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"...I'm not through with you, bitch! [Stan walks up]"
3593,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. [Butters walks up]"
3594,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too."
3595,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? [Craig walks up]"
3596,3,12,Craig Tucker,[grabbing Mark's right hand] No! He's my friend!
3597,3,12,Butters Stotch,"[grabbing Mark's left hand] Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! [Mark smiles, pleased that these guys would fight for his friendship]"
3598,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,[enters another door with his wife] They've got to be here somewhere.
3599,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
3600,3,12,Men,Yeah! [move forward. Mr. Cotswolds goes to some outlet and unplugs the sound system. Dio stops playing]
3601,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
3602,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[onstage, takes the mic from Dio] Calm down, papá! [Papá looks at Mom] Everything is all right. [the kids look at him] You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on. [his parents listen] Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. [Rebecca is listening]"
3603,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Well, she sure is."
3604,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. The men listen]"
3605,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Mark. You're absolutely right. [Mark grins. His mom grins as well] Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school."
3606,3,12,Kids,Alright! [Rebecca goes up to Kyle and kisses him]
3607,3,12,Stan Marsh,"[goes onstage] Nice speech, nerdo."
3608,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Thanks, gaywad. [Cartman joins them]"
3609,3,12,Eric Cartman,Now you're gettin' it.
3610,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!"
3611,3,12,Men,Hooray!
3612,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,What?! [the men hoist him up and carry him out the doors]
3613,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"See ya, papá! [Dio takes the mic back]"
3614,3,12,Ronnie James Dio and Band,"Well, I'm glad we all learned something today, kids. Now, let's dance! [resumes with ""Holy Diver."" The Fonics Monkey is drumming with the band. Mr. Cotswolds is now duct-taped to the flagpole]"
3615,3,13,The Marklar,"Marklar, this is Marklar. Approaching Marklar."
3616,3,13,Marklar dispatcher,Proceed with marklar and make first contact.
3617,3,13,The Marklar,"Marklar. [the Marklar ship descends to Earth and hovers over a desert. It lands, and the Marklar pilot steps out. It walks forward] Greetings, Marklar, I am Marklar. [Two lions and a lioness look at him hungrily.] I come in marklar. [the lions move towards him] Oh, marklar. [the lions jump him and rips him to shreds] AAAAAAAAAA! [the lions run away carrying chunks of the Marklar in their mouths]"
3618,3,13,Woman,"Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus. [a group of Ethiopians sit cross-legged, with their Bibles in front of them on white benches. This is her Bible class. Above them, two ceiling fans spin, clanking a little] Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely? [an Ethiopian attempts to eat one, but Hollis interrupts] No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them. [returns to the front] Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19. [the class does not respond] Come on, remember [pulls down a chart]: reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food. [the students study the chart, then open their Bibles] Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? [glissant as the camera switches to Marvin reading. He lowers his Bible]"
3619,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Doundobi godia dyum * *
3620,3,13,Sister Hollis,"No, Marvin, in God's language. English."
3621,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,"Dongdin * * mium bidu [closes his Bible, leaves it, and heads towards the door]"
3622,3,13,Sister Hollis,"Where are you going? Back to your life of sin? Don't you understand that unless you find Christ, you and all your people are doomed to eternal hellfire? [Marvin just opens the door, walks out, and heads towards the desert. He passes his people, who can do nothing but moan]"
3623,3,13,Ethiopians,Ooooohhh. [some of them cough. Marvin shows surprise as he sees a group of eight people on a hill looking down at a column of smoke. He moves up to them]
3624,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,"Duo bet tum debettum * * ghm * *? [the camera goes over the group to reveal the Marklar's ship. Marvin stares in awe] Mah tah guum tyum * * ghm tm tm. [moves towards it. The chief says something, but Marvin continues to the ship. He touches it, and it opens up for him, the sand washing off its surface. The group on the hill screams with joy. Some of the group runs away]"
3625,3,13,Ethiopian,Necah * * necundat? [Marvin opens the cockpit and hops in]
3626,3,13,Chief,Nn * * de co?
3627,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Umi chu. [presses a button to activate a map display. The cockpit closes and the ship lifts off]
3628,3,13,Ethiopian Woman,Wobe dabiga gm * *.
3629,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,"Gobede *. [presses a button and the ship lurches up. He takes off and comes back, sweeping over the villagers' heads. He takes off into space, into the distance, and then returns. The episode title follows close behind]"
3630,3,13,Mr Garrison,"...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay. [the door opens and two agents enter. They start looking under tables and lifting desks, then lower the blinds...] Uh, can I help you?"
3631,3,13,Agent 1,"Yes. I'm Connelly, and this is Sphinx. We're with the CIA."
3632,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"We're here to speak with some of your students. [turns to them] You [Cartman], you [Kyle], you [Kenny], and you [Stan]."
3633,3,13,Mr Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!"
3634,3,13,Eric Cartman,Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
3635,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!"
3636,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!"
3637,3,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Huh?) [Connelly takes Cartman and Kyle, Sphinx takes Kenny and Stan. They then carry the boys out the door. Sphinx reaches back to close it]"
3638,3,13,Mr Garrison,"I hope you give them the chair! [turns back to the chalkboard] Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. [writes ""Hare Krishnas"" on the board.]"
3639,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, dude, this is not cool!"
3640,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Relax, fatass."
3641,3,13,Eric Cartman,"No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard."
3642,3,13,Stan Marsh,What??
3643,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!"
3644,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Ow, dude! [the hangar doors open and the two agents enter]"
3645,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Ow, dude! [the hangar doors open and the two agents enter]"
3646,3,13,Eric Cartman,[pointing] Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! [Kenny looks at him]
3647,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Relax, boys. We just need to talk with you."
3648,3,13,Stan Marsh,"* I told you, fatass."
3649,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space."
3650,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, cool."
3651,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!
3652,3,13,Eric Cartman,Totally!
3653,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? [holds up a picture of Marvin]"
3654,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin."
3655,3,13,Stan Marsh,Sshh!
3656,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Who?
3657,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!"
3658,3,13,Eric Cartman,Oh. We don't know him.
3659,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"We already know you know him. We have this! [a picture of the boys standing behind Marvin outside King Jimmy's Buffet] Now, who is he?! [Kyle farts, and the boys laugh]"
3660,3,13,Eric Cartman,Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one? [the agents walk away and talk with each other. The boys laugh for a long time...]
3661,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
3662,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,But they're just kids. We can't torture them.
3663,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!"
3664,3,13,Singer,"Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free.I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see."
3665,3,13,Man 1,"[pointing] Oy, look up there! [the ship descends and the engines turn off]"
3666,3,13,Man 2,It's a UFO! [the windshield rolls back]
3667,3,13,Crowd,[start backing up] Oohh?!
3668,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,[appears] Dogom * Dommm * *.
3669,3,13,Man 3,"Boy, that's one creeepy alien."
3670,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Gmm * Mmm-mm * *.
3671,3,13,Man 4,"[prodding] Talk to 'im, Mayor. [the Mayor walks up to Marvin and speaks]"
3672,3,13,Mayor,"Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip"
3673,3,13,Crowd,Churrah! [Marvin pulls out pencil and paper and starts drawing...]
3674,3,13,Mayor,"Look out, he's got a gun! [shields his face. The others cower]"
3675,3,13,Man 5,"Wait, it's not a gun. It's a piece of paper."
3676,3,13,Mayor,"Oh. [the paper has a drawing of Australia and of Marvin's people. Marvin draws an arrow from his people to Australia] Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia."
3677,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,* * Muogleblabla mb'g * *.
3678,3,13,Mayor,"Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. [it looks just like the one he left in Ethiopia. A woman is at the door.]"
3679,3,13,Woman,"Hello-o. [Marvin looks, and the smile leaves his face. He hops back into the craft and takes off]"
3680,3,13,Mayor,Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.
3681,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship?"
3682,3,13,Stan Marsh,We don't know. [some scratching is heard]
3683,3,13,The Boys,Aaaaaaaa! [Sphinx is scratching at a balloon] Aaaaaaaa!
3684,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,[holds up a picture of Marvin in the spacecraft] Who is this person!
3685,3,13,Eric Cartman,[gasping] K-kill me.
3686,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Do it again. [Sphinx scratches the balloon...]
3687,3,13,The Boys,Aaaaaaaa!
3688,3,13,Eric Cartman,"No wait. I'll tell you. [the agents take off their ear muffs] He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him."
3689,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
3690,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Adopted from whom?
3691,3,13,Eric Cartman,Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
3692,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Sally Struthers!
3693,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Where can we find her?!
3694,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
3695,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Good job, fatass!"
3696,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off."
3697,3,13,Stan Marsh,[moving past Kyle and Cartman] Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.
3698,3,13,Feed The Children Foundation Receptionist,"Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now. [the men rise and go for the door, but before they enter Connelly stops and closes the door]"
3699,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive."
3700,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know. [they enter. The storage room has been transformed into awfully dark living quarters for her]"
3701,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Ah, Ms. Struthers."
3702,3,13,Sally Struthers,"Oh ho ho ho. [she now has the shape of a Hutt] Un chaka solo david. Saime no Chewbacca dakaiminbi? ho ho. [""Hello gentlemen. How can I help you?""]"
3703,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
3704,3,13,Sally Struthers,"Oh? Makarendae bi cho. [""I do my best.""] Ho ho ho."
3705,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him. [waves his hand in a Jedi fashion]
3706,3,13,Sally Struthers,Do ba kim.
3707,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin."
3708,3,13,Sally Struthers,"[begins to sniff around] Jonoba unko chocolate Yum Yum bar ancho? [""Is that a chocolate Yum Yum bar in your pocket?""]"
3709,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers [removes it from his coat pocker and waves it around], and there are several more where that came from. [Sally licks her lips. Connelly sees a trash can nearby and opens it, then dangles the bar over it] Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy..."
3710,3,13,Sally Struthers,Mmmmo na ka!
3711,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,[closes the trashcan and walks over with the candy bar] I'm... glad we can do business.
3712,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news."
3713,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? [a shot of Pat Robertson asking for pledges on the CBC channel.]"
3714,3,13,Pat Robertson,"Uh, God wants you to send us money. He needs you to send us money so we can help others."
3715,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, my God, this guy again. [""What we do is- ""]"
3716,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Why would anybody send this asshole money? [""-we go all around the world and-""]"
3717,3,13,Kenny McCormick,"(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) [The boys laugh. ""-we give Bibles and and, and...""]"
3718,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeh-hah. [They hear noise outside, and soon Marvin's ship crashes through the front wall of the house.]"
3719,3,13,Boys,Whoa! [They rush outside to see the rest of the ship. Cartman goes to see the damage]
3720,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh! Aww! [Part of the second story of the house falls away.] Oh, weak! [Marvin hops down from the ship]"
3721,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Starvin' Marvin!
3722,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Bongi groinit * *.
3723,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,He did take a ship.
3724,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!"
3725,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Ingan *.
3726,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing."
3727,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Chede gwodum * * godom.
3728,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,I think he wants us to get in.
3729,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Kick ass! [Marvin returns to the pilot's seat; the others hop in and stand around him.] Wow, this thing is awesome!"
3730,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Let's go somewhere. [Marvin pulls the ship out of Cartman's house and flies low over the ground]
3731,3,13,Singer,"Soaring so high above the world,Never thought I could be so free."
3732,3,13,Stan Marsh,"[the ship goes higher, over other cities] Wow!"
3733,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yes!
3734,3,13,Singer,"I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see."
3735,3,13,Stan Marsh,This is great!
3736,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? [""And it's a wonderful day 'cause something-""]"
3737,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,[turns off the music] Gmmm?
3738,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's better."
3739,3,13,Man,Oooh. [falls back on his pillow. Sister Hollis comes up]
3740,3,13,Sister Hollis,Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you.
3741,3,13,Man,[quickly rising] Nn * wohg *?
3742,3,13,Sister Hollis,"No, it's not food. It's a cross. [hands it to him] And it has your Christian name printed on it. From now on, you are Michael. Can you say ""Michael""? [the man clicks and holds up the cross] Mmmi-chael. [the man clicks again] Oh, well. You'll get it. [walks away and heads over to a family of four] Hello, brother David. Do you have any sins to confess? [David does not respond, but a fly lands on his eye] Anybody? Sins to confess? Joshua? [he just looks up at her] You know, today I'm reminded of Psalm 46, line 39: ""Though the mountains shake and th-"" [the CIA agents walk up]"
3743,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Here they are!
3744,3,13,Sister Hollis,Who are you?
3745,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
3746,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here. [the family stares in horror]"
3747,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too."
3748,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Blubedegub? [points to Utah on the map]
3749,3,13,Eric Cartman,"No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries."
3750,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. [the world map is shown]"
3751,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? [presses a big red button on the left side of the display panel. The ship bucks and heads into space.]"
3752,3,13,Boys,Whooaaa! [the ship rolls sideways for a moment]
3753,3,13,Stan Marsh,"What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! [a wormhole appears before them, and they head for it]"
3754,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! [the ship races into the wormhole]"
3755,3,13,Boys,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [everything inside the ship begins to twist and warp] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [more twisting and warping, and the ship races out of the wormhole into a star system with a green planet. Everything inside the ship is normal again]"
3756,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,[gasps] Where are we?
3757,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Gobin gobedo * * gowog. [the ship heads down into the atmosphere and then towards an island]
3758,3,13,Stan Marsh,"We're on like, some foreign planet."
3759,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
3760,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,"Gewhit * * Gewit um hebed wabaduh. Gabalah. [the ship descends to a plain next to a waterfall, and lands]"
3761,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Badak bladla buk.
3762,3,13,Marklar Leader,Greetings. Welcome to Marklar.
3763,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Uh, thanks."
3764,3,13,Marklar Leader,"I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar."
3765,3,13,Stan Marsh,"U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth."
3766,3,13,Marklar Leader,[bows] Marklar to you.
3767,3,13,Stan Marsh,Cool!
3768,3,13,Eric Cartman,Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
3769,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!"
3770,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! [the Marklar leader looks a bit confused. Marvin steps forward and smiles. The land around the group is green and lush, water is plentiful...]"
3771,3,13,Marklar Leader,We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
3772,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,[joins Marvin] Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
3773,3,13,Marklar Leader,"Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar."
3774,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'."
3775,3,13,Stan Marsh,"[Cartman looks in pleasant wonder] Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here."
3776,3,13,Marklar Leader,"Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you."
3777,3,13,Stan Marsh,Uuh. Thanks.
3778,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,* *.
3779,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him? [the family sits still]"
3780,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"[switching places with Connelly] We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?! [lifts his shades and scans the area] Daha! [picks up a gourd and dangles it] This! This gourd-thingy, for instance. How do you like that, huh? If you ever wanna see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy! [the family just looks at him. At that moment, the Marklar ship zooms over the little village, and the villagers raise a ruckus over Marvin's return. The ship stops and descends, engines roaring]"
3781,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,There it is! [Hollis covers her ears. The ship lands and everyone moves towards it. The windshield rolls back and the boys scramble down from the ship]
3782,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.
3783,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Back away from the space craft, children!"
3784,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar."
3785,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. [the Ethiopians all begin to speak]"
3786,3,13,Sister Hollis,Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?
3787,3,13,Eric Cartman,"No, never. It's perfect."
3788,3,13,Sister Hollis,"Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them. [hurries away]"
3789,3,13,Stan Marsh,What??
3790,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,*. [walks to Hollis] Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.
3791,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!"
3792,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
3793,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,No! [agents rush in from all sides and some black helicopters appear over the space ship. Two FBI agents come and stand behind the boys.]
3794,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,[tugs at Hollis' dress] Dor dor binor hm ghm.
3795,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Call those boys' mothers. [Connelly starts dialing] I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
3796,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, no, dude!"
3797,3,13,Pat Robertson,"[""TO PLEDGE CALL: 1-800-555-2717""] You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan. [a picture of Hollis with two Ethiopians appears over his right shoulder] Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it."
3798,3,13,Susan,Amazing.
3799,3,13,Pat Robertson,"Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ."
3800,3,13,Susan,What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?
3801,3,13,Pat Robertson,"Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser. [a diagram of said cruiser appears over his shoulder: the XT-9000] Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen."
3802,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
3803,3,13,FBI Agent,"[walks up] E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you."
3804,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Tom Brokaw? Oh no, the press already? [the CIA agents walk over]"
3805,3,13,Brokaw,"[sounds like Cartman] Oh. Good day, gentlemen. [the yellow headband and the shape of the pant legs look familiar...]"
3806,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Uh huh. [FBI agents gather behind him and Connelly] Mr. Brokaw, I presume."
3807,3,13,Brokaw,"You presume wisely, sir. I'm here to get the big story, the big scoop. [Marvin tip-toes to the ship unnoticed] I understand that you've found some kind of ship from an alien race. [Marvin opens the cargo door and signals for his people to enter the ship. They start doing so] Seeing as though I am Pulitzer-prize-winning Tom Brokaw..."
3808,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw."
3809,3,13,Brokaw,What?! Do you question my integritah?!
3810,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[from the pants] I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!"
3811,3,13,Brokaw,"Buh-eh, ugh. I had some bad burritos today."
3812,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,"* * wughum chughum * *, * *."
3813,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,[he and Sphinx remove the men's clothes from the boys] Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.
3814,3,13,Stan Marsh,Oh. [the cargo door closes and Marvin is ready to take off]
3815,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Son of a bitch!
3816,3,13,Stan Marsh,Run for it!
3817,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Get 'em! [two FBI agents move]
3818,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!"
3819,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Watch out! Here I come!
3820,3,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-) [trips over a rock and lands on his face] (Oof.)"
3821,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny!
3822,3,13,Eric Cartman,Forget him! He's done for! [Stan climbs up and looks back]
3823,3,13,Stan Marsh,"He's not done for, he's standing right there."
3824,3,13,Kenny McCormick,"(You guys, just fly away!)"
3825,3,13,Eric Cartman,"No, no, he's done for. Come on! [the windshield rolls down and the ship takes off. It zooms into the distance, then straight up into space. The helicopters could not catch up]"
3826,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,[holding Kenny] Nooo!
3827,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Damnit, damnit, damnit!"
3828,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Alright, we made it!"
3829,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!"
3830,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Gakchak ghm. [a blast is felt inside. Its impact site is near the cockpit]
3831,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What was that? [the CBC's XT-9000 appears behind them. Inside, Sister Hollis is manning the bridge, with another woman and four men.]"
3832,3,13,Sister Hollis,"This is the Missionary 600. We have you locked on ""fire: ready."" Turn back right now. [another shot is fired, and the Marklar ship is hit again.]"
3833,3,13,Boys,Aaaa!
3834,3,13,Ethiopians,[tossed to one side of the cargo bay] Whoa!
3835,3,13,Stan Marsh,They're shooting at us.
3836,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar."
3837,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,"[tries all the buttons, including the red one, but to no avail] Midik, gmanjaum * *."
3838,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, how'd we do it last time??"
3839,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself."
3840,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Which button did you press, Cartman??"
3841,3,13,Eric Cartman,U-u-huh. I don't remember.
3842,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,You don't remember?!
3843,3,13,Stan Marsh,"You dumbass, Cartman!"
3844,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. [presses the big red button]"
3845,3,13,Singer,Soaring so high above the world.
3846,3,13,The Boys,Aawwww!
3847,3,13,Singer,Never-
3848,3,13,Sister Hollis,The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough.
3849,3,13,Pat Robertson,"Everyone, the Word of God is going around the world and all your help is so greatly appreciated. Eh-oo What we need now is an argon crystal laser. [the 900txl] Eh you see, an argon crystal laser can pierce thick space holes in a way that other lasers just can't. Send your money now. Uuh-I th-thank you."
3850,3,13,Sally Struthers,[eating her way through a box of food relief] Onadonakami?
3851,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel."
3852,3,13,Sally Struthers,"Chewmbacca vije dai gwo. [""Maybe I do, and maybe I don't.""]"
3853,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.
3854,3,13,Sally Struthers,"Juodo nakahobi? Ho ho ho ho. [""Why should I help you?""]"
3855,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food."
3856,3,13,Sally Struthers,Wo? Wo chaka gom??
3857,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral. [steps aside and brings Kenny in]"
3858,3,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh my God, I get it.)"
3859,3,13,Sally Struthers,Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho. [a small creature pops out and laughs]
3860,3,13,Sister Hollis,"I have the infidels in my sight. [the Marklar ship tries evasive maneuvers, but it is hit again.]"
3861,3,13,Eric Cartman,Holy shit!
3862,3,13,Ethiopians,[tossed to the other side of the cargo bay] Whoa!
3863,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Doye dondabuh. [swings the ship around and fires two blasts at the Missionary 600]
3864,3,13,Crew,Aaah.
3865,3,13,Sister Hollis,"Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes."
3866,3,13,Pat Robertson,"Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin. [a CBC logo pin]"
3867,3,13,6 Crew,Aaah.
3868,3,13,Stan Marsh,"You got 'em, Marvin."
3869,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, now finish 'em off! [a huge junker comes up behind and fires at them]"
3870,3,13,Computer,[female voice] Warning. Deflector shields failing.
3871,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Where did that come from??
3872,3,13,Sally Struthers,"Ho ho ho ho. [the CIA agents stand behind her, and two other men are at the helm]"
3873,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Good! Now get them in our tractor beam! [the beam is activated and holds the Marklar ship in place. The Missionary 600 comes around and faces the Marklar ship]
3874,3,13,Sister Hollis,"Now we've got 'em! [in the Marklar ship, the boys look at the screen...]"
3875,3,13,Sally Struthers,Ho ho ho ho.
3876,3,13,Eric Cartman,It's Sally Struthers!
3877,3,13,Sister Hollis,"Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens."
3878,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Sorry, Marvin. We tried."
3879,3,13,Eric Cartman,Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
3880,3,13,Sally Struthers,Wo?
3881,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. [Sally looks moved]"
3882,3,13,Sally Struthers,"Holna chewbacca? [""Because of me?""]"
3883,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,"Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite. [points. The camera pans over to a panel which shows Kenny encased in carbonite]"
3884,3,13,Sally Struthers,"Dama doko nou na oh. [""Let him speak.""]"
3885,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. [Sally considers Cartman's statements for a moment, then...]"
3886,3,13,Sally Struthers,"Oh, foada! [""You're right!"" She presses a button, and the tractor beam switches off the Marklar ship and on the Missionary 600]"
3887,3,13,6 Crew,[the bridge jerks a bit] Whoa! [the beam pulls the Missionary 600 closer to the junker.]
3888,3,13,Eric Cartman,She bought it.
3889,3,13,Stan Marsh,Sally Struthers is saving us!
3890,3,13,Pat Robertson,"Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker [pictured in a window], which is uh the favorite ship of the Hutts, and she has trapped oureh, our our new CBC ship in an uh [struggling] poe-sitronic tractor beam. [a stage hand holds up this cue card that reads: Tractor Beam, so we're gonna need a Ionic Tractor Disruptor] Uh, so we're gonna need an ionic tractor disruptor. Now now, not a regular ionic di- tractor disruptor, but a negative ionic tractor disruptor to uh, help spread the Word of Jesus. [to Susan, softly] I don't have a fucking idea up here."
3891,3,13,Stan Marsh,Now's our chance!
3892,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Wait. I remember. It was the red button! [presses it, and the ship zooms away. The wormhole appears again and the ship head for it]"
3893,3,13,Sister Hollis,They've opened the wormhole!
3894,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"It's pulling us in! [the junker and the Missionary 600 give chase. All three ships enter the wormhole, and all experience its warping effects.]"
3895,3,13,Boys,Aaaah!
3896,3,13,6 Crew,"Aaaah! [the ships rush out of the wormhole and into Alpha Seti VI, near the Marklar planet]"
3897,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Marvin... [everyone talks at once]
3898,3,13,The Marklar,"Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar."
3899,3,13,Sister Hollis,"Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins."
3900,3,13,The Marklar,Who? Marklar?
3901,3,13,Stan Marsh,"We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us."
3902,3,13,The Marklar,Brought m- marklar??
3903,3,13,Sister Hollis,"What is ""marklar""?"
3904,3,13,The Marklar,Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.
3905,3,13,CIA Agents Connelly and Bill Sphinx,Doesn't that get confusing?
3906,3,13,The Marklar,"Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!"
3907,3,13,The Marklar,[in orange robe] Yes?
3908,3,13,The Marklar,You see?
3909,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps forward] Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars."
3910,3,13,The Marklar,"Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true."
3911,3,13,Sister Hollis,What the hell did he say?
3912,3,13,Stan Marsh,"[hushed] Wow! Good job, dude!"
3913,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks.
3914,3,13,The Marklar,The marklars can stay!
3915,3,13,Ethiopians,Wooo!
3916,3,13,Boys,Alright!
3917,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Alright,"
3918,3,13,The Marklar,You marklars must leave.
3919,3,13,Sister Hollis,But you will all burn forever in eternal hellfire. [she and the other woman are taken away]
3920,3,13,The Marklar,"Yes, that's nice. Thank you for stopping by."
3921,3,13,Stan Marsh,"Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again."
3922,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Chak chak glika gm gm guchab mglup.
3923,3,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth."
3924,3,13,Sally Struthers,Bwo chaaga bi.
3925,3,13,Boys,"[leaving] Goodbye, Marvin."
3926,3,13,Starvin' Marvin,Chak chak m geteaub m * *.
3927,3,13,Stan Marsh,Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
3928,3,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh."
3929,3,13,Stan Marsh,Dude!
3930,3,13,Eric Cartman,What? We're not gonna come visit him.
3931,3,13,Stan Marsh,"I know, but you don't tell him that!"
3932,3,13,Eric Cartman,"T'heh, whatever. [the Ethiopians chatter over their new home and head for the lake at the foot of the waterfall]"
3933,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Ready? 1-2-3-4. [the boys begin to march forward and play.]
3934,3,14,Cartman,"Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?! [answers himself] Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!"
3935,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
3936,3,14,Cartman,I'm playing the drum.
3937,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Well, you have to hit it softer!"
3938,3,14,Cartman,"You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! [to the drum, hitting it once in a while] Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!! [to Kyle] That's how you rock, dude."
3939,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!"
3940,3,14,Cartman,I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
3941,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!"
3942,3,14,Cartman,"Ey, I'll get it!"
3943,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!"
3944,3,14,Cartman,Yes I will!
3945,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. [again, the march and play. Cartman gets carried away and the others glare at him]"
3946,3,14,Cartman,"Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, dammit!"
3947,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Cartman!!! [Cartman stops]
3948,3,14,Cartman,What?
3949,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Give me the drum, and you play the flute."
3950,3,14,Cartman,No way! Flutes are totally gay!
3951,3,14,Kenny McCormick,[inspects his flute] (Oh. Flutes are gay?)
3952,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!"
3953,3,14,Cartman,"Oh! Well, you know what I say?! [drops his drum and jumps on it] Screw you guys, I'm going home! [walks away, leaving the drum split in two]"
3954,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,You dick!
3955,3,14,Cartman,Later.
3956,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield. [the townsmen are dressed in the Blue and the Grey] First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!"
3957,3,14,Men,"[jump and cheer] Yes! Woohoo, yea!"
3958,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. [Kyle and Kenny are also present]"
3959,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,He'll show.
3960,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,He'd better!
3961,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores."
3962,3,14,Men,Whoa. Mmm.
3963,3,14,Mr Garrison,Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.
3964,3,14,Stuart McCormick,"[coughs] Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too."
3965,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh, [Grandpa rolls up in his wheelchair amid applause] the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924."
3966,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?"
3967,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Dude, that's not cool."
3968,3,14,Cartman,"[arrives dressed in the Grey] Good morning, gentlemen."
3969,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
3970,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
3971,3,14,Cartman,"Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time."
3972,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!"
3973,3,14,Cartman,"Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did."
3974,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead."
3975,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!"
3976,3,14,Cartman,"Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win."
3977,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"No they're not, stupid!"
3978,3,14,Cartman,Yes we are!
3979,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,How much do you wanna bet?!
3980,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. [continues as the boys speak]"
3981,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!"
3982,3,14,Cartman,"Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month."
3983,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
3984,3,14,Cartman,Right.
3985,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,You're on!
3986,3,14,Cartman,"Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. [walks away]"
3987,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Hoohoo what a dumbass!
3988,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
3989,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
3990,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!"
3991,3,14,Men,"[jump and cheer] Yes! Woohoo, yea!"
3992,3,14,Announcer,"Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South [Butters is there]; in blue are the Union, from the North [Chef is there, and Kenny has the drum]."
3993,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"[addressing the spectators] It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle. [blows the whistle]"
3994,3,14,Jimbo Kern,[leading the South] Forward! [The South advances]
3995,3,14,Randy Marsh,"[leading the North] Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! [the North advances, the boys play their tune]"
3996,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Fire! [some guns go off]
3997,3,14,Confederate Reenactors,Yeah!
3998,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Alright men, fire! [some guns go off]"
3999,3,14,Union Reenactors,"Yeah! [the battle is joined, and men left and right begin to drop away. Others scream]"
4000,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down."
4001,3,14,Ned Gerblansky,[Jimbo fires a few shots] Ow.
4002,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Yeh-hah! [the battle continues, and even a cow gets into the act]"
4003,3,14,Man 1,"[in the stands] Oh, so this is what it was like. [the battle continues, but now it's hand-to-hand combat. Cartman reaches the bell and starts to push it down the hill]"
4004,3,14,Man 2,Hey! What's that guy doing?!
4005,3,14,Cartman,Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
4006,3,14,Reenactors,[on both sides] Huh? Wha-?
4007,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,What the hell?
4008,3,14,Randy Marsh,He took the bell!
4009,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,He can't do that!
4010,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
4011,3,14,Cartman,[skating by on the bell] Hooray for the South!
4012,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Cartman, you can't do that!"
4013,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,God dammit! Now we have to start over!
4014,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Alrighty everyone. [Cartman walks up] We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time."
4015,3,14,Cartman,But why? Why should they get the bell?
4016,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose."
4017,3,14,Cartman,But we don't have to lose.
4018,3,14,Jimbo Kern,What??
4019,3,14,Cartman,"[assuming command] Gentlemen, we can win this battle! [paces] Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" [some of the men drink schnapps]"
4020,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[takes a swig] By God, he's right!"
4021,3,14,Mr Garrison,Jimbo!
4022,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!"
4023,3,14,Mr Garrison,Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
4024,3,14,Stuart McCormick,I'm tired of losing this battle!
4025,3,14,Jimbo Kern,And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
4026,3,14,Reenactors,Yeah!
4027,3,14,Reenactor,Yeah! [drops down drunk. Cartman grins]
4028,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to- [turns at the sound of a gun shot and looks as the Confederates charge down the field]"
4029,3,14,Confederate 1,Yaaaaah!
4030,3,14,Confederate 2,Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!
4031,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, what are they doing?"
4032,3,14,Mr Garrison,[drunk] You Yankee sons of bitches!
4033,3,14,Randy Marsh,[a Confederate shoots him on the belly] Ow! That hurt!
4034,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"God dammit, what the hell are they doing?!"
4035,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,What do we do?!
4036,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Run for your life, dude! [the boys run off. Cartman watches from the hill as the battle rages on]"
4037,3,14,Cartman,God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
4038,3,14,Reenactor,Come on!
4039,3,14,Randy Marsh,[tackled by Jimbo] Oh?
4040,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[pins Randy to the ground] Surrender your men, general!"
4041,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!"
4042,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!"
4043,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Alright, alright. We surrender. [the Union soldiers drop their guns and raise their arms. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk out from behind a tree with their hands up.]"
4044,3,14,Barbrady,[in the stands] The South win?
4045,3,14,Jimbo Kern,The South wins!
4046,3,14,Reenactors,"Yeah, woohoo!"
4047,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,God dammit!
4048,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[walks up to Randy] Well, we can all be friends now. [nudges him] Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. [hands Randy a bottle]"
4049,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment."
4050,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Aw, come on. Have a little sip. [Randy sips]"
4051,3,14,Cartman,"[walks up to Stan and Kyle] So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?"
4052,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"You cheated, Cartman!"
4053,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!"
4054,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!"
4055,3,14,Cartman,[sighs] I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. [the men are getting more drunk]
4056,3,14,Randy Marsh,[talking to Stuart with slurred speech] All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
4057,3,14,Mr Garrison,"That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!"
4058,3,14,Bartender,Yeah.
4059,3,14,Reenactor,Yeah.
4060,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,You're dreaming!
4061,3,14,Cartman,[walks up to Jimbo] Perhaps we should take Topeka.
4062,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Huh?
4063,3,14,Cartman,"They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah."
4064,3,14,Jimbo Kern,They don't?!
4065,3,14,Cartman,No. I say we take Topeka.
4066,3,14,Jimbo Kern,[to the crowd] You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
4067,3,14,Randy Marsh,Huh?
4068,3,14,Stuart McCormick,That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
4069,3,14,Mr Garrison,I'll bet we could!
4070,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"I'll bet we could, too! [pounds on the podium]"
4071,3,14,Cartman,[throwing his voice] I'll bet you can't.
4072,3,14,Jimbo Kern,[jumps back] What?! [then walks and stands in front of the podium] Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
4073,3,14,Cartman,"[fake voice] I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!"
4074,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
4075,3,14,Reenactor 1,Yeah.
4076,3,14,Reenactor 2,Yeah.
4077,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[walks to the Union soldiers] All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!"
4078,3,14,Reenactor 3,Yeah.
4079,3,14,Reenactor 4,Yeah.
4080,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Well, the Union be damned!"
4081,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Let's go!
4082,3,14,Men,Yeah! [all walk out]
4083,3,14,Cartman,"[trailing, stops by his friends] Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month."
4084,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop."
4085,3,14,Cartman,"Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens."
4086,3,14,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!) [exits with Cartman. The men charge out of the banquet hall growling]
4087,3,14,Mailman,"Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis."
4088,3,14,Mrs Hollis,"Hello, Ralph."
4089,3,14,Ralph,Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?
4090,3,14,Mrs Hollis,I'm afraid I was grading papers pretty late and- [both turn in the direction of a rumble. Everyone stops and looks in the same direction]
4091,3,14,Driver,"What's that noise, officer? [the officer looks, and the South Park men rise over a hill and charge towards town.]"
4092,3,14,South Park Men,Yeah! Yeah!
4093,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
4094,3,14,Topeka Traffic Officer,[soothing his ass] Ow!
4095,3,14,Stuart McCormick,"Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! [the church bell rings. Jimbo is pulling at the rope]"
4096,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!"
4097,3,14,Reenactors,Yeah!
4098,3,14,Randy Marsh,"[still holding Ralph] Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!"
4099,3,14,Ralph,"Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store."
4100,3,14,Randy Marsh,WHERE?!
4101,3,14,Ralph,"[desperately] At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!"
4102,3,14,Randy Marsh,"[drops Ralph] Come on, boys! [they all rush the store]"
4103,3,14,Mrs Hollis,[looking on] This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
4104,3,14,Cartman,[walks by] Excuse meh.
4105,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas."
4106,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?"
4107,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Oh here comes the bus. [a tourist bus. Butters is behind the doors waiting to come out. The doors open and Butters exits. The bus leaves] Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
4108,3,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, conuh- [salutes] Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. [offers it]"
4109,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,What battlefield?!
4110,3,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see? [hands the message to Stan] Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? [Stan opens and reads the message. A Ken Burns effect sequence starts using a 19th century sepia image of Cartman as General Lee]"
4111,3,14,Cartman,"Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee"
4112,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[crumples the message into a ball and throws it away] God dammit, that fat piece of shit!"
4113,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
4114,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,That would suck so much ass.
4115,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"We have to stop him, dude."
4116,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?"
4117,3,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch."
4118,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,We'll give you 10 bucks.
4119,3,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. O-oh, okay."
4120,3,14,News Reporter,"...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news, [the group's entry into Topeka is shown] a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of America. [the guy throwing the Molotov cocktail is shown] The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number. [one last attack is shown] So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern [he is shown armed], who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills."
4121,3,14,Jimbo Kern,[now bloated and sluggish] Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick. [vomits] Blouach.
4122,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought."
4123,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed."
4124,3,14,Man,[running] Aaaaa!
4125,3,14,Brunet,They say you can either fight them or join them.
4126,3,14,Blond,Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!
4127,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[now in town] Dad, Dad. [Randy appears and stops] Mom wants you to come home."
4128,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging. [a resident runs by] Get over here!"
4129,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!"
4130,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,"This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!"
4131,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
4132,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,More schnapps! [moves towards it]
4133,3,14,Sgt Larsen,[the National Guard arrives] I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists.
4134,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado."
4135,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!"
4136,3,14,Dawkins,Sir!
4137,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,Fire a warning flare!
4138,3,14,Dawkins,"Yes sir! [launches the flare. The flare goes up in the air, lands right on Kenny and burns him to a crisp.]"
4139,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Medic! [amid the panic, a medic comes and extinguishes Kenny.]"
4140,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,Woops.
4141,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
4142,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,You bastards!
4143,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Hey!
4144,3,14,Soldier,"[off camera] We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children."
4145,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,Then how do we stop them?
4146,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
4147,3,14,Cartman,"Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle [her brows rise in surprise] on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee."
4148,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home."
4149,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Nice thinkin', Billy."
4150,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,Let's go. [they proceed to carry the schnapps away]
4151,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[enters Cartman's tent] Where to next, General?"
4152,3,14,Cartman,"[with pipe in mouth] Where did the Confederates go, son?"
4153,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated."
4154,3,14,Cartman,"Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go."
4155,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?"
4156,3,14,Cartman,[turns around] Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
4157,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Um, sure. [exits to get some schnapps. He lifts a case and removes the lid, but finds the case empty. He takes a second case and again finds it empty] What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?"
4158,3,14,Randy Marsh,[with a guitar] We're out of s'more schnapps?
4159,3,14,Mr Garrison,[checks his empty bottle] That can't be.
4160,3,14,Jimbo Kern,I guess we drank it all.
4161,3,14,Dawkins,Now what?
4162,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave."
4163,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Yeah.
4164,3,14,Soldier 1,Uugh.
4165,3,14,Soldier 2,Ouch.
4166,3,14,Randy Marsh,"[exits his tent] Oh, my head."
4167,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,Where am I?
4168,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[sits next to Ned on a bench] Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had."
4169,3,14,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head."
4170,3,14,Mr Garrison,"[rises in his sleeping bag behind Stuart] Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today."
4171,3,14,Stuart McCormick,"Me, too."
4172,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[stands] Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick."
4173,3,14,Cartman,[at his tent entrance] Where are you going?
4174,3,14,Jimbo Kern,We're goin' home kid. Come on. [walks off]
4175,3,14,Cartman,"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! [Randy stops by]"
4176,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us."
4177,3,14,Cartman,[watching the sober Confederates walk away] No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
4178,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[rushes up with Kyle and Grandpa] Haha! You lose, fatass!"
4179,3,14,Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!"
4180,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history. [Cartman eyes a phone...] You see, history is forever, [...and an empty schnapps case next to it] and everything happens for a reason. [Cartman turns and walks] Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-"
4181,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Where are you going?
4182,3,14,Cartman,"This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! [Stan and Kyle just look at each other]"
4183,3,14,Randy Marsh,Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
4184,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here."
4185,3,14,Stuart McCormick,"Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? [two schnapps trucks pull up and the drivers drop down. They head to the rears of the trucks and start unloading case after case of Jagermin's]"
4186,3,14,Suzette,"Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl. [Cartman gets out of the truck and walks up behind her] We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need."
4187,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff."
4188,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,Me neither.
4189,3,14,Cartman,"Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw."
4190,3,14,Suzette,"Yes, please. Do a shot out of my breasts. [pours two bottles into her cleavage]"
4191,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order."
4192,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again! [Ned tumbles by wearing a fancy lampshade]"
4193,3,14,Mr Garrison,"[rushes up] Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of ""grab ass."""
4194,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,"What's ""grab ass?"""
4195,3,14,Mr Garrison,You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
4196,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Ey, that sounds fun. [grabs Mr. Garrison's ass]"
4197,3,14,Mr Garrison,Hohoho.
4198,3,14,Solders,I got you. Oo-oh. [the men laugh and chase each other around trying to grab asses here and there]
4199,3,14,Cartman,"[intervenes] Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take."
4200,3,14,Jimbo Kern,You heard the General.
4201,3,14,Soldiers,Yeah! [all charge out. Empty schnapps cases litter the field]
4202,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[reaches the scene a bit late] Oh, no."
4203,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,We'll never stop them now.
4204,3,14,Soldiers,Woohoo!
4205,3,14,Cartman,Yes! Yes!
4206,3,14,Guide,"Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action."
4207,3,14,Tourist,And the Confederates won the fort?
4208,3,14,Guide,"Yes. [turns and leads the group to the gates] Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you. [the group stares in awe at the seemingly thousands of Confederates just outside the gate. The guide turns to see...] Uh..."
4209,3,14,Cartman,Take the fort!
4210,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Charge!
4211,3,14,Men,"Yeah! [they enter] Woohoo, yeah, come on!"
4212,3,14,Jimbo Kern,We got it! The fort is ours! [a cannon blast knocks Randy down]
4213,3,14,Randy Marsh,What was that?? [the National Guard has caught up with the Confederates and now surrounds the fort.]
4214,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"[on the bullhorn] Attention political activists: you are on government historical document property! Surrender the document with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce."
4215,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[takes the bullhorn] Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here."
4216,3,14,Cartman,Suck my ass!
4217,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"What do we do, General? We're outnumbered."
4218,3,14,Cartman,We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
4219,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up."
4220,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there."
4221,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar."
4222,3,14,Elderly Voice,"Hold it right there! [The camera zooms out to show the rowdy reinforcements converge on Stan, Kyle, Grandpa, and the National Guard]"
4223,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! [other men grin with joy]"
4224,3,14,Cartman,I knew they would!
4225,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Aw, dammit!"
4226,3,14,Leader,[saluting] We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!
4227,3,14,Men,Yee-haw! All right!
4228,3,14,Cartman,Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
4229,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! [Clinton looks out the window with two advisors]"
4230,3,14,Vice President Al Gore,"Oh boy, this doesn't look good."
4231,3,14,Advisor,"It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people."
4232,3,14,Aide,Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists! [Clinton reads:]
4233,3,14,Cartman,"Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei."
4234,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands."
4235,3,14,Advisor,"What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them."
4236,3,14,Vice President Al Gore,"As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?"
4237,3,14,President Bill Clinton,My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.
4238,3,14,Aide,[salutes] Sir!
4239,3,14,Vice President Al Gore,I'm so glad I don't have your job. [Clinton is surprised]
4240,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves."
4241,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!"
4242,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?"
4243,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson! [wheels away]"
4244,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War."
4245,3,14,Confederates,[exulting] Hooray!
4246,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[to Cartman] Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei."
4247,3,14,Cartman,"I don't. I made it up. [Kyle and Stan approach Clinton as Lincoln and Davis, respectively]"
4248,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Hey! Who's that?!
4249,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States."
4250,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy."
4251,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?"
4252,3,14,Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?!
4253,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!"
4254,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering."
4255,3,14,Cartman,What?!
4256,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year."
4257,3,14,Confederates,Wow!
4258,3,14,Randy Marsh,A whole year?
4259,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted."
4260,3,14,President Bill Clinton,That's it? I-I don't have to sign this thing? [Kyle and Stan turn to each other and shake hands]

4274,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,What??
4275,3,14,Cartman,The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
4276,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War."
4277,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Awwww!

4302,3,15,Man on Porto Potty,"[opens the door] Sometimes he hangs off the end of your ass
And won't fall in the toilet
Cuz he's just clinging to your sphincter
And he won't drop off and so you ...shake your ass around
And try to get it to drop into the toilet
And finally it does.. [Timmy closes the door and clears his throat]"

4306,3,15,Various Kids,Howdy Ho!
4307,3,15,Mr Hankey,"Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world."
4308,3,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah. [picks it up] This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
[begins to dance]
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.

Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay."
4312,3,15,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops] Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!"
4313,3,15,Eric Cartman,"[moves to block Kyle from view. Kyle moves to the other side of the screen to be seen. They go back and forth like this for a while]

4520,3,15,Mr Hankey,"Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman."
4521,3,15,Eric Cartman,"And...
''O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
[The Star of the Nativity appears, then the Three Wise Men]
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
[The Nativity and Cartman are seen in the background, Formal Cartman vanishes]
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
[Formal Cartman before a starry sky]
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
[Present-day Cartman finishes decorating the tree, helps himself to a pie]
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
[Little Drummer Cartman stands before the manger scene, Present-day Cartman is seen tearing into his gifts back at home.]
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
[back at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman turns to look at Baby Jesus.]
Fall (Fall) [four angels appear behind Formal Cartman]
On your knees (On your knees) [Cartman falls on his knees]
And hear (Can't you hear)
The angels'.. something (Voices)
O night (O night)
[Present-day Cartman tosses in bed, which is covered in candy canes]
Divine (Divine)
[Formal Cartman] The night
When I get presents (O-o)
[at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman takes the gifts meant for Jesus]
O night (O o-night) [loads them up on his camel, with other presents]
Di-viiine! [Present-day Cartman rips into more presents at home]
[Formal Cartman] O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! [Little Drummer Cartman leads the gift-laden camels away]
Oh. Ah. Ch."
4522,3,15,Mr Hankey,"Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison."
4523,3,15,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season."
4524,3,15,Class,[flatly] Awww.
4525,3,15,Kenny McCormick,(What?!)
4526,3,15,Mr Garrison,"Now, pay attention. Ahem...
I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East [points it out]
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.[shows some Arabic writing]
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, [tosses the picture away]

[In the Middle East]
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes [rips the Koran out of the Muslim's hand and dresses him up as a tree]
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday [removes the veils of two women]
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. [sticks a candy cane in the man's house]

There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. [pulls down a chart showing India's demerits.]
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.[holds up a book: ""The Night Before Christmas""]
And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,

[In India, next to a swami sitting on a bed of nails]
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. [gives beef to one man, pours eggnog on another]
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. [wraps a few people in Christmas lights]
So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. [passes out wreaths]

Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,

Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. [throws some straw on the musicians]
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. [knocks down the Shintoist and dumps gifts on him, and wraps others in lights]

[dressed as Santa, dances around the class]
On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
""Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you."" [Mr. Hat claps]
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat."
4527,3,15,News Anchor,"Frizzies, at 11."
4528,3,15,Various Kids,Howdy-ho!
4529,3,15,Shelly Marsh,"I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in [Stan sticks out his tongue and wiggles his hands on his ears]
On Christmas Day, in the morning. [Kyle pulls the ends of his lips apart and goes cock-eyed]

And what was in those ships, all three? [Stan starts to slurp on his fingers, then the boys chuckle]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- [turns and points at them]
Shut up, turds! [silence]
-was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, in the morning?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there [Stan mimics Shelly with exaggerated expression, Kyle stifles a laugh]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day [Kyle cracks up]
The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! [The boys cover their mouths. Kyle stifles his laughing]
-Christ were there
On Christmas Day, in the morning.

Let us all rejoice, amain, [Stan pulls his cap over his face, Kyle flaps his ear flaps]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day [the boys burst our laughing]
And let- [walks to the boys]
I told you to shut up! [Stan stifles his laugh]
[back at the piano] -us all rejoice, amain,
On Christmas Day, in the morning. [the boys make faces again]

Shelly is starting to get pissed [the boys begin to chuckle]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day [the chuckle get louder]
Shelly got up and killed the turds [the laughs roll out]
On Christmas Day, in the MORNING! [picks up the piano...]"
4530,3,15,Stan Marsh,AAAA! [...and slams it down on the boys. She walks away.]
4531,3,15,Mr Hankey,"Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season."
4532,3,15,Emcee,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to McKemick's. Now, please put your hands together and welcome... Saint Nicholas and Jesus Christ. [Jesus and Santa enter on stage, and the audience claps]"
4533,3,15,Santa Claus,"Hello, everybody!"
4534,3,15,Jesus Christ,[waves] How are y'all doing tonight?
4535,3,15,Santa Claus,"You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years."
4536,3,15,Jesus Christ,"That's right, Santa, and we love each and every one of them. Like this one.
Joy to the world, for I have come.
Let earth receive Me!
Let every heart prepare Me room. [gets some applause]"
4537,3,15,Santa Claus,And heaven and nature sing...
4538,3,15,Jesus Christ,And heaven and nature sing...
4539,3,15,Santa Claus,And heaven and nature sing...
4540,3,15,Jesus Christ,And heaven and na-
4541,3,15,Both,And heaven and heaven and nature sing.
4542,3,15,Santa Claus,"You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. [get some applause]
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys"
4543,3,15,Both,"[sway together]
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?"
4544,3,15,Santa Claus,"Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me."
4545,3,15,Jesus Christ,"He he hoo, get away! [pushes him away]"
4546,3,15,Santa Claus,Go away??
4547,3,15,Jesus Christ,Get away.
4548,3,15,Santa Claus,Where away?
4549,3,15,Jesus Christ,"[gets some applause]
Away in the manger, no crib for My bed
That's where cute little old Me lay down My sweet head.
The stars in the sky (Santa: Ooooo)"
4550,3,15,Both,Looked down where I lay.
4551,3,15,Jesus Christ,Cute little eight-pound me (Santa: Oo-oo)
4552,3,15,Both,asleep in (Santa: on) the hay.
4553,3,15,Jesus Christ,"[gets some applause and sings upbeat]
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me..."
4554,3,15,Santa Claus,"Here's one, Jol-"
4555,3,15,Jesus Christ,"Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory-"
4556,3,15,Santa Claus,"Hey, it's my turn."
4557,3,15,Jesus Christ,"-to Me!
Silent Night,"
4558,3,15,Santa Claus,Uh.
4559,3,15,Jesus Christ,Holy Night
4560,3,15,Santa Claus,Santa Cl- em
4561,3,15,Jesus Christ,"All is calm, all is bright
 'Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me."
4562,3,15,Santa Claus,Saint Nicholas... can't think of one.
4563,3,15,Jesus Christ,"Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
[slowing] Sleep in heavenly peace."
4564,3,15,Santa Claus,"Okay, Jesus. Here's one you might remember:
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twistin' through the dusty land."
4565,3,15,Jesus Christ,"Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-"
4566,3,15,Santa Claus,"I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving. [walks off the stage]"
4567,3,15,Jesus Christ,"Aw, come on, Santa. You can't leave."
4568,3,15,Santa Claus,"Aw, fuck you, Jesus!"
4569,3,15,Jesus Christ,But Santa... The weather outside is frightful
4570,3,15,Santa Claus,[offscreen] Aw.
4571,3,15,Jesus Christ,But the fire so delightful
4572,3,15,Santa Claus,"[returns to the stage] Well, since I've no place to go."
4573,3,15,Both,"Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. [more applause]"
4574,3,15,Jesus Christ,It doesn't show signs of stoppin'.
4575,3,15,Santa Claus,But I brought some corn for poopity-poppin'.
4576,3,15,Jesus Christ,"The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
[Santa: Snow... snow... snow.]"
4577,3,15,Both,"The fire is slowly dyin',"
4578,3,15,Santa Claus,"And, my dear, we're still good-bop-be-byein',"
4579,3,15,Jesus Christ,"But as long as you love me so,"
4580,3,15,Both,"[they dance and hold hands, then Jesus twirls him. Santa spins off the stage]
Let it snow, let it snow,"
4581,3,15,Jesus Christ,let it snow!
4582,3,15,Santa Claus,"[slides back on stage on his knees]
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!
[the club claps enthusiastically. The pianist winks at the duo and points at them. Jesus points back, and Santa holds up a thumb]"
4583,3,15,News Anchor,"Fighting frizzies, at 11."
4584,3,15,Various Kids,Howdy-ho!
4585,3,15,Mr Hankey,"Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was sure nice hangin' out with y'all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this:

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay. [hops out of the bowl]
From now on, our troubles will be miles away.
[hops onto a ham as a family of four looks on happily, leaves his mark,then hops onto his armchair]"
4586,3,15,With boys,"[In the next scene Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny join him. Clips of Wendy, Sheila, the Mayor, Ms. Crabtree, and Liane follow.]
Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days, of yore.
[The females join Stan and Kyle: Wendy, Shelly, Sheila, Liane, Mrs. McCormick, Nurse Gollum, Principal Victoria, the Mayor, Sharon, and Ms. Crabtree.]
Faithful friends who are dear to us
[Cartman strokes Mr. Kitty. Stan and Kyle decorate the chandelier]
Gather near to us once more.
[Mr. Hankey hops onto Santa's shoulder as Jesus looks on]"
4587,3,15,The Boys,"Through the years we all will be together
[the boys embrace shoulders and stand united]
If the Fates allow.
[the chandelier drops on Kenny and the others back away, shocked]"
4588,3,15,Mr Hankey,"Hang a shining star upon the highest bough. [Kyle lifts Mr. Hankey up to do this. Sharon hugs and kisses Stan, JFK and Hitler approach the fireplace and embrace]"
4589,3,15,With Boys,"And have yourself a merry little Christmas now. [Some of the characters in the other songs come in and smile: Sheila, Gerald, Ike, Mr. Mackey in a bell, Satan, Jimmy the mailman, Jesus, Santa, Hitler, Mr. Garrison in Santa outfit, and Shelly. Kyle climbs down from the ladder with Mr. Hankey in hand and stands with Stan and Cartman, and rats rush in to chew on Kenny.]"
4590,3,15,Eric Cartman,"[takes Mr. Hankey from Kyle] Time to go, Mr. Hankey."
4591,3,15,Mr Hankey,"Goodbye, everybody, [Cartman flushes him down] and Meeeeerry Christmas! [Stan and Kyle join Cartman to see Mr. Hankey be flushed away.]"
4592,3,15,Kyle Broflovski,"[into the toilet bowl] Bye, Mr. Hankey. See you next year."
4593,3,15,News Anchor,"And now, fighting the frizzies. [begins to box what looks like a frizzy monster.]"
4594,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome."
4595,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
4596,3,16,Eric Cartman,[runs up] You guys! You guys! [pants] Guess what?
4597,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"What, fatass?!"
4598,3,16,Eric Cartman,"I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! [grins]"
4599,3,16,Kenny McCormick,(...What?)
4600,3,16,Stan Marsh,No you didn't!
4601,3,16,Eric Cartman,Yes! I really did.
4602,3,16,Stan Marsh,How do you know?
4603,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Well, because yesterday I got my period. [lets the words hang there for a moment]"
4604,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,You got your what?
4605,3,16,Eric Cartman,"My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month."
4606,3,16,Stan Marsh,"You're making that up! [a woman steps out of a small building, and he addresses her] Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?"
4607,3,16,Miss Aliton,"Well boys, ah-I don't think I can tell you. Ah-"
4608,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Please, it's important."
4609,3,16,Miss Aliton,"Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there. [points to the region]"
4610,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! [Miss Aliton turns and walks away. The boys turn to face Cartman]"
4611,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture. [begins to dance away backwards] I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. [skips out of view]"
4612,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us."
4613,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, maybe we'll get ours soon, too. I'm gonna go and see if I'm bleeding out my ass."
4614,3,16,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
4615,3,16,Anchorman,"In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics. [turns to face another camera, and a new picture, ""New Year's Eve 1999"" appears] Well, it's just four days until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another. [In New York, amid burning buildings, one man beats another man over the head with a bat. In Paris, people drop down from on high, and in Beijing people torch each other] But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by."
4616,3,16,Netzel,"Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park. [the camera begins to pan to the right. A man with two kids next to him sit in chairs. Skeeter and his friends are there, too] Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love. [the front door opens] Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out! [turns to face the house. Jesus peeks out from it]"
4617,3,16,Woman,"[picks up her son and points Jesus out] Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?"
4618,3,16,Boy,"He's neat, Mommy. [cameras go off as the crowd stands behind some ""Jesus line. Do not cross"" lines. Jesus drops back into his house, then peeks out again]"
4619,3,16,Netzel,"[softly] Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous. [Jesus moves forward] But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!"
4620,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing? [people lower their cameras, puzzled] Can I help you with something? [no one moves]"
4621,3,16,Netzel,"...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus."
4622,3,16,Jesus Christ,Uuh-huh?
4623,3,16,Netzel,"Well, it's ""The Millennium""."
4624,3,16,Man 1,Yeah.
4625,3,16,Man 2,Yeah.
4626,3,16,Man 3,Yeah.
4627,3,16,Cameraman,Right.
4628,3,16,Jesus Christ,"So, what happens at the millennium?"
4629,3,16,Netzel,...I don't know.
4630,3,16,Jimbo Kern,We thought you did.
4631,3,16,Y2K Man,"Yeah, you're supposed to know!"
4632,3,16,Man 4,Yeah!
4633,3,16,Man 5,"Yeah, you're Jesus."
4634,3,16,Man 6,Hey!
4635,3,16,Man 5,You're the one in control.
4636,3,16,Jesus Christ,Oh. Well. Yea. Believe in me and ye shall find peace.
4637,3,16,Mr Garrison,"Yeah yeah yeah, we've heard that crap for about 2000 years now! We wanna hear somethin' new! It's the year 2000, for Christ's sake!"
4638,3,16,Crowd,Yeah!
4639,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Well, what do ya want?"
4640,3,16,Fr Maxi,We want to see God!
4641,3,16,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, with our own eyes."
4642,3,16,Crowd,Yeah!
4643,3,16,Jimbo Kern,We followed blindly for thousands of years and we think the least God can do is show up for New Year's Eve 1999!
4644,3,16,Crowd,Yeah!
4645,3,16,Woman,That's right!
4646,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Oh. Uuuh, let me think about that for a minute. [backs up and closes the door. The people in the crowd are left to talk amongst themselves]"
4647,3,16,Man With Picket Sign,[to man to his left] Is that good?
4648,3,16,Man 7,I don't know.
4649,3,16,Man 8,I don't know. Is that good or not?!
4650,3,16,Stan Marsh,Hello?
4651,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, did you get your period yet?"
4652,3,16,Stan Marsh,"No, there's no blood coming out of my ass."
4653,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty."
4654,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways."
4655,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
4656,3,16,Kenny McCormick,[seeing the red streak] (Woohoo! [jumps for joy] Woohoooo!)
4657,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's."
4658,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people. [drops the Breeze and picks up the Plug-Ups. Softly] Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm. [swaps the Plug-Ups for the Cotton Cork] Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh. [swaps the Cotton Cork for the Beaver Dam] Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!"
4659,3,16,Kenny McCormick,"[rushes in] (You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)"
4660,3,16,Eric Cartman,[pleased] You did?
4661,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"You got your period too, Kenny?"
4662,3,16,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)"
4663,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve. [Stan shrugs, but looks worried] But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear."
4664,3,16,Kenny McCormick,[exults] (Woo-hoo!)
4665,3,16,Netzel,"[from the TV] Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus. [a man holds up a sign saying: ""It's the end of the MILLENIUM. Please don't kill us JESUS"". Jesus looks in wonder]"
4666,3,16,Rancher,"[holding a Bible] Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!"
4667,3,16,Jesus Christ,"[sighs heavily] Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. [a flash of light and swirling clouds follow as Jesus comes forward to meet his father]"
4668,3,16,God,"[voice-over] What is it, my child?"
4669,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!"
4670,3,16,God,"Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival."
4671,3,16,Jesus Christ,"It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you."
4672,3,16,God,"Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me."
4673,3,16,Jesus Christ,"But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback."
4674,3,16,God,"Be ye careful of pride, Jesus."
4675,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30."
4676,3,16,God,"I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself."
4677,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, can I talk to you? [sits down next to Ike]"
4678,3,16,Ike Broflovski,"Uh ar, stufid."
4679,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!"
4680,3,16,Ike Broflovski,Whoa won toooo-reeee.
4681,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore."
4682,3,16,Ike Broflovski,No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.
4683,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little."
4684,3,16,Ike Broflovski,Cokeh mocker.
4685,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[stands and moves out] Thanks a lot, Ike!"
4686,3,16,Stan Marsh,So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
4687,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?"
4688,3,16,Kenny McCormick,(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
4689,3,16,Eric Cartman,Tampon? What's a tampon?
4690,3,16,Kenny McCormick,"(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)"
4691,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Ew, doesn't that hurt?"
4692,3,16,Kenny McCormick,(A little.)
4693,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[rushes up quite excited] You guys! I got my period, too!"
4694,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Wow, cool!"
4695,3,16,Stan Marsh,[frightened] You did?
4696,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! [Stan looks down sadly] I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place."
4697,3,16,Eric Cartman,"All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this ""Women Who Run With The Wolves"" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers."
4698,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,Awesome! We get powers?
4699,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve! [Stan is left alone, but Cartman returns] Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. [walks away]"
4700,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan [He sets his pencil down and goes to bed]"
4701,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!"
4702,3,16,Phillip,"[a rooster crows] Oh God, you're smelly!"
4703,3,16,Announcer,"Good morning, South Park, it's 8 a.m., [Stan awakens] and only two more days until the new millennium! [Stan moves towards the radio, than away from it, then hides under the covers, then sprints for the restroom. Quickly, he lowers his pajamas and briefs]"
4704,3,16,Stan Marsh,Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
4705,3,16,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, honey, what's the matter?"
4706,3,16,Stan Marsh,[sobbing] I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
4707,3,16,Sharon Marsh,"Well, that's good, honey."
4708,3,16,Stan Marsh,"No it's not! It's terrible! [Sharon looks worried. Stan returns to his bed and prays] Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon."
4709,3,16,Jimbo Kern,Here he comes!
4710,3,16,Mr Garrison,He's coming out!
4711,3,16,Jesus Christ,"[steps out and closes the door] ...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium. [the crowd cheers and jumps for joy] I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded! [more cheering and jumping] So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! [...silence]"
4712,3,16,Man,"...We knew you could do it, Jesus! [the crowd begins to cheer again, and Jesus grins]"
4713,3,16,Mr Garrison,"Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas! [hurries away]"
4714,3,16,Fr Maxi,"[beings to sing. Others step aside]
For he is Savior
For he is Lord"
4715,3,16,Crowd,"He gives me hope when
I have only been bored
And he lifts me up with
His gentle arm..."
4716,3,16,Eric Cartman,"[wearing a bandana and flowers] Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?"
4717,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,[with bandana and leafy wings] Here.
4718,3,16,Eric Cartman,Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
4719,3,16,Kenny McCormick,"[with fine pendant on his hood and purple cape] (Dammit, here!)"
4720,3,16,Eric Cartman,"And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool."
4721,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde."
4722,3,16,Kenny McCormick,"(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)"
4723,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first."
4724,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
4725,3,16,Eric Cartman,"What's the matter, Kyle?"
4726,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Nothing. Um [clears his throat], my period is really uuuh... [Cartman looks on skeptically] Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly."
4727,3,16,Eric Cartman,"...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too."
4728,3,16,Kenny McCormick,(And mine too.)
4729,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,[sighs] Phew.
4730,3,16,Chef,"[opens the door] Oh, hello Stan."
4731,3,16,Stan Marsh,"[despondent] Hey, Chef."
4732,3,16,Chef,How's it going?
4733,3,16,Stan Marsh,Bad.
4734,3,16,Chef,Why bad?
4735,3,16,Stan Marsh,Can I come in?
4736,3,16,Chef,"Well, sure. [Stan enters and Chef closes the door. They sit on the sofa] Now, what's the matter, little cracker?"
4737,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't."
4738,3,16,Chef,"OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly."
4739,3,16,Stan Marsh,No.
4740,3,16,Chef,"Your little girlfriend, Wendy."
4741,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't."
4742,3,16,Chef,"Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?"
4743,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Cartman told us."
4744,3,16,Chef,"Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. [gets up and faces him]"
4745,3,16,Stan Marsh,Okay.
4746,3,16,Chef,"Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?"
4747,3,16,Stan Marsh,"[thinks] ...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time."
4748,3,16,Chef,...Is that what I said?
4749,3,16,Stan Marsh,"But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! [hops off and heads out the door.]"
4750,3,16,Chef,Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
4751,3,16,Agent,"I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock."
4752,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God."
4753,3,16,Agent,"Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now. [some double doors open, and a nurse wheels Rod into the room]"
4754,3,16,Rod Stewart,Hullo-o-o.
4755,3,16,Jesus Christ,"[surprised, but quickly recovers and shakes Rod's hand] Hey, Rod, great to see you."
4756,3,16,Rod Stewart,Oh.
4757,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!"
4758,3,16,Rod Stewart,Pooped pants.
4759,3,16,Jesus Christ,What?
4760,3,16,Rod Stewart,Pooped pants.
4761,3,16,Jesus Christ,Poo pants?
4762,3,16,Rod Stewart,Pooped 'nmuh pants.
4763,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Uh, you pooped your pants?"
4764,3,16,Rod Stewart,Pooped in my pants.
4765,3,16,Jesus Christ,Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
4766,3,16,Nurse,"Again?! [turns Rod around to wheel him away] Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie? [exits with Rod. Jesus can only look on, shocked]"
4767,3,16,Dr Mephesto,"[leading Stan into the lab] Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one."
4768,3,16,Stan Marsh,But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
4769,3,16,Dr Mephesto,Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
4770,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad."
4771,3,16,Dr Mephesto,Your father never went through puberty?
4772,3,16,Stan Marsh,"No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself."
4773,3,16,Dr Mephesto,"Oh, I can't say that I blame him."
4774,3,16,Stan Marsh,So do you know anything that can help him?
4775,3,16,Dr Mephesto,"Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones."
4776,3,16,Stan Marsh,Hormones? [smiles. Mephesto takes him to the medicine cabinet]
4777,3,16,Dr Mephesto,"Yes! [removes a bottle of PURE HORMONES] Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me."
4778,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! [walks away with the bottle]"
4779,3,16,Dr Mephesto,My pleasure. I just love helping people.
4780,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. [tips the bowl towards Kyle, who reaches in and takes a slip of paper]"
4781,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[unfurls and reads] Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh- [thump. The three look up]"
4782,3,16,Stan Marsh,"[outside, below] Hey assholes! [the three rise and head for a window]"
4783,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet."
4784,3,16,Stan Marsh,[now with some facial hair] Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
4785,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,Hormones?
4786,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!"
4787,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones."
4788,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew."
4789,3,16,Stan Marsh,So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
4790,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go."
4791,3,16,Stan Marsh,[voice breaking] Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. [walks away. The other three withdraw and resume their discussion]
4792,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-"
4793,3,16,Kenny McCormick,(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.) [leans forward in pain]
4794,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-"
4795,3,16,Kenny McCormick,(Oh- ooowww!)
4796,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!"
4797,3,16,Kenny McCormick,(Aaaaaa!) [falls back and passes out. Blood spews up from his mouth]
4798,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
4799,3,16,Dr Doctor,Mr. and Ms. McCormick.
4800,3,16,McCormick Parents,Yes?
4801,3,16,Dr Doctor,I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.
4802,3,16,Ms McCormick,"[sobbing] Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it."
4803,3,16,Dr Doctor,We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.
4804,3,16,Stuart McCormick,"What happened? What killed him, doctor?"
4805,3,16,Dr Doctor,"Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank."
4806,3,16,Ms McCormick,[sobbing] Oh my God.
4807,3,16,Dr Doctor,My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.
4808,3,16,Ms McCormick,[sobbing] Gi-ih [gulp]
4809,3,16,Dr Doctor,"We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show."
4810,3,16,Stuart McCormick,Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?
4811,3,16,Netzel,"Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me. [tents and stands pepper the grounds. Some of them have been seen in South Park before] It looks as though Jesus really has come through. [Jesus is in his room looking at the report] Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event."
4812,3,16,Jesus Christ,[shocked] What??
4813,3,16,Netzel,"How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?"
4814,3,16,Ma am,[in party hat] Of course he is. This is Jesus we're talking about. He wouldn't let us down.
4815,3,16,Jesus Christ,"[turns off the TV] Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow? [no answer] ...Hello?"
4816,3,16,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley. [Stan awakes. A beard is forming] Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. [he jumps out of bed and walks past a Terrance and Phillip full-length mirror. He stops, walks backwards, and looks at his reflection, strokes his sparse beard, turns to look at himself from the side...]"
4817,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs."
4818,3,16,Eric Cartman,"[walks in with Kyle] Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. [Jesus takes the stage and speaks]"
4819,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?! [the crowd roars. Jesus steps backstage and prays] Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it."
4820,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[Butters is already next to Cartman] Hey, here comes Stan."
4821,3,16,Stan Marsh,"[walks up, with a deep boy voice] Have I missed anything?"
4822,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there."
4823,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Did you get your period yet, Stan?"
4824,3,16,Stan Marsh,"No. I didn't, but-"
4825,3,16,Eric Cartman,"Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. [he and Kyle walk off]"
4826,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod ""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"" Stewart! [the curtains open as Jesus steps aside. The nurse rolls Rod up to the mic and walks away as the band plays. The crowd has no reaction. The band pauses after a while, so Rod can sing]"
4827,3,16,Rod Stewart,"O-o-oh. [the band riffs a bit] O-oh. [the band plays on. Jesus keeps time] O-o-o-oh. Be-eh-o-o-or. [Stan walks around and then sits on a curb, truly depressed. Rod continues to sing unintelligibly]"
4828,3,16,Jimbo Kern,"[disgusted] Whoa, man."
4829,3,16,Rod Stewart,Oh. Uh pooped 'em. [the band resumes play as the nurse brings a bucket on stage and checks him out]
4830,3,16,Mr Garrison,This sucks balls!
4831,3,16,Blonde,Yeah!
4832,3,16,Man 7,"Alright, enough of this! Bring out God!"
4833,3,16,Man 9,Yeah!
4834,3,16,Jesus Christ,Oh no.
4835,3,16,Crowd,We want God! We want God! We want God!
4836,3,16,Jesus Christ,"[""We want God""] Please, Father. Do something."
4837,3,16,Crowd,We want God!
4838,3,16,Jesus Christ,"[goes onstage again] Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight."
4839,3,16,Randy Marsh,We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
4840,3,16,Woman,"This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!"
4841,3,16,Skeeter,Let's get him! [leads the charge to the stage]
4842,3,16,Netzel,"Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as ""the gayest party ever."" Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. [behind him, two men pop in and out of view. One holds a bat, the other runs back and forth. The man with the bat beats the other man down, but the other man pops up and continues running]"
4843,3,16,Stan Marsh,"[goes onstage] Jesus, why does God hate me?"
4844,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again."
4845,3,16,Stan Marsh,He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
4846,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you."
4847,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?"
4848,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life."
4849,3,16,Stan Marsh,What do you mean?
4850,3,16,Jesus Christ,"If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems. [becomes reflective] A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence. [realizes something] That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party."
4851,3,16,Stan Marsh,I just wanted my period.
4852,3,16,Jesus Christ,"I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own. [Skeeter and five other men bring a large cross in] I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. [a bright light appears in the sky and descends towards the stage. The crowd gapes in awe]"
4853,3,16,Man,"Whoa, what is that??"
4854,3,16,Jesus Christ,[the light approaches him] It's Dad.
4855,3,16,Fr Maxi,God? God is going to show himself??
4856,3,16,Woman,"Look, I can see him. [the light begins to bathe the crowd]"
4857,3,16,Jesus Christ,Father. You came.
4858,3,16,God,"Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me. [now the crowd is shocked] Be ye not afraid. [God is shown as some kind of short-legged squirrel, elephant, cat, hippopotamus hybrid] Blessed art thou, my children. [a man's party blower falls from his lips]"
4859,3,16,Randy Marsh,That's God?
4860,3,16,Jesus Christ,"Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega. [a snake's tongue lashes out from God's mouth] The Beginning and the End."
4861,3,16,Mr Garrison,"Well, yeah, but that??"
4862,3,16,God,"What did you expect me to look like, My son?"
4863,3,16,Mr Garrison,[thinks a moment] ...Well not like that!
4864,3,16,God,"Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question."
4865,3,16,Gerald Broflovski,[next to Mr. Mackey] One question?
4866,3,16,Mr Mackey,Only one?
4867,3,16,Sharon Marsh,What should we ask him?
4868,3,16,Chef,"We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, ""What's the meaning of life?"" or ""Why are we here?""."
4869,3,16,Stan Marsh,I have it. I have the question. [steps forth] Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! [the crowd stands aghast]
4870,3,16,God,"[after a while] My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it."
4871,3,16,Kyle Broflovski,[exposed] How do know that?
4872,3,16,God,"You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man — with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven. [transforms into the light and returns the way he came]"
4873,3,16,Mr Garrison,"Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??"
4874,3,16,God,"I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000. [zips away]"
4875,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! [people look at him, annoyed] Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay. [looks around] I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
[end credits roll]
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne..."
4876,3,16,Skeeter,Let's get him.
4877,3,16,Stan Marsh,"Let's have a cup o-Aaaa! [mayhem ensues as people riot, breaking wood and glass all around. A gunshot is heard, a couple of women scream, and the rioting goes on]"
4878,3,17,Announcer,"This Saturday, Pox presents the musical event of the new millennium! You all remember playing the recorder in elementary school! [a recorder resting on a book of sheet music is shown] Well, this Saturday in Oklahoma City [its skyline is shown], over 4 million third-grade students [a crowd of them is shown] from all over the country [a school bus full of students is shown] will gather in one place, and at the same time, play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. [a girl is shown playing a white one] It's the largest third-grade recorder concert ever! [An elderly man instructs three students, one of them in a wheelchair] Special guest conductor Yoko Ono [pictured] and woodwind virtuoso Kenny G [pictured] will lead this fantastic event! This Saturday, at 11 Eastern / 10 Central. The world will be watching! [close-up of a small boy playing his recorder]"
4879,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma."
4880,3,17,Class,[groaning] Awww.
4881,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?! [raises his baton] Recorders up. [the students set their recorders between their lips] And a-1 and a-2 and a- [the class begins to play the song. Some students play slow] ""...of liberty."" You're late! [the kids play faster, but are still off] ""...my father-"" What the hell was that?! [the students lower their recorders] God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!"
4882,3,17,Eric Cartman,"That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long."
4883,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[Kenny laughs] Shut up, fatass!"
4884,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. [Kenny laughs so hard he falls off his seat]"
4885,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up. [the students set their recorders between their lips] And a-1 and a-2 and a- [the class begins to play the song. Mr. Garrison genuflects and bangs his head against his desk. Mr. Mackey walks in, looking at this behavior]"
4886,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, that sounded great, kids. [Mr. Garrison looks up at him]"
4887,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[rising] Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken."
4888,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas."
4889,3,17,Mr Garrison,[close-up. He's suddenly scared] Arkansas?
4890,3,17,Stan Marsh,What's Arkansas—is that a state?
4891,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? [hands them out. Craig reads his sheet.]"
4892,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?"
4893,3,17,Mr Mackey,M'kay. [joins Mr. Garrison aside]
4894,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me."
4895,3,17,Mr Mackey,What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
4896,3,17,Mr Garrison,[wistfully] Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my [stifles a sob] ...father still lives there.
4897,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Well, don't you want to see them?"
4898,3,17,Mr Garrison,I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
4899,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay? [walks him over to a chair and sits him down] Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?"
4900,3,17,Mr Garrison,"...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me."
4901,3,17,Mr Mackey,When was that?
4902,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—"
4903,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy? [Mr. Garrison begins to cry] Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?"
4904,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[turns away] Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! [hurries out of the classroom crying]"
4905,3,17,Eric Cartman,That was pretty cool.
4906,3,17,Mr Mackey,M'kay.
4907,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[with recorder] Okay, how about this one, Kenny? [plays an A note]"
4908,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(Uh-uh.)
4909,3,17,Eric Cartman,No? How about this? [plays a G note]
4910,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(Nope.)
4911,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? [plays a Gb note. Kyle and Stan turn around on their seat]"
4912,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
4913,3,17,Eric Cartman,"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control."
4914,3,17,Stan Marsh,"What's ""lose bowel control?"""
4915,3,17,Eric Cartman,That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
4916,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!"
4917,3,17,Eric Cartman,Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
4918,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Nuh-uh!
4919,3,17,Eric Cartman,"How about this one, Kenny? [plays an F note]"
4920,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh-uh.)
4921,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"There is no brown noise, fat boy!"
4922,3,17,Eric Cartman,That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
4923,3,17,Stan Marsh,Who's Karen Carpenter?
4924,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Aaaaaah! [apparently, he's seen a sign that reads: ""Arkansas 410 miles. Rest Stop 5 miles""] Huhh, ohh, [the students and Mr. Mackey look back.]"
4925,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Mr. Garrison, are you alright?"
4926,3,17,Mr Hat,Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.
4927,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?"
4928,3,17,Mr Hat,"Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!"
4929,3,17,Mr Mackey,M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
4930,3,17,Mr Hat,"No! No, you moron! [Mr. Mackey gets annoyed] Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!"
4931,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!"
4932,3,17,Mr Hat,Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
4933,3,17,Mr Mackey,What did you say?!
4934,3,17,Mr Hat,"You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!"
4935,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Why, you son of a bitch! [rips Mr. Hat from Mr. Garrison's hand and starts beating him up. Mr. Hat smacks Mr. Mackey down in front of Terrence, who looks aghast]"
4936,3,17,Stan Marsh,Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. [the other students turn to see the fight]
4937,3,17,Mr Mackey,"I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?! [resumes fighting Mr. Hat]"
4938,3,17,Students,[cheering] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
4939,3,17,Ms Crabtree,BE QUIET BACK THERE!
4940,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Yuh-NO! [panting, dirty and black-eyed, gets up and places Mr. Hat between Mr. Garrison's arms] You may have won this time, Mr. Hat."
4941,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!"
4942,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"[a female with clipboard, walking up] School?"
4943,3,17,Mr Mackey,Excuse me?
4944,3,17,Concert Coordinator,What school are you from?
4945,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?"
4946,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York. [distracted by something away from the bus] Nono, don't put the Florida kids in the building! [moves away. The class walks past the New York children]"
4947,3,17,Tough Guy 1,[sitting on the bus's front right fender] Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
4948,3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, huh? [they begin to snicker as the South Park kids look back]"
4949,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Whoa, look at this kid's coat. [Kenny's] Ey, kid. What's the matter—you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What? [the others laugh]"
4950,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[aside, to Stan] Who the hell are these guys?"
4951,3,17,Tough Guy 1,I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
4952,3,17,Stan Marsh,We're not rednecks!
4953,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!"
4954,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?! [the other New Yorkers laugh]"
4955,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[aside, to Stan, softly] Stan, what's a queef?"
4956,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny?
4957,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know!)
4958,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!"
4959,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!"
4960,3,17,Black kid,"[wearing EKKO shirt] Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?!"
4961,3,17,Eric Cartman,Aaaa-
4962,3,17,Stan Marsh,Why?! Don't you know?!
4963,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
4964,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, dickhole! [feedback is heard, and all look to the source]"
4965,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"[on bullhorn] I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in."
4966,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"[as South Park leaves] Yeah see ya later, queefs! [at least Stan and Kyle are pissed off. They look angry as they look at each other]"
4967,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! [drops his book]"
4968,3,17,Stan Marsh,[reading another book] Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
4969,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, let's try the dictionary. [picks it up] queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef."
4970,3,17,Stan Marsh,Damnit! [closes his book]
4971,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[reading another book, jumps for joy] Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!"
4972,3,17,Stan Marsh,You did? [the other three gather around]
4973,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
4974,3,17,Eric Cartman,"I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise."""
4975,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Awwgh!
4976,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Damnit Cartman, wha-?!"
4977,3,17,Eric Cartman,"""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?"
4978,3,17,Stan Marsh,Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! [he and the other two return to their books and read on]
4979,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[on the walkway, sighs] I can do this. I have to do this. [approaches the door and rings the bell. His father answers] Hello. Dad."
4980,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Oh, hello, son."
4981,3,17,Mr Garrison,Can I ...come in?
4982,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Ub. Sure, of course. [Mr. Garrison enters] Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?"
4983,3,17,Mr Garrison,"No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did."
4984,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, what?"
4985,3,17,Mr Garrison,"I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things."
4986,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, okay, like what?"
4987,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it! [sighs] I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!"
4988,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,What??
4989,3,17,Mr Garrison,I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this!
4990,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
4991,3,17,Mr Garrison,I know! I wanna know why not?!
4992,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,WHAT??
4993,3,17,Mr Garrison,Was it that I was ugly?!
4994,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Oh, my God! [turns around]"
4995,3,17,Mr Garrison,"I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!"
4996,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, NO!! [walks away, but his son rushes up to grab him]"
4997,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! [runs off crying. Mr. Garrison Sr. can only express shock.]"
4998,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"[Onstage] Alright, everyone, quiet please! There are over 4 million of you, so we must have quiet! At this time I would like to introduce the woman who is making this all possible, Yoko Ono! [motions for Yoko to enter]"
4999,3,17,Yoko Ono,"Please [orates 20 seconds of incomprehensible, imitation, Japanese-accented English]... sing song ""My Country 'Tis of Thee."""
5000,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes."
5001,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means."
5002,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means."
5003,3,17,Stan Marsh,"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em."
5004,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
5005,3,17,Stan Marsh,What word could we make up?
5006,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,How about... finkleroy?
5007,3,17,Stan Marsh,"No, uhno, not finkleroy."
5008,3,17,Eric Cartman,"How about geebo, or, or mung?"
5009,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, mung."
5010,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Mung's good.
5011,3,17,Stan Marsh,Sh. Here they come. [the New Yorkers arrive]
5012,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?"
5013,3,17,Stan Marsh,You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
5014,3,17,Tough Guy 2,We're not mung. You're mung.
5015,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?"
5016,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Of course we know what mung means!
5017,3,17,Athlete,"Yeah, D'ya think we wouldn't know what mung means? [Stan laughs, then Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny join in]"
5018,3,17,Stan Marsh,We busted you!
5019,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! [they resume laughing]
5020,3,17,Tough Guy 1,You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
5021,3,17,Stan Marsh,[the boys stop laughing] It is?
5022,3,17,New Yorkers,[behind the two toughs and two others] Yeah. [they turn around]
5023,3,17,Athlete,It sure is.
5024,3,17,New Yorker 1,Yeah.
5025,3,17,New Yorker 2,Uh huh. [turns around]
5026,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
5027,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,[winces] Eewww.
5028,3,17,Stan Marsh,Ooogh.
5029,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"You guys didn't know that? [the rest of the New Yorkers turn around and they all laugh. Then, the rest of the 4 million+ kids laugh with them] Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'! [they leave. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny turn on Cartman]"
5030,3,17,Stan Marsh,"You dumbass, Cartman!"
5031,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!"
5032,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow."
5033,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about."
5034,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,About what?
5035,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[set his cup down and sighs] Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?"
5036,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,That... that can't be.
5037,3,17,Mr Garrison,"He never did, Mom, not once."
5038,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,[stands] That's not true! Your father loved you! Often!
5039,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[stands] He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!"
5040,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"[cups her ears and shuts her eyes, spilling her coffee] Nohoho! No! If I knew I would have made him do it!"
5041,3,17,Mr Garrison,You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
5042,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,I'm not listening!
5043,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Face it, Mother. He never abused me! [his mom starts to cry, and his dad enters the room carrying groceries]"
5044,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, what's goin' on?"
5045,3,17,Mr Garrison,Mother won't hear the truth!
5046,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,He says you didn't molest him as a child!
5047,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
5048,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,No! I didn't know! [cups her ears and shuts her eyes again] I'm not listening!
5049,3,17,Mr Garrison,"You can't close your eyes forever, Mother! [she walks away, crying] Mother, wait! [runs after her. Again, Mr. Garrison Sr. is shocked]"
5050,3,17,Yoko Ono,"[Speaks in imitation, harshly thick, Japanese-accented English] Alright people, how many people has a copy. We must have-a practiced the ... song for the performance tomorrow, please."
5051,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here."
5052,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise."
5053,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
5054,3,17,Yoko Ono,"And-a one gop seven to-sand ... [the children begin to play, and she covers her ears in agony] O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?!"
5055,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is that lady talking about?
5056,3,17,Stan Marsh,I have no idea.
5057,3,17,Mr Mackey,"[bends down and looks in] Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.?"
5058,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Thuh, that's me."
5059,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay."
5060,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,[slides out and rises] What can I do for ya?
5061,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay."
5062,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!"
5063,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Eh, you didn't?"
5064,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
5065,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different."
5066,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him."
5067,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about ""sexual molestation"", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality."
5068,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,I didn't do it because it's wrong!
5069,3,17,Mr Mackey,"I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him."
5070,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year old son?!
5071,3,17,Mr Mackey,"There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, ""How far will I go to save my son's life?"""
5072,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, I won't have sex with him!"
5073,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Well, I've said all I can say. [walks away, then turns] I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay? [walks away, then turns] Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison. [emphasizes each syllable] Don't lose... your son, m'kay? [walks out of the station]"
5074,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
5075,3,17,News Reporter Rick,"Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. [Mr. Garrison walks to the stairs behind his father, but stops to watch the report] It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has..."
5076,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad."
5077,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Good night. [Yoko Ono finishes rambling incoherently]
5078,3,17,News Reporter Rick,Words to live by.
5079,3,17,Mr Garrison,[pause] Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
5080,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Uh huh.
5081,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[pause] Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something."
5082,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,[flatly] Should be fine.
5083,3,17,Mr Garrison,[pause] Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
5084,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Won't be necessary.
5085,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[steps up, then turns again] I'll just... be going up to bed now. [pause] Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers."
5086,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,I'm not going to molest you!
5087,3,17,Mr Garrison,You don't love me! [runs upstairs crying] I wanna die!
5088,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"God-damnit! [pounds the arms of the chair with his fists, then rises and goes out the door.]"
5089,3,17,Stan Marsh,I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
5090,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. They think they're so cool.
5091,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[rushing into the room with Kenny wearing earmuffs] You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!"
5092,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Calm down, Cartman."
5093,3,17,Stan Marsh,You found what?
5094,3,17,Eric Cartman,"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. [places some earmuffs on Stan's head] There, okay. Let's see here. [places some earmuffs on Kyle and rushes back to his side of the room] Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?"
5095,3,17,Kenny McCormick,"(Ready.) [Stan and Kyle look at each other and Cartman plays a fat bass note. Kenny farts] (Oh, [farts] shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) [rushes away]"
5096,3,17,Stan Marsh,"[incredulous, removes his earmuffs] No way."
5097,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,[removes his earmuffs] I don't believe it!
5098,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[removes his earmuffs] Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. [leads them outside where a UPS delivery man is offloading packages, and the three put on their earmuffs. He whispers] Okay. [plays that bass note again]"
5099,3,17,Delivery Man,"[farts] Whoa- Oh, my God! [grabs his belly and lets loose a long fart] Aaww, I crapped my pants! [rushes away with a brown stain on the seat of his pants. The boys remove their earmuffs]"
5100,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,That's amazing.
5101,3,17,Eric Cartman,I told you guys!
5102,3,17,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
5103,3,17,Eric Cartman,That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
5104,3,17,Stan Marsh,No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
5105,3,17,Eric Cartman,Ooooh.
5106,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude!"
5107,3,17,Eric Cartman,"They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously."
5108,3,17,Patron 1,"Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad."
5109,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, I'm having some troubles at home."
5110,3,17,Patron 1,"Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas?"
5111,3,17,Patron 2,[with mustache] Yeah.
5112,3,17,Patron 3,"[with goatee] Yeah, that's right."
5113,3,17,Patron 1,Yeah.
5114,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?"
5115,3,17,Patron 2,Sure!
5116,3,17,Patron 3,Yeah we are!
5117,3,17,Blond,[at a table] I am. I know that.
5118,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?"
5119,3,17,Patron 1,Absolutely.
5120,3,17,Patron 2,Of course.
5121,3,17,Patron 4,"Yeah, man."
5122,3,17,Patron 5,"Come on, Garrison!"
5123,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life? [the others ponder the question]
5124,3,17,Patron 2,"...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?"
5125,3,17,Patron 1,"Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your father's life?"
5126,3,17,Arkansas Bar Patrons and Tender,"[wondering] Wooo, yeah."
5127,3,17,Patron 2,"Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him""?"
5128,3,17,Patron 1,Yeah.
5129,3,17,Patron 2,"Oh, that's a tough one."
5130,3,17,Patron 3,Hmmm.
5131,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"No no wait, uh, you don't understand."
5132,3,17,Blond,How about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life?
5133,3,17,Arkansas Bar Patrons and Tender,"No, no, no way. No."
5134,3,17,Patron 6,"But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father."
5135,3,17,Patron 7,Yeup.
5136,3,17,Patron 8,"Me, too."
5137,3,17,Patron 9,"Well, I think that goes without saying."
5138,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son."
5139,3,17,Patron 8,"Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here?"
5140,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, he doesn't have a gun."
5141,3,17,Blond,The father doesn't have a gun?
5142,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,No! Nobody's got a gun!
5143,3,17,Patron 3,"I think if someone said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son,"" but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it."
5144,3,17,Patron 2,"He could have a knife, though."
5145,3,17,Patron 1,Yeah.
5146,3,17,Patron 3,Sure.
5147,3,17,Patron 1,"Yeah, a knife."
5148,3,17,Bartender,"If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, ""Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you,"" ...I would have sex with myself."
5149,3,17,Patron 1,"...Yeah, I would [Mr. Garrison Sr. gets up and heads out the door]"
5150,3,17,Patron 2,That's right.
5151,3,17,Patron 3,Uh huh.
5152,3,17,Bartender,That makes sense.
5153,3,17,Patron 1,Mm-hm.
5154,3,17,Patron 1,Wasn't that right?
5155,3,17,Patron 3,"Mm, See?"
5156,3,17,Stan Marsh,"How do we write he note, Cartman?"
5157,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. [shows it to them on his book]"
5158,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. [makes the change] Come on. [the boys leave their room again and head for the New York room.] There. [tapes the music to the door. Kyle sticks a small yellow Post-It note saying ""Revised Music for Tomorrow"" onto the music] That should do it."
5159,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys."
5160,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Okay, let's get back to the room. [the three walk off]"
5161,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"[arrives and sees the change] What's this?? [looks more closely at it] ""Revised Music for Tomorrow""?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow??"
5162,3,17,Chip,What??
5163,3,17,Concert Coordinator,Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry! [hurries away.]
5164,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[sighs, then softly] Dad? [the door opens to reveal his dad's shadow.] Pop, I'm just fast asleep—I'm not hearing anything. [the shadow moves closer and closer...]"
5165,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[ecstatic] Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!"
5166,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[well-rested and confident] Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon."
5167,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?"
5168,3,17,Mr Garrison,"No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have."
5169,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again."
5170,3,17,Mr Garrison,"We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to."
5171,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son."
5172,3,17,Mr Garrison,"I will. [hugs each parent] Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! [turns and heads cheerfully out the door] Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face..."
5173,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"You did the right thing, Poppa."
5174,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"I didn't do squat! [goes inside and opens a door behind which is Kenny G] Here you go, a hundred bucks. [hands Kenny G the money]"
5175,3,17,Kenny G,"Oh, that's okay. Keep your money. Thanks. [walks out and away]"
5176,3,17,Announcer,"Live, from Oklahoma City! [its skyline is shown] Four million third-grade students [a crowd of them is shown] from all over the country [a school bus full of students is shown] playing ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders... ""MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE"" special."
5177,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants."
5178,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
5179,3,17,Kenny G,Are we all ready to play? [almost whispering] Thanks. Okay. [loudly] Let's see the music! [the music pops up on the stage wall]
5180,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,This is gonna be sweet!
5181,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, dude. Look! [the projected  music is shown] It's the music we changed! [the camera zooms in on the changed note]"
5182,3,17,Eric Cartman,Uh-oh. [Kenny finally shows up]
5183,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-"
5184,3,17,Yoko Ono,"One, two, sign paytah. [Kenny G starts the tune, then the children join in]"
5185,3,17,Stan Marsh,No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
5186,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
5187,3,17,Kenny McCormick,No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
5188,3,17,Eric Cartman,No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
5189,3,17,Stan Marsh,Stop! Stop! [he and the other three are near the stage...]
5190,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Uh, aren't those our boys?"
5191,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Oh, no. What are they doing?"
5192,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]"
5193,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]"
5194,3,17,Kenny McCormick,"Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]"
5195,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]"
5196,3,17,News Reporter Rick,"[soberly] Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick?"
5197,3,17,News Reporter Rick,"[A cleanup crew is shown at work, and the camera pans over to the reporter] Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere. [the stage and the lot are bare, except for poop everywhere] Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some [Kenny lies dead with rats nibbling on him] crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, ""How did this happen?"" [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk by, whistling]"
5198,3,17,Kenny G,"Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well."
5199,3,17,Yoko Ono,"[Chattering quickly in comical Asian-accented English] Wery well?! Wery well?! You're gonna be on Ricki Lake, I tell you again! Look at ad a bah godda circada she doin wery well?!"
5200,3,17,Mr Mackey,"[the school buses are ready to take all the third graders back to their homes] Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come into view and stop]"
5201,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, that whole experience sure did suck."
5202,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. [Kyle and Cartman grin]"
5203,3,17,Mr Mackey,"[passing by behind them] Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. [the boys look afraid to know]"
5204,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
5205,3,17,Tough Guy 1,[stopping by with two others] Here they are!
5206,3,17,Tough Guy 2,Yeah!
5207,3,17,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here."
5208,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
5209,3,17,Stan Marsh,Uuuuh...
5210,3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, we knows all about it!"
5211,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, no!"
5212,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool."
5213,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
5214,3,17,Stan Marsh,You do?
5215,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shit themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!"
5216,3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry."
5217,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?"
5218,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Yeah. See you guys later. [the three New Yorkers leave]
5219,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus. [the boys get on and Kenny G stops by] Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G."
5220,3,17,Kenny G,"Huhuh, good- good-bye. [hugs and kisses him]"
5221,3,17,Mr Garrison,"M-m-m. [Kenny G releases and walks away] Oh, well, thank you! [steps towards the bus, then stops] You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad. [steps into the bus and faces the driver] Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home."
5222,3,17,Ms Crabtree,Which way should we go?
5223,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. [Ms. Crabtree starts the bus and drives as day fades into night. It goes over a rise and blinks out of view.]"
