0,17,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this [holds his hand out], and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!"
1,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to them, talking to someone on the phone via speaker] Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life."
2,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),How many hours were you guys playing?
3,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"""
4,17,1,Kyle Broflovski,AAAARGH!
5,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),You were playing football?
6,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?"
7,17,1,Kyle Broflovski,That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
8,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[softly, covering the phone] Kyle, this is a private conversation."
9,17,1,Kyle Broflovski,Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
10,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),Is that that same kid?
11,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls."
12,17,1,Kyle Broflovski,How do we have a choice?!
13,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?"
14,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),"Yeah yeah, you said that."
15,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),My dad says the government keeps a database on everyone.
16,17,1,Eric Cartman,Who is that? Is that Toby
17,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),Yeah.
18,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?"
19,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),"Yeah, we're ditching school."
20,17,1,Eric Cartman,"You're what? What, you say?"
21,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),Me and Toby are ditching school!
22,17,1,Eric Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore! [he's not talking to his friends at the table, but to his friends on the conference call] Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""?"
23,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),I don't think so.
24,17,1,Eric Cartman,"See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! [Kyle takes the top bun off his burger]"
25,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),That'd be cool.
26,17,1,Eric Cartman,That'd be what?
27,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),That'd be COOL.
28,17,1,Eric Cartman,"I know, right? [Kyle puts the bun back on the burger, then takes his tray with him and walks away] A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages! [having lost his appetite, Kyle throws his food away, puts his tray on the nearby cart, and walks off. Cartman approaches the trash can] I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now. [carelessly throws his trash away, with fries spilling onto the floor, puts his tray carelessly on the card, then walks off behind Kyle] I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know? [Kyle stops, his anger rising] Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site. [turns on the video feature on his phone and starts recording] What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret! [ends the video and goes back to his phone friends. Kyle leaves] You guys gonna update your blogs too?"
29,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?"
30,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),I said I got your tweet and the address!
31,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?"
32,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),"Yeah, I'm here, bro."
33,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. [Kyle just walks up to Cartman and stands next to him]"
34,17,1,Kyle Broflovski,[calmly] Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
35,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle! [runs off, then stops and addresses everyone on the playground] Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school"
36,17,1,Butters Stotch,Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
37,17,1,Eric Cartman,"That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? [walks away. The other kids disperse and go back to what they were doing. Only Butters and Kyle remain.]"
38,17,1,Butters Stotch,The government watches everything we do?
39,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government. [smiles, then walks to his bed and goes under the covers, then gasps] Oh yeah. [gets out of bed and goes to his mark] Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble... [a little softly] I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year. [normal] 'Night, Government. [goes back to bed]"
40,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally."
41,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),They're spying on you?
42,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?! [pounds the keyboard with his right fist. The other kids begin to star at him] This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!"
43,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),Like what?
44,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter."
45,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),"Naw, don't do that."
46,17,1,Eric Cartman,"No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna- [gets suspicious] Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence. [hides behind his monitor for a moment, then slowly stands up on his chair] I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room. [sits down] Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter."
47,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),You need that new thing where you don't need to type.
48,17,1,Eric Cartman,"What, they already have something better than Twitter?"
49,17,1,Lawrence and Toby (phone only),You haven't seen the Alec Baldwin commercial?
50,17,1,Eric Cartman,No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
51,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,"Hello. I'm Alec Baldwin, and I love social media. [whips out his phone] But sometimes, I accidentally tweet things that are homophobic. I don't think that way, I just type that way. That's when I realized it wasn't me that was homophobic, it was my thumbs, and they needed to be gotten rid of. [a shot of him chopping his right thumb off with a meat cleaver, then doing the same with his left thumb. He groans in pain each time.] So then the problem was, I don't have thumbs. But I know that everyone in America still wants to hear everything I have to say.[Now in a park by a lake. He's on a bench, with a camera behind him. He turns to look at it] Well, that's okay, because now there's a device that can actually take the thoughts in your head and send them directly to the Internet. It's called... Shitter. [points to a pair of antennae attached to the crown of his head. Next follows a stick-figure representation of the process]Wires are grafted harmlessly into your skull and any thought you have is uploaded to the Internet, and on to all your Shitter followers. [more stick figures appear, each with their own Shitter antennae. Then he's shown at a baseball park: ""I'm at a Yankess game right now."" The men on either side look at him. ""God I love baseball."" Next he's on a plane next to an elderly woman with her cat in a pet carrier. ""People who take their cats on planes should be shot."" He looks away, and the elderly woman looks at him. Next he's at a theatre. ""I'm at a really great musical right now."" The woman to his left notices the antennae. Next he's at an outdoor restaurant looking at a menu. ""In 1992 I had sex with the Queen of Monaco. I had my entire fist up her ass."" Back on set] Don't let your social media slow down our need to communicate with the world. Go direct from thought to Internet ...with Shitter. [""Just finished my Shitter commercial. Time to go find a pussy sandwich.""]"
52,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[""Alright, what's up everybody, what's up? I'm about ready to go to the NSA undercover, and see if I can expose some of those secrets."" When Cartman appears, Kyle stops. ""You can follow me on my Shitter account at #keepyourgovernmentoutofmybusinessdotcom. Wait, sh, I've gotta be careful. Kyle is here and I'm pretty sure he's tryin' to listen in.""]"
53,17,1,Kyle Broflovski,[notices the Shitter device and gets angry.] What the hell are you doing?!
54,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle. ""Kyle, if you wouldn't mind, this broadcast is for my Shitter followers only."" Clyde and Stan join them]"
55,17,1,Clyde Donovan,What's Shitter?
56,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[leans towards Clyde. ""Don't know if you've heard, but the government is actually able to monitor all our e-mails and Twitter accounts."" leans towards Clyde. ""With Shitter I don't even need a cell phone. My thoughts are sent directly to the Internet, and then to everyone else on Shitter.""]"
57,17,1,Stan Marsh,Wow.
58,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[leans towards Stan. ""Yes. Now as I infiltrate the NSA, I'll be able to broadcast everything to all my Shitter followers.""]"
59,17,1,Kyle Broflovski,You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
60,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy."
61,17,1,Clyde Donovan,How many people are on Shitter?
62,17,1,Eric Cartman,Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
63,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,"[""I'm about to sit down and eat a sandwich at this amazing deli run by two faggtots in Chelsea.""]"
64,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[""Oh cute. I'll have to try it out sometime, lol.""]"
65,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,"[""In 1982 I was at a party at Mike Douglas' house and I fucked Kim Basinger.""]"
66,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[""Wow, that's kewl. She's cute. ;) emoji""]"
67,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. [ding]"
68,17,1,Clerk,[not shown] Next!
69,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, ""If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness."" Are these people nice?"
70,17,1,Man,DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.
71,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh Jeez. [The monitor displays ""TICKET #403 WINDOWS 15"" and a small bell dings. Butters gets off his seat...] Oh God, huh... Here we go. [...and walks up to a clerk, but has no idea what to do] I yelled at a midget. [a few seconds pass by] I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was ""Pink"" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! ""Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!"" [no reaction] And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang ""My Country Tis Of Thee"" 100 times! And I watches ""America's Got Talent"" twice! What else can I do?"
72,17,1,Clerk,"Why not a thousand ""Livin' In America""s?"
73,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! [begins to walk away and launches into the song]

Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
[exits]"
74,17,1,Receptionist,Can I help you sir?
75,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?"
76,17,1,Receptionist,"All right, and your name?"
77,17,1,Eric Cartman,Bill Clinton.
78,17,1,Receptionist,"[checks her calendar on the computer] I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton."
79,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me."
80,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,"[""If you're ever in Los Angeles, be sure to look up Jennifer Love Hewitt. She can make a pussy sandwich that will give those faggots in Chelsea a run for their money""]"
81,17,1,Chief Joe,"What have you got, Patricia?"
82,17,1,Patricia,"Uh, this man says he has an interview for a job, sir?"
83,17,1,Eric Cartman,"I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work."
84,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,"[""I borrowed my brother's dick once to fuck Darryl Hannah.""]"
85,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[clears his throat as a distraction] I was um, sure that the appointment was today."
86,17,1,Chief Joe,"That's quite alright. The NSA needs all the help it can get. Come on upstairs and I'll show you around, see if you're fit for the job."
87,17,1,Pamphleteer,Hello sir. My colleague and I are going through the neighborhood and seeing if you'd like to know the Truth. [hands him a pamphlet]
88,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Sure, I love the Truth."
89,17,1,Pamphleteer,"Okay, we from uh Jehovah Witness. We Kingdom Hall Jehovah Witness, and uh, we believe, sir, that uh many people interpret the Bible it wrong."
90,17,1,Butters Stotch,Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
91,17,1,Pamphleteer,"We are, sir. We believe the, the Truth. I was once like you. I knew not what to believe, then I let my pulvy the Jehovah into the heart."
92,17,1,Butters Stotch,Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
93,17,1,Pamphleteer,"Yes, because uh Jehovah will bring judgement against all who perish like the little girl will burn in fire."
94,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?"
95,17,1,Pamphleteer,The government ih watching me?
96,17,1,Panphleteer and Colleague,Wansa?
97,17,1,Pamphleteer,He said the government ih watching us. [they turn slowly to face the street]
98,17,1,Panphleteer and Colleague,Hi now?
99,17,1,Pamphleteer,How long they been watching us?
100,17,1,Butters Stotch,Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
101,17,1,Pamphleteer,[turns to face him] I don't go to DMV. I don't have car.
102,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature? [goes and gets some booklets he picked up at the DMV. He hand them the booklets and they leaf through them] This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! [smiles and closes the door, then walks towards the kitchen]"
103,17,1,Chief Joe,"Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office."
104,17,1,Eric Cartman,Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
105,17,1,Chief Joe,"There's a lot of people working here at the NSA. Good people, people who just wanna keep America safe. Only problem is, checking all those e-mails, Twitter accounts, and surveilling all those phone calls can take a lot of manpower. [they stop at a desk]"
106,17,1,Detective Miller,Hey Joe?
107,17,1,Chief Joe,"Whatchoo got, Miller."
108,17,1,Detective Miller,"Got a 24-year-old male in Albuquerque. He just e-mailed his wife and asked if she could go to the store after work. Then he called the fitness center to set up a membership. He liked the fitness center, so he tweeted his friends that they should try it out."
109,17,1,Chief Joe,"...Alright, keep an eye on them. Let me know if anything changes. [he and Cartman move on]"
110,17,1,Detective Miller,Will do.
111,17,1,Chief Joe,"It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone. [they go further into the office to reveal a large room with over a hundred detectives all at their desks keeping tabs on everyone else.] Sergeant! What have you got, Larson."
112,17,1,Sergeant Larson,"Got a seventeen-year-old female down in Jacksonville. She called her friend and asked her if she wanted to see the Percy Jackson movie. Then she e-mailed her mom at work and asked if it was okay. The mom said yes, but called her husband first to make sure there weren't any dinner plans."
113,17,1,Chief Joe,"Alright, keep an eye on all three of them."
114,17,1,Sergeant Larson,"Will do. [Joe and Cartman walk a few steps, then turn around. Behind them is the other half of the large room.]"
115,17,1,Chief Joe,"If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man."
116,17,1,Detective Miller,"Sir, you might wanna check this out."
117,17,1,Chief Joe,What have you got?
118,17,1,Detective Miller,Thirty-two-year-old pizza delivery man. He just put it on his Twitter account that he hates America and wants to blow up the Lincoln Memorial. [long pause]
119,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[""Four sixteen pm. The chief asked me to join him as he went to question the possible suspects. I agreed to go along. Hopefully, the NSA has no idea of my secret intentions."" The chief looks at him. ""lol."" The chief focuses on the road again. Moments later they stop in front of a house and get out of the car. The chief knocks on the door and a hippie answers it.]"
120,17,1,Hippie,"Well well, the NSA. I should've known."
121,17,1,Chief Joe,We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.
122,17,1,Hippie,"Hey man, I was just blowin' smoke. Say, what right does the government have reading my private e-mails anyway?! Haven't you squares heard of the Constitution?"
123,17,1,Chief Joe,"Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I can guarantee you."
124,17,1,Hippie,Yeah? What's that?
125,17,1,Chief Joe,You won't care who's checkin' your Twitter account then. [holds up a hard copy of the delivery man's tweets.]
126,17,1,Hippie,...I never thought of it that way.
127,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,"[""I fucked Jack Lemmon's makeup girl in a Port-A-Potty. Woops."" The chief notices the lights on Cartman's Shitter device but doesn't say anything.]"
128,17,1,Terrance (voicover),Hey Phillip! Pull my finger! [the doorbell rings and he gets up to answer it] Aaaahahahaha. [he opens the door and sees Butters with the two Polynesian women]
129,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?"
130,17,1,Craig Tucker,...The truth about what?
131,17,1,Butters Stotch,We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
132,17,1,Craig Tucker,"...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so."
133,17,1,Pamphleteer,"My colleague and I, we went to saaah experience at DMV. We went to DMV, we admit all our shortcomings an sins and uh make a tital wave of peace and serenity with the truth stored inside our heart."
134,17,1,Craig Tucker,"...Okay. [next scene, all four of them are on the sofa.]"
135,17,1,Butters Stotch,"You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?"
136,17,1,Craig Tucker,"Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no."
137,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama. [hands him a booklet] Could you read this part out lout?"
138,17,1,Craig Tucker,[slowly reading] Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
139,17,1,Butters Stotch,Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
140,17,1,Craig Tucker,I have no idea.
141,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart."
142,17,1,Pamphleteer,"Yes sir. [the boys look at her] See, i used to be like you. I go around sending them nasty e-mails and a nasty texts, puttin' nasty picture on my nasty Facebook. But then I realized, all these things, they live forever, because the government keep a file on us. So all that live forever up in what they call the Clou'. It's a government term. If they could put a file in the Clou', then I wanna make sure I come clean about the bad ones and maybe get those things off my record off the Clou'. Because we all live forever in the Clou'."
143,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh huh. [looks at Craig] Did you follow all that, Craig? [his eyes dart around] Uh, I don't think I really followed all that."
144,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[""I've done it. I've infiltrated the NSA, and gained their trust."" A shot of Alec Baldwin and his date at a buffet restaurant. The camera pans across until it reaches the couple. ""So far, I've not ascertained how they were able to keep track of everyone in the country, but I'm close. Very close. I just hope that I'm not found out as a whistleblower before I'm able to expose their entire operation.""]"
145,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,What is that voice?
146,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,Some little faggot in my head.
147,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?"
148,17,1,Detective 3,"Pretty simple. Everyone has a file. People who have a status of ""threat"", ""possible threat"", or ""person of interest"" are the ones we really wanna look at."
149,17,1,Detective 4,"The more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes."
150,17,1,Eric Cartman,Really? How big is my file?
151,17,1,Detective 4,Huh?
152,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time."
153,17,1,Detective 3,"Jarvis, what have we got on an ""Eric Cartman""? Any files on Eric Cartman."
154,17,1,Jarvis,"Ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but Central Computer designated his status as ""fat and unimportant."""
155,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet."" [no one listens. He stands up on his desk] 'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!"
156,17,1,Officer Barbrady,"And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty."
157,17,1,Clerk 2,What the? [looks over his left shoulder] Why do these people keep coming here?
158,17,1,Officer Barbrady,But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
159,17,1,Clerk 2,"Next, please! [ding]"
160,17,1,Officer Barbrady,"Thank you. [puts on his hat and walks away. Nearby is a little group Butters has been forming, and Barbrady stops by]"
161,17,1,Group,[clapping] Yaaaaaay.
162,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?"
163,17,1,Officer Barbrady,"I, I feel really good."
164,17,1,Group,"[clapping] Heehhhhhhhah. [in the waiting area, a woman peeks over a man's shoulder to see what's going on]"
165,17,1,Customer,"Wow, those people over there seem like they're havin' fun. [Barbrady hugs the colleague and shakes the pamphleteer's hand]"
166,17,1,Butters Stotch,[takes a few steps away from the group] I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance. [the group turns to face the flag] I pledge allegiance.
167,17,1,Group,"To the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [while the group recites the Pledge, the following takes place]"
168,17,1,Larry,[walks in and crosses the room towards the group] What the hell is going on here?! This is the DMV! There will be no joy here!
169,17,1,Clerk 3,Uh people keep showing up and telling us what they did wrong.
170,17,1,Customer 2,"Hey, I'm just trying to renew my license. How much longer do I gotta wait? [the group finishes the Pledge]"
171,17,1,Larry,"[faces the customer and points at him] Shut up! Sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! I'll put a stop to this! [walks to the group]"
172,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!"
173,17,1,Chief Joe,Not according to the Central Computer.
174,17,1,Eric Cartman,The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
175,17,1,Chief Joe,"Sorry, [stands and moves away from his desk] but if Central Computer says he is not a threat, then we can't do anything. [moves through the office]"
176,17,1,Eric Cartman,[runsn to catch up with the chief] Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
177,17,1,Chief Joe,There's 300 million people out there. How do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country? How do you think we're able to really know who's doing what?[they reach a pair of thick steel doors]
178,17,1,Eric Cartman,I don't know.
179,17,1,Chief Joe,"Alright, I'll show you. But this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. Then our enemies would do it. We can't let our enemies get their hands on this."
180,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Get their hands on what? [the chief presses some keys on the keypad next to the doors, and the doors open] Dude... [Santa is shown suspended in midair by a harness. Cables go from Santa to the surrounding wall of computers, and a massive one is attached to his privates. Several techs stand on a platform circling the room, looking at some of the many computers present]"
181,17,1,Chief Joe,"This is how we know who's a threat and who's not. How we know who's sleeping and who's awake. [Cartman runs away from the entrance, whips out a whistle and starts blowing it] How we know that..."
182,17,1,Eric Cartman,"You think I'm fat and unimportant now?! [rips off his fake mustache] I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!"
183,17,1,Alec Baldwin and Date,"Hi everybody, and welcome to my new show on MSNBC, ""Free Pass with Alec Baldwin"""
184,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[""Your secret is out, NSA! And now that everyone knows what you're doing to Santa you can kiss your program goodbye!""]"
185,17,1,Eric Cartman,You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
186,17,1,Liane Cartman,"Eric, honey, what's the matter?"
187,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[through his tears] It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!"
188,17,1,Liane Cartman,"I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe."
189,17,1,Eric Cartman,Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! [cries hard now]
190,17,1,Liane Cartman,"Honey, it's okay."
191,17,1,Eric Cartman,"It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! [weeps some more]"
192,17,1,Liane Cartman,"No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon."
193,17,1,Eric Cartman,I do toooo!
194,17,1,Liane Cartman,"No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?"
195,17,1,Eric Cartman,"Okaaay. [she walks out and Cartman calms down] I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon."
196,17,1,Liane Cartman,"Okay, hon."
197,17,1,Butters Stotch,Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
198,17,1,Eric Cartman,"...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?"
199,17,1,Butters Stotch,"It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart."
200,17,1,Eric Cartman,"[walks away, then stops] It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs."
201,17,1,Butters Stotch,[steps in and approaches Cartman] It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. [gives him a DMV booklet]
202,17,1,Eric Cartman,What's this?
203,17,1,Butters Stotch,"Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes."
204,17,1,Eric Cartman,I can be forgiven?
205,17,1,Butters Stotch,Yes.
206,17,1,Eric Cartman,For everything bad I've ever done?
207,17,1,Butters Stotch,Yes!
208,17,1,Eric Cartman,And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
209,17,1,Butters Stotch,That's right.
210,17,1,Eric Cartman,[wipes his forhead and sniffs] Thta's pretty kewl.
211,17,1,Butters Stotch,"We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!"
212,17,1,Eric Cartman,"I do, I love my country!"
213,17,1,Butters Stotch,Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
214,17,1,Eric Cartman,I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
215,17,1,Butters Stotch,Hallelujah!
216,17,1,Group,Yaaaaay!
217,17,1,Paul,"Do you want us to kick them out of here, Lar?"
218,17,1,Larry,"No... No, leave them alone. It's a nice change to see people happy here at the DMV. [Organ music fades out] Perhaps we here at the DMV can start changing as well. Perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope. Why, the DMV can be a place where people come to get things off their chests. Confess, yes, but also be told that they're worth something in this world! And then, DMVs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe. And when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness! Don't you see what this could lead to? Don't you see what we could become??"
219,17,1,News Anchor,"The DMV was shut down today after rampant allegations of sex with young boys. [in the picture over his shoulder are a bunch of DMV workers in handcuffs being led away by police. Four boys stand together nearby, naked and crying, with their hands over their privates.] The heads of the DMV were arrested and the director stated, quote: Hey, it came with the territory. With the DMV shut down, Americans have been asked to confess all wrongdoings at their nearest post office. [an arm appears and gives the anchorman a sheet of paper, then retracts] We've just received word that the US Postal service has been shut down due to rampant allegations of sex with young boys. It now appears that the only people who can be trusted with confessions and guidance is your local news station. WMZ News will be back in... a young boy."
220,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,[reading from her yellow index cards] Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
221,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Boooo! [Wendy looks up and gets angry] Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!"
222,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,[returns to her report] Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
223,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy."
224,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[returns to her report, with her voice clearly getting more annoyed and explicit] The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-"
225,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo! [Wendy lowers her report down to her sidee-] Boo Wendy! Liar!"
226,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!"
227,17,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo."
228,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please? [no reaction - he's rather engrossed in the book he's reading] Mr. Garrison?!"
229,17,2,Mr Garrison,"[startled] Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report, [Wendy looks betrayed] let's have uh, Peter Mullen."
230,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[extremely annoyed, goes to her seat] Ugh, Jesus! [Peter walks up and takes her place]"
231,17,2,Peter Mullen,My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes! [whips out a remote control box and presses a button. A projector screen comes down behind him] Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide! [the screen stops] I'm talking of course about [presses another button and the first image comes up. It's an Investigation Discovery screenshot] murder porn!
232,17,2,Butters Stotch,Murder porn?
233,17,2,Eric Cartman,That's more like it.
234,17,2,Peter Mullen,"According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like ""Cold Case Files,"" ""Dateline: Murder,"" and ""Deadly Affairs"" is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like ""Southern Fried Homicide,"" ""Sinful Secrets,"" ""On The Case with Paula Zahn."" And it's all smut and it's garbage and it's [throws down his index cards] trash! [a few seconds later he clears his throat and gathers up his index cards] Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, ""If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?"" [the class is speechless with mouths open. Only Cartman claps]"
235,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud. [some low rumbles are heard] Come on it. [Stan goes in. Randy is in his most relaxed pose in bed] Oh hey Stan, what's up? [Stan looks at the TV screen to his right]"
236,17,2,Narrator,"His wife is having sex with the neighbor. [a couple going at it in bed] And when her husband comes home, [the husband opens the bedroom door, the couple notices and stops.] he wants more than just a divorce. [the husband raises his gun and kills the boyfriend, than the wife. Sharon picks up the remote and switches channels]"
237,17,2,Stan Marsh,You guys are watchin' murder porn?
238,17,2,Randy Marsh,"...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show."
239,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Uh adults like documentaries.
240,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff."
241,17,2,Stan Marsh,Okaaay. [turns around and walks out. Sharon switches back to the show]
242,17,2,Randy Marsh,Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
243,17,2,Stan Marsh,What's up dude?
244,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?"
245,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Yhh, yeah, the first grader?"
246,17,2,Eric Cartman,You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
247,17,2,Stan Marsh,...What?!
248,17,2,Sergeant Yates,"Hey that kid should not be seeing this! [Aaron is still crying in despair, while  an officer drops a blanket over him so he can't see]"
249,17,2,Stan Marsh,What happened?
250,17,2,Dad,"You're making a mistake! [he is naked and covered with blood, two officers haul him towards a police cruiser, while he struggles] Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! [the officers put him in and close the back door. The boys don't believe what they've just seen]"
251,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!"
252,17,2,Red,How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!
253,17,2,Clyde Donovan,The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
254,17,2,Butters Stotch,"I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!"
255,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
256,17,2,Eric Cartman,Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
257,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know."
258,17,2,Narrator,"Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals. [a man and woman kiss. He holds a wedding ring in one hand, and a knife in the other] Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits, [a couple kisses on the front porch, then the girlfriend shots her man point blank in the forehead, smiling] on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder, [another couple. The girl stabs the guy through the left eye] on Hot Load Case Files. [a woman is ready to unload on her man and the two other women he's in bed with]"
259,17,2,Randy Marsh,Oh yeah! [he and Sharon strip down] Three of the best shows in a row!
260,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Is the lube over there?
261,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I got lube right here."
262,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"Well get over here, big guy."
263,17,2,Randy Marsh,Yeah-hah! [he moves over to her and they start making out. He leaves the lube near the edge of the bed. A three-tone chime is heard. Randy looks over and reads the screen]
264,17,2,Randy Marsh,"What the? [sits up. The lube falls off the bed] What the hell? [tries to change channels, but they all say the same thing. Moments later he's on the phone with his cable service.] Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says ""How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?"" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?"
265,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Stan. Stan! [Stan wakes up, his eyes half-closed] How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?"
266,17,2,Stan Marsh,[miffed] What?
267,17,2,Randy Marsh,What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
268,17,2,Stan Marsh,You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. [closes his eyes]
269,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid! [thinking a bit. Stan opens his eyes] I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot! [Stan closes his eyes again] Stan? [Stan opens his eyes] You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! [goes back to his room. Stan rolls his eyes and goes back to sleep]"
270,17,2,Stephen Stotch,Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
271,17,2,Mrs Tweak,How are they able to do this with their smartphones?
272,17,2,Randy Marsh,"It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company! [Stuart returns from a meeting with the cable company] What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?"
273,17,2,Stuart McCormick,"No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround."
274,17,2,Randy Marsh,"What?! We'll see about this! [storms into the office] Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!"
275,17,2,Cable Guy,"I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company. [tauntingly] Ohhh there's not another cable company, is there? [begins to rub his nipples in circles] Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town."
276,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!"
277,17,2,Cable Guy,"As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box."
278,17,2,Randy Marsh,"[relieved somewhat] Oh. Well okay, great."
279,17,2,Cable Guy,[begins to process the request on his computer] We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?
280,17,2,Randy Marsh,"NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!"
281,17,2,Cable Guy,"[begins to taunt again] Oh, you can't? [begins rubbing his nipples through his shirt] Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV?"
282,17,2,Randy Marsh,I can't afford DirecTV.
283,17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh, you can't? [rips off some patches covering his nipples off his shirt and begins rubbing his nipples directly] Jeez, that's terrible. Then I guess you just have to work within our time windows. [squeezes his nipples. Randy just glares at him and walks out]"
284,17,2,Stephen Stotch,Well? Any luck?
285,17,2,Randy Marsh,"No, just the usual cable-company stuff."
286,17,2,Mrs Tweak,"Oh well, guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama."
287,17,2,Stephen Stotch,"No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?"
288,17,2,Randy Marsh,"I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off."
289,17,2,Stephen Stotch,"We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price."
290,17,2,Boy,Hello?
291,17,2,Randy Marsh,Hi. Corey Lanskin?
292,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Yes?
293,17,2,Randy Marsh,We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
294,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Fuck off! [shuts the door on Randy. The adults are stunned and look at each other. Randy knocks on the door again, twice. Corey answers the door again, still suspicious]"
295,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!"
296,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!"
297,17,2,Randy Marsh,We have a hundred ounces of silver. [Stuart leans to his left a bit and shows off a box]
298,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"[looks right, then left, and talks in a serious British accent] Wipe your feet and turn off your cell phones. [goes inside. Randy looks back at the other adults, then wipes his shoes off on the welcome mat and goes in. The other adults wipe their shoes off and go on in.]"
299,17,2,Corey Lanskin,[pacing back and forth between the tables explaining the game] Next we're going to select an empty world. Selecting an empty world will begin with you being dropped onto a beach. Now you're free to roam around and start punching trees!
300,17,2,Gerald Broflovski,Punching trees?
301,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Why, why would we punch trees?"
302,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Just use your fucking brain! How do you get wood? [Randy isn't sure] 'Ow do you get wood?!
303,17,2,Randy Marsh,[nervously] Watching informative murder porn?
304,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!"
305,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Puh, punching trees?"
306,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin."
307,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, I see. So when does the game start?"
308,17,2,Corey Lanskin,You are playing the game; this is the game!
309,17,2,Randy Marsh,...I don't get it.
310,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!"
311,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Yes ah, I'm getting it now."
312,17,2,Gerald Broflovski,You are?
313,17,2,Randy Marsh,No.
314,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep."
315,17,2,Randy Marsh,"[at his computer playing away] I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one."
316,17,2,Sharon Marsh,I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
317,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond."
318,17,2,Sharon Marsh,We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
319,17,2,Randy Marsh,"No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?"
320,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"[settling in] Well I'm going to sleep, Randy."
321,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back."
322,17,2,Jimmy Valmer,There he is. Hey Kyle! [arrives with Craig and Tweek] The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
323,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,What? How do you know?
324,17,2,Tweek Tweak,I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
325,17,2,Craig Tucker,It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
326,17,2,Stan Marsh,That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
327,17,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys? [Stan and Kyle turn to face him. He's at the end of the hall] You guys, you'd better get over here."
328,17,2,Stan Marsh,What?
329,17,2,Eric Cartman,Butters' dad killed his mom. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in disbelief]
330,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Butters, what happened?"
331,17,2,Butters Stotch,"[through his tears] I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell!"
332,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?"
333,17,2,Butters Stotch,Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well! [Mr. Mackey happens along] I was trapped down there all night!
334,17,2,Mr Mackey,"Butters, your dad threw you down a well?"
335,17,2,Stan Marsh,In Minecraft.
336,17,2,Mr Mackey,Well what the hell is that?
337,17,2,Butters Stotch,I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
338,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,[turns left] That's it. [walks a bit] That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
339,17,2,Stan Marsh,Whattaya mean?
340,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. [dramatic flourish]
341,17,2,Randy Marsh,Yes?
342,17,2,Officer 1,"Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?"
343,17,2,Randy Marsh,"No, what happened?"
344,17,2,Officer 1,"Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees."
345,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Punched his trees, huh?"
346,17,2,Officer 1,Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
347,17,2,Randy Marsh,Huh. [puts his hands on his hips] That's weird.
348,17,2,Officer 1,What were you doing last night?
349,17,2,Randy Marsh,I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
350,17,2,Officer 2,I play the banjo too.
351,17,2,Officer 1,"Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well."
352,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Will do, officer. Will... do... [the officers turn and leave]"
353,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!"
354,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! [the kids clamor for a few seconds]"
355,17,2,Craig Tucker,"I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!"
356,17,2,Clyde Donovan,Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
357,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
358,17,2,Eric Cartman,"And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!"
359,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
360,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo."
361,17,2,Stan Marsh,"It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. [police sirens are heard]"
362,17,2,Officer 3,"All right, that's enough. Come on out and there won't be any trouble. [the kids pour out of the rec center and into some bright spotlights.] Give it up, Stotch. You've nowhere to run."
363,17,2,Butters Stotch,Huh?
364,17,2,Stephen Stotch,"I'll never give up! [the kids look up, and the next camera shows a makeshift castle built over the rec center, made of blocks of wood with pictures all over them] I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!"
365,17,2,Randy Marsh,"[steps forward carrying a large hammer] Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!"
366,17,2,Stephen Stotch,"Aw, go to hell, you griefer!"
367,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Alright, we've gotta do something."
368,17,2,Corey Lanskin,[in a trembling voice] Hello?
369,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,Corey Lanskin?
370,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Eh yes?
371,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
372,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"[sucks on his lollipop] Whaaa? What's a, what's a ""Minequaf""?"
373,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!"
374,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. ""Get back in the meat locker!"" ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"" But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?"
375,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house."
376,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Ohhhkay. [goes back inside] Bye. [closes the door. The boys turn around and leave, but Cartman stops on the walkway. A few seconds later the other three boys return]"
377,17,2,Stan Marsh,"What, dude?"
378,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Something he said. Did you hear him? He said ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"""
379,17,2,Stan Marsh,So?
380,17,2,Eric Cartman,"You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said."
381,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Now that you've built a workbench it's time to build somethin' that will take care of all those fuckin' sheep! [the boys have found the basement and come down the stairs] Just stop thinkin' with your grown-up brains and start usin' your-
382,17,2,Stan Marsh,Aha! [the boys reach the floor]
383,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Oh shit! [the adults quickly leave]
384,17,2,Kenny McCormick,(I knew you're up to something!)
385,17,2,Eric Cartman,Son of a bitch! [grabs Corey by the collar] Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
386,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Kids gotta find some way to make a livin', don't 'e?"
387,17,2,Stan Marsh,"You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!"
388,17,2,Corey Lanskin,What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?
389,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,So you know it.
390,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Yeah, I've seen that stuff. [Cartman releases him] ""'Oo The Bleep Did I Marry?"", ""True Crime with Aphrodite Jones"". Real sick shit. Your parents watch that stuff?"
391,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft."
392,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Your problem ain't with me, mates. Sure, one or two people might act out what they see in video games, but cable television? [takes out a cigarette and lighter and lights up the cigarette, then starts smoking.] People copy everything they see people do on cable. You're goin' about this all wrong. You wanna protect your family? You're gonna have to go fight the cable company."
393,17,2,Cable Guy,"Hey guys, can I help you?"
394,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please."
395,17,2,Cable Guy,"[taunting] Ohhh, you don't want cable anymore?"
396,17,2,Stan Marsh,"No no, [whips out a list and reads it] just ID Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn."
397,17,2,Cable Guy,"You don't like paying for all the channels? [begins rubbing his nipples through his shirt] Ohh, our company actually packages channels together."
398,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?"
399,17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way. [lowers his hands as if to look up something] You want me to give you the number of a different cable company that can- [goes back to rubbing his nipples] Oh wait, we're it, aren't we? [rips off the patches and rubs his nipples again] Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages."
400,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
401,17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh, sure. Hey David?"
402,17,2,David,"[arrives] Hi, is there a problem here? [rips off the patches on his shirt and prepares to rub]"
403,17,2,Stan Marsh,We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
404,17,2,David,[taunting. Both men are now rubbing their nipples] Ohhh you have to pay for the bundle. You can't just pay for what you wanna watch. Darn it.
405,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
406,17,2,Cable Guy,"I guess if you don't wanna be [lowers his left hand from his nipple so that David starts rubbing it with his right hand. He in turn begins to rub David's right nipple with his left hand] forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether."
407,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Fine, [folds his arms over his chest] then we'll shut our cable off altogether!"
408,17,2,David,Hey Mitch? When can you get out to shut off some cable boxes?
409,17,2,"Cable Guy, David, and Mitch","[at his office rubbing his nipples] Oh man, it's gonna be like three weeks. There's a whole plug I have to pull out; it's like four inches long."
410,17,2,David,"[now rubbing both of the cable guy's nipples, while the cable guy rubs his left nipple now] Three weeks, huh? Okay, is three weeks from now okay with you guys?"
411,17,2,Stan Marsh,"No, that's way too long!"
412,17,2,Cable Guy,Oh it is?
413,17,2,David,"Oh Jeez, that's terrible."
414,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other! [the men stop rubbing] Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?"
415,17,2,David,Say... say that last part again?
416,17,2,Stan Marsh,What?
417,17,2,David,Well what was the last part you said?
418,17,2,Stan Marsh,I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
419,17,2,David,"Nono, the part about your parents not getting the channels easily?"
420,17,2,Stan Marsh,I... said it would really bum them out.
421,17,2,David,How... [he and the cable guy being to rub their nipples again] How much would it bum them out?
422,17,2,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company."
423,17,2,Your Local Cable Company President,"Hello. In an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere, your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming. Customers still wishing to view true-crime networks will now need to purchase a separate package [pulls back his coat and rips some patches off his dress shirt] which will require a technician to service your cable box every night from 2 to 3 am. and must include the purchase of 300 channels in Portuguese. We realize this may be an inconvenience to you, and we hope you will voice ALL your concerns to us, because at your local cable company the customer is always... our bitch."
424,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!"
425,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad."
426,17,2,Randy Marsh,[gets up angrily from his chair] I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off! [Sharon stops washing the dishes and leaves the kitchen. Randy notices and follows her with his eyes] Oh crap.
427,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. [approaches her]"
428,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other."
429,17,2,Randy Marsh,"[puts his arms on her shoulders] No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us."
430,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?"
431,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"I'm here, Randy."
432,17,2,Randy Marsh,"It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. [presents a gem]"
433,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Diamonds. [takes them] They're beautiful
434,17,2,Randy Marsh,Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
435,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"I've got a surprise for you too, Randy."
436,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah? What's that? [Sharon whips out an axe and jams it into Randy's forehead] AAAGH! [Randy falls on his side and dies. In real life...] Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?![Sharon is smiling]"
437,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Sorry. I couldn't resist.
438,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!"
439,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Oh I did! That felt really great.
440,17,2,Randy Marsh,Felt great?
441,17,2,Sharon Marsh,[getting sensuous] Yeah...
442,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now."
443,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"Okay. [hours later, Stan comes home from school. He comes up the stairs wearing his backpack and hears his parents having a good time in their room. He walks over and goes in without knocking] Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!"
444,17,2,Randy Marsh,That felt so good!
445,17,2,Sharon Marsh,My turn again.
446,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Okay, hang on."
447,17,2,Sharon Marsh,I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
448,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now."
449,17,2,Sharon Marsh,You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! [CHUNK!]
450,17,2,Randy Marsh,"OH! Ohoho, you bitch! [Stan looks down, then turns around and walks out] Ohohunh."
451,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"Oh I love you, Randy."
452,17,2,Randy Marsh,I love you too babe. [CHUNK! She got him again] OH!
453,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey Token! [walks up to Token] What's up, bro?"
454,17,3,Token Black,Nothing.
455,17,3,Eric Cartman,"""Nothin'"" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks. [sniffs] Everything good with you?"
456,17,3,Token Black,Yeah.
457,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Sweet. [Jimmy walks over and Cartman notices him] Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?"
458,17,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Uh, I'm just gettin' ready for cla-"
459,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President. [Jimmy walks away and Token is done at his locker] About time. [Stan and Kyle stop to watch]"
460,17,3,Stan Marsh,Is he doing it again?
461,17,3,Kyle Broflovski,He's doing it a-gain.
462,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? [Token puts one last book in before closing his locker]"
463,17,3,Token Black,"I uhhh, have band practice."
464,17,3,Eric Cartman,"God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess. [makes a fist with his left hand and straightens out his arm toward Token] Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. [Token reluctantly makes a fist with his right hand and bumps Cartman's fist with it. He leaves, and Cartman moves on in a happy mood, stopping by Stan and Kyle]"
465,17,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, are you feeling alright?"
466,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I feel great. Why? [looks back] You think something's wrong? [moves on, not smiling]"
467,17,3,Herbert Garrison,"Alright, now the French Revolution was basically started by a young man named Marius. [underlines the name], who only knew Jean Valjean as an older man, and uh- [Cartman interrupts him with a grunt] ...uh, the French government at the time was led by Javert, who was trying to-"
468,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Mister! [Herbert Garrison turns around] No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt! [wakes up violently and looks bewildered. Token is stunned, and Herbert Garrison, with his arms crossed, is not pleased.] Hey Token. What's up, bro? [makes a fist and extends it towards Cartman] Fist bump? [Token is unmoved and upset]"
469,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open."
470,17,3,Eric Cartman,It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
471,17,3,Mr Mackey,And why do you think Token is a tickin' time bomb?
472,17,3,Eric Cartman,He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
473,17,3,Mr Mackey,Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
474,17,3,Eric Cartman,"But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!"
475,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?"
476,17,3,Eric Cartman,"No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse."
477,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?"
478,17,3,Eric Cartman,M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
479,17,3,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me."
480,17,3,Eric Cartman,M'kay.
481,17,3,Eric Cartman,"No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!"
482,17,3,Karin,"[serving pancakes] Eat your breakfast, girls. [turns around to put the pan back on the stove]"
483,17,3,Rachel,Where's Daddy?
484,17,3,Karin,"You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry. [the girls giggle
and the older one notices someone]"
485,17,3,Rachel,Daddy!
486,17,3,Gerry,"Good morning, girls. [walks in fully dressed, with a cup of coffee already in hand.] Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. [Karin walks over and kisses him]"
487,17,3,Karin,How did I get such a perfect husband?
488,17,3,Gerry,How did I get such a beautiful wife?
489,17,3,Rachel,"I love you, Dad."
490,17,3,Gerry,"I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally."
491,17,3,Karin,"Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other."
492,17,3,Reporter,"Today apparently will be the day! CNN has just received word that a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial is expected to come at any moment! Zimmerman is accused of shooting Trayvon Martin, and a jury will now decide his fate."
493,17,3,Constance,"Daddy, who is Trayvon Martin?"
494,17,3,Gerry,[turns around] Nobody. L-let's just get you girls to school.
495,17,3,Gerry,Is it bigger than a bread box?
496,17,3,Rachel,"What's a bread box, Dad?"
497,17,3,Constance,"Heehee, Dad is so kewl."
498,17,3,Karin,You can say that again.
499,17,3,Gerry,"[getting worried] Why aren't we moving? What's gong on? [turns on the radio to 106.7 FM and Michael Bublé's ""It's A Beautiful Day"" comes out of the speakers. The family sways along to the beat. A news report comes on the air]"
500,17,3,Reporter,"We interrupt this cool song for a news bulletin. A verdict has just been handed down in the case of George Zimmerman. In a shocking turn of events, the jury has found George Zimmerman not guilty!"
501,17,3,Gerry,"Oh my God. [fleeing white people run by his car, quickly overtaken by pissed-off black people]"
502,17,3,Reporter,"Many African-Americans are outraged by the verdict, and they are most likely about to go totally nanners. [some of them surround the car. One of them punches a window and cracks it, a second cracks the passenger window with his head, a third crawls up on the hood and breaks the windshield with his head, sticking his head inside the car]"
503,17,3,Gerry,AAAAAH!
504,17,3,Protester,"Fuck you, Brad Pitt!"
505,17,3,Gerry,"Let's bail! [steps on the gas and runs over a protester, ripping him to shreds. His car runs into another car and the protester on his hood flies off.] Everyone get out of the car! Go! [the family gets out and runs through the rioting crowd. They climb up a fire escape and onto the roof of a building, then look down over the riot. What they see is amazing: African-Americans converge and climb the side of the building in a great mass of humanity. Some of them fall back towards the street, but the mass gets closer and closer to the roof] Oh my god RUN! [they turn left and come face to face with... Token] WAAH! Token. No, Token, we had nothing to do with this. I know you're pissed off, but but be reasonable!"
506,17,3,Token Black,"Fuck you, Brad Pitt!"
507,17,3,Gerry,"No! Nonono! [Token lunges at him] Nooo! [Cartman wakes up, touches himself to make sure he's there, and chuckles nervously]"
508,17,3,Eric Cartman,Hey Token? How are you doing?
509,17,3,Token Black,I'm good.
510,17,3,Eric Cartman,That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends. [puts his left fist forward] Fist bump. [leans to his left a little] Fist bump. [Token closes his locker and hurries away]
511,17,3,Eric Cartman,"No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!"
512,17,3,Token Black,"Okay, really?"
513,17,3,Eric Cartman,No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! [wakes up]
514,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Now Eric, whatever it is you and Token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?"
515,17,3,Eric Cartman,Agreed.
516,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Okay. Token, come on in, please. [the door opens and Token walks in, closing it behind him. Token takes a seat next to Cartman]"
517,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Hoh boy, here we go."
518,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Token, I've been talkin' with Eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. You have some things you wanna say, Eric?"
519,17,3,Eric Cartman,"[after a few seconds] Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?"
520,17,3,Token Black,...What jury?
521,17,3,Eric Cartman,"This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me."
522,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Okay Token, what are your feelings about that?"
523,17,3,Token Black,"[looks at Eric for a few seconds, then answers] I don't know what to say."
524,17,3,Eric Cartman,"I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem? [pulls out his poem and begins] It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" [clears his throat]

I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?""
I was not the verdict."
525,17,3,Token Black,This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
526,17,3,Eric Cartman,"It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.

I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.

[folds his poem up and puts it away.]"
527,17,3,Token Black,Can I go back to class now?
528,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Eric, do you feel better about all this?"
529,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here."
530,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Okay, thanks Token. [Token gets up and leaves the office]"
531,17,3,Eric Cartman,It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
532,17,3,Cheerleaders,"We are Cows, proud and true! Come on, South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows!"
533,17,3,Principal Victoria,"Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song, [Nicole sits down next to Token] based on his award-winning poem, ""I Was Not The Bullet,"" with backup music by Butters Stotch. [Butters walks up, takes the mic, and starts beatboxing. Cartman walks up and starts rapping]"
534,17,3,Cartman Butters,"Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son!
James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault).
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.

White people say Ho-oh!"
535,17,3,The kids,Ho-oh.
536,17,3,Eric Cartman,Black people say He-ey! [Token and Nicole stay quiet] Cool. White people say Ho ho! [Token and Nicole begin to get mad]
537,17,3,The kids,Ho ho!
538,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Black people say Hey hey hey! [no reply] Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say ""I don't blame the white people. No no no!"""
539,17,3,Token Black,"[stands up in defiance] Alright, that's enough! [Butters stops and looks, then gets dismayed] You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!"
540,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Token, calm down."
541,17,3,Token Black,What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
542,17,3,Eric Cartman,Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! [throws his mic down and runs off]
543,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [runs inside his house] Mom it's starting! We've gotta go! [runs up to his room and opens a drawer. He rifles through it looking for something] Come on, come on! [finds a red safety box with ""BRAD PITT SURVIVAL GEAR"" printed on the lid and on the panel under the clasp. He opens it and pulls out a gun and a Brad Pitt costume. He puts the costume on, takes the gun, and runs out into the street] Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! [nearby, a couple is on their front lawn. The man is trimming bushes while his wife is shoveling snow by the front door.]"
544,17,3,Man and Woman on front lawn,Does that little boy have a gun?
545,17,3,Man and Woman on front lawn,Get inside. [drops his shears and heads for the door]
546,17,3,Man and Woman on front lawn,But-
547,17,3,Man and Woman on front lawn,"Get inside! [they both go inside. Cartman crosses the stret and a car almost runs him over, but he sidesteps the car and holds his gun out. The car stops and he gets inside]"
548,17,3,Eric Cartman,[frantically] Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
549,17,3,Tesla Driver,What's going on?!
550,17,3,Eric Cartman,Get to an airport!
551,17,3,Tesla Driver,An airport?! But...?
552,17,3,Eric Cartman,"We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! [she presses the pedal and takes off]"
553,17,3,Announcer and reporters,Now calling rows 10 through 30 for boarding.
554,17,3,Eric Cartman,The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [enters the tunnel]
555,17,3,Passenger 1,An outbreak? [covers his mouth with his sweater]
556,17,3,Passenger 2,Which one?
557,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go! [the driver rushes into the plane. Three black security guards appear] Oh my God! [closes the plane's door and locks it. The guards try to get in, but Cartman holds the handle down with all his might]"
558,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,"My God, what's going on out there?"
559,17,3,Eric Cartman,The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! [the plane takes off moments later]
560,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,Maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!
561,17,3,Eric Cartman,The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
562,17,3,Passenger 3,What contagion? My wife didn't get on the plane. [to the copilot] Take this plane back to Denver!
563,17,3,Eric Cartman,You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! [the passengers all take their seats.]
564,17,3,Captain and his workers,Alright what the hell is going on here?!
565,17,3,Worker 1,"We don't know anything. First there was talk of a hijacking, then reports of an outbreak of some kind."
566,17,3,Worker 2,Confirmed report of panic in a rural town in the Colorado Rockies!
567,17,3,Worker 3,"Sir, the pilot of flight 82 wants an update. They're asking permission to land."
568,17,3,Captain and his workers,Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!
569,17,3,Worker 4,"[walks up with a book] Sir, you'd better look at this. This was found in the airport lavatory. It seems to be a survival guide of some kind."
570,17,3,Captain and his workers,Survival of what?
571,17,3,Worker 4,"From the looks of it, a contagion outbreak of the worst kind. [the book shows a page of black zombies attacking everyone else]"
572,17,3,Captain and his workers,Oh my God.
573,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,"DA43 to tower, please advise! [hangs up the mic] Damnit! They aren't telling me anything!"
574,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,Do you think it's a virus?
575,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,"Virus, bacteria, either way we're all dead! Find out if he thinks it's safe to land in Los Angeles."
576,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,What about Los Angeles? Can we take the plane to Los Angeles?
577,17,3,Eric Cartman,Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. [points to the island on a map.]
578,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,This plane won't make it to Iceland!
579,17,3,Passenger 3,"You got a better idea, asshole?!"
580,17,3,Eric Cartman,Everyone quiet! I have to think!
581,17,3,Tesla Driver,"Yes, let him think!"
582,17,3,Eric Cartman,"I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. [heads off to the restroom. He sees the ""vacant"" sign and opens the door, only to see a black man on the toilet]"
583,17,3,Occupant,"Oh, I'm just finishing up."
584,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Nah! [shuts the door and jumps back, then throws everything he can at the door so the occupant can't exit]"
585,17,3,Occupant,Hey!
586,17,3,Eric Cartman,[running back to his seat] One of them is in the back!
587,17,3,Tesla Driver,What?!
588,17,3,Passenger 3,What do you mean?!
589,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,"Everyone just calm down! We have to stay in control! [the occupant is still trying to get out, and everyone on the plane faces the lavatory door. The occupant begins to grunt and growl]"
590,17,3,Passenger 4,"[at one of the doors] I won't become one of them! [forces it open. It rips away, and he flies out. Other things fly out behind them. The other passengers and crew hang on for dear life. The occupant finally exits the lavatory]"
591,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,"Shoot it! [instead of waiting for Cartman to shoot the occupant, he takes Cartman's gun and shoots him. The occupant ducks and the bullet ricochets a few times. It hits the ceiling, which causes an explosion.]"
592,17,3,Girls Skipping Rope,"Engine engine #9 running down Chicago Line, if the train should jump the track do you want your money back? [the plane appears and only Stan notices it falling to its doom]"
593,17,3,Butters Stotch,Yes.
594,17,3,Girls Skipping Rope,"Y-E-S spells yes- [the plane hits a mountain top, then breaks apart as it goes down the mountain.]"
595,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me."
596,17,3,Token Black,He's just out looking for trouble.
597,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Well that's your side of it, Token, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel. [smoke from the plane crash rises behind the mountains] You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Token, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?"
598,17,3,Tesla Driver,"No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere. [the call drops] Matt? Matt?! [notices Cartman and walks up to him to explain] My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was."
599,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!"
600,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,"[barely alive] Help! Help me! [Cartman runs up to him] Please, I have two little girls in Chicago. Please find them!"
601,17,3,Eric Cartman,It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
602,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,Then you have to stop it.
603,17,3,Tesla Driver,Yes!
604,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from.
605,17,3,Eric Cartman,His name is Token.
606,17,3,Tesla Driver,"We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!"
607,17,3,Eric Cartman,I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
608,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,You have to! You have to be strong. If you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it. [coughs up blood] Promise me! Promise... me!
609,17,3,Eric Cartman,[sighs] Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
610,17,3,Pilot and Copilot,"Thank you-wait, what? [sits up, but dies a few seconds later]"
611,17,3,Tesla Driver,Oh my God! Oh my God!
612,17,3,Eric Cartman,We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
613,17,3,Tesla Driver,Yes!
614,17,3,Eric Cartman,[takes her hand] Come on! [they leave the crash site]
615,17,3,Reporter,"First, a wave of 911 calls about a virus, and now a plane has apparently gone down in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Is this the beginning of the end?"
616,17,3,Butters Stotch,Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
617,17,3,Reporter,"The government is looking for a Patient Zero, going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airport.
[Butters suddenly recognizes the person in the picture] Anyone with information regarding Patient Zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately."
618,17,3,Butters Stotch,Holy Moly.
619,17,3,Jimbo Kern,Can I help you?
620,17,3,Eric Cartman,Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes! [walks up to the counter] I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
621,17,3,Jimbo Kern,"Alright, you want a rifle! [turns around and takes a rifle from the wall, then turns back and hands it to Cartman] well, like this .22 caliber. [Cartman looks it over, and Jimbo puts his hand on his hip] What is it you intend to shoot?"
622,17,3,Eric Cartman,A person. [the driver looks around]
623,17,3,Jimbo Kern,...You mean a person who's threatening you?
624,17,3,Eric Cartman,Threatening all of us!
625,17,3,Tesla Driver,"Please, please hurry! It's important!"
626,17,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you."
627,17,3,Eric Cartman,What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
628,17,3,Jimbo Kern,"You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a ""stand your ground"" law."
629,17,3,Eric Cartman,Stand my ground?
630,17,3,Tesla Driver,Please! We're running out of time!
631,17,3,Jimbo Kern,"See now with a ""stand your ground"" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not."
632,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!"
633,17,3,Jimbo Kern,"No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a ""stand your ground"" law, like Florida."
634,17,3,Eric Cartman,"[walks away from the counter] This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?! [his eyes light up] Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token, [turns around] but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?"
635,17,3,Jimbo Kern,So long as they're threatening you.
636,17,3,Tesla Driver,"What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!"
637,17,3,Eric Cartman,The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
638,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!"
639,17,3,Flight Attendant,This plane is going to Baltimore.
640,17,3,Eric Cartman,"If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left! [everyone sits down] Black guy in the back! [the plane crashes into the Everglades. Cartman and the driver make it out of the wreckage] Alight, now let's find Zimmerman."
641,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. [hands her a black sweater, which she puts on as she walks onto the roadway]"
642,17,3,Tesla Driver,What are we going to do?
643,17,3,Eric Cartman,I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
644,17,3,Tesla Driver,What if he attacks us first?
645,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black."
646,17,3,Tesla Driver,"I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- [a Moov-It truck slams into her and carries her body away. Cartman is confused]"
647,17,3,Mom,"[serving pancakes] Eat your breakfast, girls. [turns around to put the pan back on the stove]"
648,17,3,Older Daughter,Where's Daddy?
649,17,3,Mom,You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry. [the girls giggle and the older one notices someone]
650,17,3,Older Daughter,Daddy!
651,17,3,George Zimmerman,"Good morning, girls. [walks in fully dressed, with a cup of coffee already in hand.] Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. [Mom walks over and kisses him]"
652,17,3,Mom,"How did I get such a perfect husband, Geroge Zimmerman?"
653,17,3,George Zimmerman,And how did I get such a beautiful wife?
654,17,3,Older Daughter,"I love you, Dad."
655,17,3,George Zimmerman,"I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally."
656,17,3,Mom,"Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other."
657,17,3,Reporter,"[on TV] Is there any hope for stopping the zombie apocalypse? [George Zimmerman turns around to see the news] CNN has just received word that the government has learned the identity of Patient Zero. [the drawing of Token is shown] The nine year old threat to humanity has been tracked down, and measures are being taken to stop him."
658,17,3,Younger Daughter,"Daddy, what's a Patient Zero? [a knock is heard at the front door. George Zimmerman turns left and walks to the front door. He opens it and two federal agents face him]"
659,17,3,Agent 1,"Hello, Mr. Zimmerman. Your country needs you."
660,17,3,George Zimmerman,What do you need from me?
661,17,3,Agent 1,We... [holds up a photo of Token] need you to shoot a young African-American for us.
662,17,3,George Zimmerman,[turns and walks away] I gave that up.
663,17,3,Agent 2,"You're the best, Zimmerman. We just need you to do it one more time, for the security of the world!"
664,17,3,George Zimmerman,"Damnit, I have a wife and kids now."
665,17,3,Agent 1,"Then do it for your family! [Cartman appears on the sidewalk, wearing black face paint and a black sweater] This is about protecting people, Zimmerman! Keeping our streets safe so that our children are free to go out... [his voice trails off as Zimmerman focuses on something else]"
666,17,3,George Zimmerman,Something's wrong. [quickly turns around and sees the stranger] Look out! [grabs the gun from one of the agent and fires it twice. Cartman's arm gets hit by a bullet and he falls to the ground]
667,17,3,Agent 1,"My God, I didn't even see him. [the other agent walks over to the body]"
668,17,3,Agent 2,"Nice work, Zimmerman. [George turns and walks over to his family]"
669,17,3,George Zimmerman,Are you guys okay?
670,17,3,Older Daughter,"What was that, Daddy?"
671,17,3,George Zimmerman,More needless violence.
672,17,3,Agent 1,"Nonsense, you did what you had to. You're a hero."
673,17,3,George Zimmerman,"That may be true, but I'll have to live with this the rest of my life. Even though I'll be walking around a free man."
674,17,3,Agent 2,"[notices the paint coming off Cartman's face] Hey, wait a minute. This kid isn't black, he's white."
675,17,3,George Zimmerman,"Wait, what?"
676,17,3,Judge,Guilty!
677,17,3,Reporter,"The zombie apocalypse... is over. All the panic, crashing planes and chaos appear to have, for some reason, died with George Zimmerman. And as for the little boy who was so mercilessly gunned down? [a picture of Cartman smiling appears, his left shoulder in a bandage, his right hand giving a thumbs up] Although he survived the shooting, his wishes are to remain anonymous, giving the hospital only the nickname... ""Brad Pitt."" ...But cooler."
678,17,3,Stan Marsh,That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
679,17,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that sucked."
680,17,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? [Token just stands up, looks at the other guys, and walks out. Butters' smile fades]"
681,17,3,Eric Cartman,Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
682,17,3,Token Black,You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
683,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry."
684,17,3,Token Black,So what?!
685,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh. [brings forth a can of red spray paint and paints a red circle around himself in the middle of the street] Sounds like you're still angry, Token."
686,17,3,Token Black,Fuck you!
687,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea. [makes a fist with his right hand and puts it forth] First bump? [Token stays put] Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. [Token walks up to the red circle, then bends forward and offers his left fist. Then he steps into the circle and Cartman quickly shoots him]"
688,17,3,Token Black,Oh! [falls on his face]
689,17,3,Eric Cartman,"That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine. [drags Token's body into the circle] Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. [smiles when no one answers.]"
690,17,3,Gerry s Daughters,Daddy!
691,17,3,Gerry,What's up girls? Daddy did it!
692,17,3,Eric Cartman,Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
693,17,3,Kyle Broflovski,You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
694,17,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah. So bad.
695,17,3,Kyle Broflovski,That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
696,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Jury found me innocent, Kyle!"
697,17,3,Kyle Broflovski,You're a murderer.
698,17,3,Eric Cartman,You interrupt people when they talk.
699,17,3,Mr Mackey,[over the PA system] Eric Cartman to the counselor's office please.
700,17,3,Eric Cartman,Oh man! [walks out of the room]
701,17,3,Eric Cartman,Oh boy.
702,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Have a seat, Eric. Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you're having, okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or you're gettin' detention!"
703,17,3,Token Black,An apology?! He shot me!
704,17,3,Mr Mackey,"Well he was technically standing his ground, Token."
705,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava."
706,17,3,Token Black,[stands on his chair] Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!
707,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Token, calm down."
708,17,3,Token Black,And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
709,17,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, here we go again! [runs out of the office in a panic]"
710,17,4,Henrietta,"So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more."
711,17,4,Pete,"Whoa... That's pretty hardcore. [taps some ashes off his cigarette into his ashtray, then flips his hair]"
712,17,4,Michael,That's real pain right there. [taps some ashes off his cigarette into his ashtray]
713,17,4,Henrietta,"That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. [Mrs. Biggle knocks three times on Henrietta's door, then opens it]"
714,17,4,Mrs Biggle,"[sing song] Henrietta, sweetie."
715,17,4,Henrietta,"[glares at her] Shut up, Mom! Go away!"
716,17,4,Mrs Biggle,"Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess."
717,17,4,Henrietta,Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
718,17,4,Mrs Biggle,We'll be waiting in the living room.
719,17,4,Henrietta,"[rolls her eyes] God, she just never stops!"
720,17,4,Mrs Biggle,Oh goodness I am so nervous. [Henrietta enters the living room]
721,17,4,Henrietta,What?!
722,17,4,Mr Biggle,"Have a seat, Henrietta. [Henrietta sits on the chair]"
723,17,4,Mrs Biggle,"Oh, a little family chit-chaaat."
724,17,4,Henrietta,"Shut up, Mom!"
725,17,4,Mr Biggle,"Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time."
726,17,4,Henrietta,Are we really doing this again?!
727,17,4,Mr Biggle,"We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo."
728,17,4,Henrietta,What?!
729,17,4,Mrs Biggle,"But Daddy and I love our little muffin, even if she's emo or not."
730,17,4,Henrietta,I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
731,17,4,Mr Biggle,Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?
732,17,4,Mrs Biggle,Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz.
733,17,4,Mr Biggle,"So listen, sweetie, we've found a camp. [her mom brings out a brochure]"
734,17,4,Henrietta,Noo...
735,17,4,Mr Biggle,"A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility."
736,17,4,Henrietta,"[stands up, ready to leave the room] I'm not going to any fucking camp!"
737,17,4,Mr Biggle,"It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges."
738,17,4,Henrietta,I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
739,17,4,Mrs Biggle,Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.
740,17,4,Pete,And that's all you know? what else did she say?
741,17,4,Michael,She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.
742,17,4,Pete,"[flips hair] Oh my God, for two weeks?"
743,17,4,Firkle,Is she at the camp now?
744,17,4,Michael,"I don't know. [scrolls through his text messages] She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark."
745,17,4,Pete,[softly] Whoa...
746,17,4,Firkle,That's fucking creepy man.
747,17,4,Michael,[gets up and walks a bit] I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.
748,17,4,CPS Worker,"Alright now, you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents."
749,17,4,Michael,Yes. They called her an emo.
750,17,4,CPS Worker,What's wrong with that?
751,17,4,Michael,"Emos suck! Their vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes!"
752,17,4,CPS Worker,"So, why do you think they called her that?"
753,17,4,Michael,"Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!"
754,17,4,CPS Worker,What is the difference?
755,17,4,Pete,Oh my God! They're totally different!
756,17,4,CPS Worker,"Okay, different how?"
757,17,4,Pete,"They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible! [flips hair] You're, you know... They're posers!"
758,17,4,Firkle,Emos suck my Goth balls.
759,17,4,Michael,"Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an emo thinks that deep down, they are totally fucked up."
760,17,4,CPS Worker,That's not much of a difference.
761,17,4,Pete,That's a huge fucking difference!
762,17,4,Michael,"Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide."
763,17,4,Pete,"This fuckin' bitch, man."
764,17,4,Michael,But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people commit suicide
765,17,4,Pete,Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
766,17,4,Michael,"Wait, I thought we were cynical. ...What what whatever, it doesn't matter."
767,17,4,Pete,"No, see, you're nihilistic."
768,17,4,Michael,"Oh yeah, you're right."
769,17,4,Henrietta,"Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this! [notices the camera and looks at it.] This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! [the floor opens up behind her. She turns around to see what's going on, and a plant rises into the room. She looks at the plant, puzzled. It begins to shake like a rattle, then stops]"
770,17,4,Pete,"What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?"
771,17,4,Michael,She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have? [the bus arrives and they all turn to look at it stop. The rear doors open and they look in. Henrietta appears and they gasp.]
772,17,4,Firkle,"Oh. My. God. [Henrietta steps off, and boy has she changed!]"
773,17,4,Henrietta,"Hey guys. [she now wears a green headband, pink highlights in her hair, and additional pink makeup around her eyes. The left eye is made to look as though it's been crying. Her gloves are pink and black and instead of her cross necklace, she wears a necklace where the pendant is shaped like a bat]"
774,17,4,Pete,What the hell have they done to you?
775,17,4,Henrietta,What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. [walks away. The other three move a bit to get a better look at her leaving]
776,17,4,Michael,Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her emo!
777,17,4,Michael,[concerned] Has she said one word to either one of you guys?
778,17,4,Pete,Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. [flip]
779,17,4,Michael,"She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids. [the camera pans right, across the aisle, and shows Henrietta with her new friends, the Emos]"
780,17,4,Emo Boy,"God, PE class is for such wannabe posers."
781,17,4,Emo Girl,I'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts.
782,17,4,Henrietta,"I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die."
783,17,4,Pete,"Uugh, how could she hang out with them??"
784,17,4,Michael,There must something else going on here.
785,17,4,Henrietta,Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!
786,17,4,Michael,"[enters] It's not your mom, it's me."
787,17,4,Henrietta,"Oh, hey. [lowers the volume.]"
788,17,4,Michael,What did they do you you? At that camp?
789,17,4,Henrietta,What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
790,17,4,Michael,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo."
791,17,4,Henrietta,"That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?"
792,17,4,Michael,"Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate? [she sits up and then turns off the iPod] I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they knew what they were doing."
793,17,4,Henrietta,"[getting cross, then turns her chair around slowly] You should probably stop digging for answers."
794,17,4,Michael,What?!
795,17,4,Henrietta,There's no winning this for you. [gets off her chair and walks towards him] Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
796,17,4,Michael,Nooo waaaaay.
797,17,4,Henrietta,Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
798,17,4,Michael,Omigodnowaaaaaaaaay.
799,17,4,Henrietta,"Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth? [sataniccally] Join us!"
800,17,4,Michael,[runs out of the house] No waaay! [runs out of the house and across the street and throws his cane away to the ground] No way no waaaaaay!
801,17,4,A ring tone,Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and desp-
802,17,4,Pete,[answers it] Hello?
803,17,4,Michael,It's worse thann we thought.
804,17,4,Pete,What is? Everything? [flips hair]
805,17,4,Michael,"No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like ""I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world"" and I was like ""No waaay!"" and she was like ""Yeah, soon it will be too late."" and I was all ""No waaay!"""
806,17,4,Pete,No way.
807,17,4,Michael,"Yeah, so listen: call up Firkle and meet me at Village Inn. I gotta run home, but I'll be there in ten minutes. [rushes home and closes the front door, then runs up the stairs.]"
808,17,4,Michael's Mom and Dad,Michael! Michael! [Michael leans over the rail]
809,17,4,Michael,"Can't now, Mom! I've got an emergency!"
810,17,4,Michael's Mom and Dad,"In the dining room Michael! Let's go! [Michael goes down reluctantly and enters the dining room] Have a seat, son. [Michael takes a seat opposite his dad.] Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while."
811,17,4,Michael,What??
812,17,4,Michael's Mom and Dad,[holds up the same brochure Mrs. Biggle held up two weeks earlier] We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-
813,17,4,Michael,What the hell are you talking about?!
814,17,4,Michael's Mom and Dad,"This place gonna fix you, make you normal child! [moments later his dad takes him outside and toward the truck]"
815,17,4,Michael,"No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!! [Dad throws him into the car] You fucking conformists! [the truck starts up and backs out of the driveway. Michael looks across the street and sees Henrietta with her emo friends, two of whom are new. He gasps. As the truck pulls away he screams through the closed window] They're evillll!"
816,17,4,Pete,I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
817,17,4,Firkle,Pete... if they get me... if I get sent to that camp... and I come back Emo... kill me. Promise that you'll kill me.
818,17,4,Pete,[flips hair] I promise.
819,17,4,Village Inn Waitress,"Hey, you kids need to order somethin' or you need to go! [pours some coffee into Firkle's mug.]"
820,17,4,Pete,"Not now, lady, we're really depressed."
821,17,4,Village Inn Waitress,So what else is new?
822,17,4,Pete,"This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos! [flips hair] There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires."
823,17,4,Firkle,Are you crazy?
824,17,4,Pete,[leaves the booth] What choice do we have?!
825,17,4,Firkle,"The Vampires are our sworn enemy. We beat up their leader, and burned down their lair. Don't you remember?"
826,17,4,Pete,"Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help."
827,17,4,Vampir,"Okay, let's all be seated please? [the kids quiet down] This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se."
828,17,4,Vamps,Hail Mike.
829,17,4,Mike,"Okay uhhh, our main order of business is of course the Halloween social. We're still looking for volunteers to make the- [a round of snarls goes up as Pete and Firkle enter the meeting]"
830,17,4,Mohawk Vamp,It's the Goth kids! [moves aside. The other Vamps turn to look at the Goths and take to hissing and snarling at them. A boy vamp steps forward and spits at Pete as Pete and Firkle head for the podium]
831,17,4,Pete,"Ugh. You spit on me, Larry. [Mike steps down so Pete can address the Vamps] Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall."
832,17,4,Firkle,Sorry.
833,17,4,Pete,"But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem."
834,17,4,Mike,You've got a lot of nerve coming here!
835,17,4,Pete,"Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo. [the Vamps start talking amongst themselves] Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned."
836,17,4,Black Vamp,Okay hold up! Hold up! You mean that one of us might not really be a Vamp kid? [no one says a thing]
837,17,4,Pete,"Uhhhhh, right."
838,17,4,Black Vamp,"[steps into the aisle and moves forward] Well whoever you is, you better get yo' ass ready to run, muthafucka, 'cause you're a damn traitor! And I bet you it's this little nigga right here![stops by a Vamp in a skeleton sweater and purple highlights in his hair]"
839,17,4,Henrietta,Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
840,17,4,Emo Girl,I can't. I'm too depressed. I keep cutting myself.
841,17,4,Henrietta,Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. [a knock is heard at her door]
842,17,4,Mrs Biggle,"[sing-song] Henrietta, I baked cookies for your new little Emo friends."
843,17,4,Henrietta,"Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?! [gets sarcastic] I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! [her mom takes the cookies back and closes the door. She goes to the living room]"
844,17,4,Mr Biggle,Does she still seem better?
845,17,4,Mrs Biggle,"Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me."
846,17,4,Mr Biggle,Well that's more like it.
847,17,4,Emo Boy 1,"You know what we should do? After us Emos take over the Earth? We should um, paint the White House black. And we should have Fall Out Boy at the Super Bowl. [Mike rises up from under the window sill. The Emos don't notice]"
848,17,4,Emo Boy 2,We're Emos. [the cowlick Vamp rises up next to Mike] When we rule the Earth we're not gonna have football.
849,17,4,Emo Boy 1,"Oh yeah. [outside, three other Vamps hold up the two boys peering inside the window. Pete and Firkle sit on the roof nearby. The Vamps have seen enough and withdraw from the window]"
850,17,4,Mike,And you say she just showed up like this?
851,17,4,Pete,You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
852,17,4,Cowlick Vamp,That blonde Emo is Sarah Collins. She was a Vamp kid two weeks ago.
853,17,4,Black Vamp,You want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas?! I'll do it!
854,17,4,Pete,We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
855,17,4,Mike,"Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it."
856,17,4,Cowlick Vamp,Do you mean?
857,17,4,Mike,"Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning."
858,17,4,Mike,"We call upon the creator of all that is dark! The godfather of Death and Despair! Edgar Allan Poe, your followers in darkness beg for your help! [everyone looks around, but nothing happens] We summon to the world of the living the great Edgar Allan Poe! Knower of all that is misery! Your children need special guidance! Per se."
859,17,4,Pete,"This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!"
860,17,4,Mike,Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid.
861,17,4,Pete,"No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!"
862,17,4,Black Vamp,"Ey, look man! All genres of Gothic subcultures are derivatives of Poe's work. Muthafucka!"
863,17,4,Pete,"Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! [a violent thunderclap and lightning immediately follow, and a vortex opens up on the ceiling]"
864,17,4,Cowlick Vamp,Holy shit look! [Edgar Allan Poe appears and the vortex vanishes]
865,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,Where am I? What is this place?
866,17,4,Firkle,It's him! It's Edgar Allan Poe.
867,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,Why have the living summoned me from my rest? [Mike taps Pete to signal that it's his turn to speak]
868,17,4,Pete,"Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos."
869,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists."
870,17,4,Mike,"Yeah, oh yes!"
871,17,4,Pete,Right!
872,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs."
873,17,4,Pete,Thank you!
874,17,4,Mike,Hey!
875,17,4,Pete,I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
876,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?"
877,17,4,Black Vamp,"Ah ah! He got you there, nigga!"
878,17,4,Pete,"Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos."
879,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!
880,17,4,Pete,"Uh, yeah, it kind of does."
881,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"[floats away, mocking] Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom."
882,17,4,Michael,"What? Where are you tay- No! NO!! [jerks around and wakes up, assessing his situation] What the hell?? ...Oh my God. [he realizes where he is and tries to shake himself loose from the ropes] Get me out of here! Let me go!"
883,17,4,Gardener,Shhhhh. [Michael sees him] It's best you don't upset them. [goes to water another plant]
884,17,4,Michael,What the hell are you doing to people?!
885,17,4,Gardener,"Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat."
886,17,4,Michael,Wait a minute. Emos are plants? [the plants begin to rattle in their pots.]
887,17,4,Gardener,"Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody undertands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species.[] Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain."
888,17,4,Michael,"Oh, it all makes sense now! [A giant emoclarus rattles into view]"
889,17,4,Gardener,"Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King. [holds a conversation with it] Oh no, I wasn't talking to him. I mean, I was, but- Y-yes! Yes, I understand. [walks back to a smaller plant] Right away.[takes the potted plant and walks over to Michael]"
890,17,4,Michael,No. [the gardener sets the plant down next to him] What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!
891,17,4,Gardener,"[walks away, then turns around] You just don't understand. You'll understand them soon."
892,17,4,Michael,What the...? [the plant begins to rattle]
893,17,4,Gardener,It's quicker if you don't fight it.
894,17,4,Michael,"No, NOOOOOOOOO! [begins to rattle with the plant]"
895,17,4,Pete,"Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out."
896,17,4,Firkle,"[coughs] Dude, Edgar, can you not smoke in the car?"
897,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!
898,17,4,Pete,"Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!"
899,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"God, you guys are so lame! [tosses his cigarette out the window] And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar."
900,17,4,Black Vamp,"Well that's your name, isn't it?"
901,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain
902,17,4,Black Vamp,Oh God...
903,17,4,Mike,Oh God...
904,17,4,and Pete,Oh God...
905,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,What? You guys are posers!
906,17,4,Black Vamp,"Ey, just so you all know, if one of you ain't who you say they is, and we get inside that base and you reveal you're actually one of them Emo muthafuckas in disguise, I WILL go crazy on yo' ass!"
907,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader."
908,17,4,Mike,"Oh, fuck off, NightPain."
909,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"Make me, poser."
910,17,4,Pete,Michael?! You here?
911,17,4,Mike,"I feel like we're being watched. [yes they are, by the Security Cam 3000. A fourth camera shows Henrietta's former room. Zoomiing out reveals an emoclarus looking over a desk with videocameras all around. The king emoclarus looks on. It leans over and seems to whipser to the security emoclarus. In the greenhouse, the group reaches Michael, who has become delirious and is now groaning]"
912,17,4,Pete,"Dude! Michael, are you okay?"
913,17,4,Michael,"Kick it over! Stop the plant! [Mike walks over and kicks the plant away, then gets into a karate stance. Firkle disappears] Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies."
914,17,4,Pete,"Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. [a gun is cocked and everyone looks at the source]"
915,17,4,Firkle,"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's not the plan."
916,17,4,Gardener,[appears behind him and approaches the group] You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication.
917,17,4,Michael,Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo? [Firkle takes off his jacket and ... wig.]
918,17,4,Firkle,Don't you see we can't stop them? We might as well join' em. [The Emo King shows up and starts rattling. The gardener turns around and walks toward it]
919,17,4,Gardener,"Yes Emo King, right away. [turns around again] The Emo King wants us to proceed at once. [moments later the black Vamp, Mike, and Pete are tied to chairs and plants are placed in front of them]"
920,17,4,Pete,"Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!"
921,17,4,Gardener,Don't fight it. It's quicker that way. [the plants begin to rattle]
922,17,4,Mike,Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo.
923,17,4,Pete,Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
924,17,4,Mike,"He said he was over this, and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn."
925,17,4,Pete,What?!
926,17,4,Village Inn Waitress,"[approaches] Hey, are you gonna order any food, or are you just gonna sit there and drink coffee all day?"
927,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,Leave me alone! I just want coffeh.
928,17,4,Village Inn Waitress,[turns around and leaves] Little prick.
929,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,Bitch.
930,17,4,Pete,"[voice only] Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you? [his face appears in Poe's coffee] What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!"
931,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.
932,17,4,Pete,"Look, we [flips hair] summoned you to help us save the world!"
933,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?
934,17,4,Pete,"God, he is such a downer! [the plants rattle again]"
935,17,4,Gardener,Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it.
936,17,4,Mike,Wait. Look!
937,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"[floating in] Okay, I'm here, posers."
938,17,4,Pete,NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! [Poe descends and lands next to the Emo King]
939,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,What do you want me to do?
940,17,4,Mike,Shoot it!
941,17,4,Michael,Shoot it!
942,17,4,and Pete,Shoot it!
943,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,Really? Shoot a plant?
944,17,4,Michael,"Shoot it! [Poe obliges, but nothing happens to the plant. A piece of its pot might have come off. Poe just shrugs.]"
945,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,Wait a minute. What is this? [walks over and pulls out the plant's tag] This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95. [it's a common ficus]
946,17,4,Gardener,Lowe's Home and Garden?
947,17,4,Pete,"Hey, these are just plants."
948,17,4,Gardener,"No they, they talk to me."
949,17,4,Edgar Allan Poe,"No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots."
950,17,4,Gardener,But-
951,17,4,Voice,"Looks like it's over, Harold Flannagan. So we have just one question for you: are you scared?!"
952,17,4,Sarah and Harold/Howard Flannagan,[frozen in fear] What do you mean?
953,17,4,Voice,ARE YOU SCARED?!
954,17,4,Sarah and Harold/Howard Flannagan,YES!!! [Pete flips his hair]
955,17,4,Voice,"That's good! 'Cause you're on... ""Yes, I Was Scared!"" [music plays and the lights come on]"
956,17,4,Pete,What?? [the cast and crew of that show come out of the plant work.]
957,17,4,"""Yes, I Am Scared!"" Host",Look! Look at the camera right there
958,17,4,Sarah and Harold/Howard Flannagan,"Oh my God, are you serious? [grins.]"
959,17,4,"""Yes, I Am Scared!"" Host",Your wife Sarah put you up to this.
960,17,4,Sarah and Harold/Howard Flannagan,[pops in next to Harold] Haha I got you! [giggles some more]
961,17,4,Firkle,This is a prank?
962,17,4,Black Vamp,Oh man that's good! They got us good!
963,17,4,Firkle,I turned traitor for no reason?
964,17,4,Pete,[to Michael] Did you know about this?
965,17,4,Michael,I have no idea what's going on.
966,17,4,"""Yes, I Am Scared!"" Host","Howard, did you suspect at all that a gardener job at a camp for troubled teens was a setup?"
967,17,4,Sarah and Harold/Howard Flannagan,"No, they really had me convinced!"
968,17,4,"""Yes, I Am Scared!"" Host",And you didn't suspect anything when we had plants tell you to turn Goths and Vamp kids into Emos when really they're exactly the same thing?
969,17,4,Sarah and Harold/Howard Flannagan,I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot. [laughs about it]
970,17,4,"""Yes, I Am Scared!"" Host","Tune in again next week, when we make a woman from Milwaukee think she's working at a haunted abortion clinic."
971,17,4,Henrietta,"So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?"
972,17,4,Pete,"Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants. [she stops drawing] From Lowe's Home and Garden."
973,17,4,Michael,It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.
974,17,4,Henrietta,"Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily."

976,17,4,Henrietta,"Oh my Gawd. [closes her eyes, drops her pen on the table, and pinches her nose at the bridge] This is so... em-barrassing."
977,17,4,Pete,"Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was [flips his hair] we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader."
978,17,4,Henrietta,"Oh. [sudden relief] Oh! [she begiins convulsing, then turns around in her chair] Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again! [gets off her chair and walks to the boys] Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys."
979,17,4,Mrs Biggle,"[peeks into the room] Henrietta, I have dinner ready."
980,17,4,Henrietta,"Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!"
981,17,4,Mrs Biggle,...Fatty. [closes the door.]
982,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future. [holds a laptop with an IntelliLink logo on it] M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink. [presses a key that brings up the splash screen] Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal. [presses the space bar] M'kay... [presses it again. Presses is twice more, and the main menu pops up] You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school. [one such panel is shown next to the window] Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on ""school clinic""[presses a button, and the school clinic menu pops up.] Mkay, see nurse. [selects it and a box appears on the right side with fields for teachers, student, note, and some checkboxes.]M'kay. Respiration problems. [presses a button, and ""All Night Long"" plays] Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay. [presses a key, and the song is cut off] It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board. [press, and gets to the main menu] Mesage... board. [moves the cursor to the message board icon and loads the board] Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance, [sees the first thread title that loads] here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski. [loads the message] Okay, little Ike says ""My brother is a homo""[Cartman cackles and Kyle is startled] Ike made a little drawing of his brother too. [loads the drawing] Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice. [Cartman cackles again, and Kyle looks annoyed] It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there."
983,17,5,Eric Cartman,"That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls."
984,17,5,Butters Stotch,"Heheh, yeah. [chuckles to himself. Kyle is now annoyed and embarrassed]"
985,17,5,,"[The Broflovski house, day, kitchen. Sheila is washing dishes when Kyle appears and enters]"
986,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me."
987,17,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore."
988,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head."
989,17,5,Sheila Broflovski,"It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. [Kyle thinks it over and walks out]"

993,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
994,17,5,Ike Broflovski,Do I look like I wanna do fuckin' fingerpaints?! [looks over his shoulder again] Look at the fuckin' zits on my face!
995,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, I just want us to be friends again."
996,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!"
997,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times."

999,17,5,Ike Broflovski,Dancy Dance is my favorite.
1000,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,It always has been. See? This is nice. [Foofa steps forward]
1001,17,5,Ike Broflovski,Who would you rather fuck? [Kyle is stunned] Foofa or Toodee?
1002,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1003,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"I wanna fuck Foofa. [a closeup of Foofa dancing] I wouldn't wanna fuck Toodee. She's a dike. You can tell. But Foofa, man. [whips out a can of chewing tobacco, opens it, and scoops some tobacco out] I bet she's got some sweet strange. [puts the tobacco in his mouth] I don't even know what the fuck Muno is."
1004,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, is that chewing tobacco?"
1005,17,5,Ike Broflovski,What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!
1006,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I just don't think it's healthy."
1007,17,5,Ike Broflovski,That's 'cause you don't understand shit! [stands on the sofa] I knew this was a bad idea! [leaves the sofa and walks away] I'm gonna watch Yo Gabba Gabba in my roomsy!

1009,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[opens the door and peeks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?"
1010,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?"
1011,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,[goes all the way in] No.
1012,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Ookay, that's fine, that's fine. We can use IntelliLink to see what's available. Let's see, counseling request. Students. Make appointment. [presses a key and his window blind goes down, and Kyle notices] Okay, ah whoops. Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment. [presses a key and the lights go out. He looks around] Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?"
1013,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
1014,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?"
1015,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,Right now.
1016,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?"
1017,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
1018,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Alright, I can do a lookup for the name. Uh go back. Main menu. [""The Heat Is On"" begins to play, and Mr. Mackey has lost control] Oh... Damnit. Okay now, back. [mumbles to himself as he tries to set things right] Set- no, set appointment. Okay, speakers off. [his blind rises] Okay, uh... Okay, what is your smart name, Kyle?"
1019,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1020,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere."
1021,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Okay, let's see, lights. [presses the light icon and some other icons pop up] Mood. [presses the mood icon and a timer pops up] Start counseling timer. [sets it for 15 minutes and starts it] Okay there we go. Okay, we got it. [smiles] Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?"
1022,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[takes a moment to gather them] He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex."
1023,17,5,Mr Mackey,Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.
1024,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, he just seems so young."
1025,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don't you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M'kay? [plop] You know, this is the first time I've been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing."
1026,17,5,,"[A live program. The Canadian Board of Health Presents, ""What Are These Changes?"" A Guide To Puberty In Canada]"
1027,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you've probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard. [a long pause] Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you're a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you're a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange."
1028,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!"
1029,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's just give it a chance, Ike."
1030,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You're saying things like ""hey boddy"" and ""hey guy"" because now that you're older you're discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call ""guy"" is quickly becoming your friend. [A shot of Kyle and Ike looking at each other] But now let's discuss how a man and a woman make love. [an animated stick-figure cartoon follows] First, a man and a woman fall in love. Then the man farts on the woman's strange, [That is shown, with audio] filling the woman's strange with air so that the woman can queef on the man's face. [shown, with audio] And, a baby is born. [pop] The entire process can take up to six months a- [turns to his right to listen...] It's what? ... That's not how a baby is born? ... What's semen? ... Well then, why did my wife queef on my face? ... She said it was to- ... [gets mad] Well then why would sh-?! ... I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! [pounds on the desk and leaves]"
1031,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Make me look like an idiot, will you?!"
1032,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born!
1033,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,I was being sarcastic.
1034,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done!
1035,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,I was angry because you never listen to me. Because I wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go.
1036,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!
1037,17,5,,[The host goes to a therapy session with his wife.]
1038,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face!
1039,17,5,Therapist Rick,"Well, maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home."
1040,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,What the fuck is going on?!
1041,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"[hops off the sofa...] You're fucking stupid, Kyle! [...and walks away]"
1042,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!"
1043,17,5,Stan Marsh,He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
1044,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,He doesn't even let me near him!
1045,17,5,Eric Cartman,"That sucks, dude."
1046,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,What??
1047,17,5,Eric Cartman,"I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE."
1048,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, thanks! [Mr. Mackey is at the IntelliLink panel trying to set things right. The music stops and he stands up]"
1049,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?"
1050,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
1051,17,5,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, can he just go talk to the principal?"
1052,17,5,Mr Mackey,"No, this is gonna work! I called IntelliLink and they said they were sending over an engineer. [someone knocks on the door.]"
1053,17,5,Cody,[looks in] Is this Classroom 7?
1054,17,5,Mr Mackey,Yes!
1055,17,5,Cody,My name's Cody. I'm your smartnician. You're havin' some intelliproblems with your astutelinks?
1056,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?"
1057,17,5,Cody,"[taps the screen a few times] Uh huh, well here's the problem: your amsrtnames aren't intelligrated. [shows him the error screen]"
1058,17,5,Mr Mackey,Oh I see.
1059,17,5,Cody,"If you wanna have those intelligrated with EasyLink, you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package."
1060,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?"

1092,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
1093,17,5,Muno,"A little young for that, isn't he?"
1094,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,That's what I thought.

1105,17,5,Therapist Rick,Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?
1106,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again?"
1107,17,5,Therapist Rick,Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?
1108,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,What do you mean?
1109,17,5,Therapist Rick,"There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection."
1110,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,I took the job to try and make Canada's health care system better. What could that have to do with my wife?

1116,17,5,Mr Adler,They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
1117,17,5,Mr Mackey,I know that IntelliLink has had some... hiccups... uhkay. But I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the IntelliLink system and make sure it runs smoothly. I want you all to meet Pat Conners. [she enters and takes a seat next to Mr. Mackey]
1118,17,5,Pat Conners,Hello everyone.
1119,17,5,Mr Mackey,"[immediately points a finger at her] Don't ""Hello"" us, Pat! This system that you're responsible for now isn't working out! So [pounds his fist on the table] what the hell are you gonna do about it?!"

1121,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Getting acclimated?! [stands up in anger] Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out! [Pat takes her briefcase and walks out] Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay.

1122,17,5,Principal Victoria,Oh noo!
1123,17,5,Mr Mackey,"No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes."
1124,17,5,Coach Miles,"Mr. Mackey, let's be clear. IntelliLink was your idea. You should admit it was a bad one and stop being so defensive."
1125,17,5,Mr Mackey,"Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an ""accident"" while you were ""drinking"" on a ""hike,"" ""N'kay!"""
1126,17,5,Coach Miles,Hey now listen here-!
1127,17,5,Mr Mackey,"No! Now you listen to me! [pounds his fist on the table] IntelliLink is a great idea, and we just need the Goddamned Gold Package! We are doublin' down!"

1155,17,5,Plex,"Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see."
1156,17,5,Troupe,Don't show your strange on TV
1157,17,5,Sin ad,I'm looking for a boyfriend. Looking for a boyfriend.
1158,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Will you get out of my living room, please?! [the phone rings and he answers it] Hello?!"
1159,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,[calling in from Canada] ...Have you ever had someone you love queef in your face? [serves himself some Canadian port]
1160,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1161,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"I'm sorry, I'm calling everyone in the Canadian health care system to find out if they're pleased with their health care. Is this [checks his monitor] Ike Broflovski?"
1162,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No, this is his brother."
1163,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service."
1164,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,Satisfied with- [thinks a bit] Wait a minute. What medication?!
1165,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores."
1166,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[confused] Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!"
1167,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,People all over the world get their medication from Canada.
1168,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!"
1169,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,That's impossible! The Canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with IntelliLink. [this alarms Kyle]
1170,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
1171,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Sure, no problem. [gets to work] Now, what is your brother's Canadian Medicare's smartname?"
1172,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I dunno! [thinks a bit] Try ""strangetamer."""
1173,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"""strangetamer"" [the lights go out, a window shade comes down] Uh, yeP, there it is. [presses a key and the lights come on] Ahh yes, here we go. I see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last May. [check again] Ah, yes, I'm afraid IntelliLink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast."
1174,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
1175,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Yes, that's right."
1176,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
1177,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"It's fine! [pounds the table with his fists] It works fine! Just give it some time! [stands up] God, you sound like my wife! [turns left and walks away from the chair.] My... my wife."
1178,17,5,Therapist Rick,"[sitting in an armchair nearby] That must be it. Don't you see, Terry? That health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile, and your wife's been puttin' up with it."
1179,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"[thinking out loud, in a stammer] And... that's why she queefed in my face."
1180,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!"
1181,17,5,Announcer,Tom Brady looking sluggish again today. Not sure what his problem has been lately.
1182,17,5,Tom Brady,Blue 28! ... Blue 28!
1183,17,5,"Anchor, Announcer, and Commentator","Yeah, definitely not looking as strong and virile as he has in the past, Tom."
1184,17,5,Tom Brady,"[his pants begin filling with poop] Huthuuuut [more poop comes out. The more he says it, the more his pants fill with poop] Hike!"
1185,17,5,Announcer,"Brady steps back to pass. [Brady makes sure not to trip over his poop] He's got an open man at the 40 yard line! [Tom throws the ball, but it goes straight to the ground]"
1186,17,5,"Anchor, Announcer, and Commentator","And whatever is wrong with Tom Brady just seems to be getting worse. [Exhausted, Brady just sits on top of his poop and then sinks into it] Go Broncos."
1187,17,5,,"[South Park Elementary cafeteria, day. The sprinklers haved turned on and drenched everything. ""The Heat Is On"" plays on the PA system. Mr. Mackey sits on the floor in the same position Brady was in. The emergency lights flash on and off, and the kids are still eating lunch, despite being drenched. Suddenly, the music, lights, and sprinklers stop]"
1188,17,5,Cody,"Okay, there we go. [Mr. Mackey lifts his head up, disgusted] Your students can buy school lunches now, but they won't be able to get grades."
1189,17,5,Mr Mackey,"No, they have to be able to get grades!"
1190,17,5,Cody,"Well, what you prbably wanna do is upgrade to IntelliLink Platinum."
1191,17,5,Mr Mackey,"No! There's no more upgrades, m;kay?! I just want this [points to a panel] to work!"
1192,17,5,Cody,"...What exactly do you mean by ""work""?"
1193,17,5,Mr Mackey,"I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!"
1194,17,5,Cody,"Oh, you want the Centurion package. That's where we take all the IntelliLink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them. Then we wipe all the computers of IntelliLink software and you never deal with us again."
1195,17,5,Mr Mackey,"[walks away and thinks it over] Alright, upgrade me to the Centurion package."
1196,17,5,Cody,"Right away. [goes to Room 7 to rip off the panel from the wall as Mr. Garrison watches from his desk, goes to the bathroom and rips the panels off the walls, goes to the various school offices and tears the panels off there, makes a bonfire in a steel drum out on the playground, and dumps all the IntelliLink hardware into it. He returns to the cafeteria and joins Mr. Mackey again, offering him a clipboard] Well alright sir, here's a clipboard you can use for students to sign up for counseling, [Mr. Garrison takes the clipboard] and I wanna thank you for choosing IntelliLink. [reaches into his back pocket, takes out a gun, and blows his brains out. He falls down, dead. All the students as well as Mackey are stunned]"
1197,17,5,,"[The MTV VMAs, night]"
1198,17,5,Announcer,"The MTV Video Music Awards will be back with a performance from Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa singing, ""Pound My Sweet Strange."""
1199,17,5,,"[backstage, Foofa and Ike wait for her cue]"
1200,17,5,Stage hand,"Two minutes, Foofa."
1201,17,5,Foofa,"Thanks. Oh my, here we go! [Kyle appears at the far end of the room]"
1202,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ike! [runs up to him] Wait! [the rest of Yo Gabba Gabba show up]
1203,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"Get out of here, dude!"
1204,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand."
1205,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"No, you don't understand, wuss! Why can't you just let me grow up?! Why do you keep harassing me?!"
1206,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit! [Ike is awed at this] And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!"
1207,17,5,VMA Host,"All right, y'all, here comes our next big act!"
1208,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it."
1209,17,5,VMA Host,"Give it up for the sexiest bitch on earth, it's Foofa!"
1210,17,5,Foofa,"Come on, Ike. Ike?"
1211,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"He's right, Foofa. Part of growing up is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older whether I like it or not. So why push it? I think I'm just gonna let it happen naturally. [walks to Kyle and the troupe]"
1212,17,5,"Yo Gabba Gabba: Brobee, Foofa, Muno, Plex, and Toodee",Yaaaaay.
1213,17,5,Brobee,"Foofa? [Foofa looks at the curtains, then at the group, then takes off her towel to reveal her domiatrix outfit, with two arrows pointing towards her strange, and walks out onto the stage]"
1214,17,5,Foofa,"Come on, come on, and pound my strange. Pound it like this, [Yo Gabba Gabba reacts. Brobee covers his eyes] pound it like that."
1215,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,It was a mistake.
1216,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,What?
1217,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Trying to reform Canada's health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasn't working. And even when my wife said the system was too complicated, I wouldn't listen."
1218,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Oh Terry, I was just trying to get your attention. I'm sorry I queefed in your face."
1219,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"I deserved it. Anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face. Thank you, my lady."
1220,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"So IntelliLink is gone, my lord?"
1221,17,5,Minister Terry and Wife,"Yes, I've upgraded to the Gold package. Within no time, Canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications, and going back to normal."
1222,17,5,,"[The Broflovski house, just before dawn. Kyle is asleep, but is awakened by chortles of laughter from downstairs. He gets up and goes to see what's happening]"
1223,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ike?
1224,17,5,Ike Broflovski,[back to his normal voice] Kyle! It's Dora the Explorer!
1225,17,5,Dora,"Come on, let's climb the mountain."
1226,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?"
1227,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"Yaaay! [Kyle is pretty happy too, and joins him on the sofa]"
1228,17,5,Dora,We made it all the way to the top.
1229,17,5,Ike Broflovski,"Oh man, I wouldn't mind hittin' that. I bet she's got that hot Puerto Rican strange. [Kyle's smile vanishes]"
1230,17,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I bet she does."
1231,17,5,Ike Broflovski,Yaaaay!
1232,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[walks in] Hey, everyone? Excuse me! [the other kids start to turn towards him] Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up. [finally has everyone's attention] Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle."
1233,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,About what?!
1234,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller? [a ginger boy with dark red hair leans to his left for a better view] Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology."
1235,17,6,Craig Tucker,Where did you find a red-haired cow?
1236,17,6,Eric Cartman,[crosses his right arm over his chest and points to the doors behind his left shoulder] Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
1237,17,6,Eric Cartman,"There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. [The camera turns right and stops at a cow with a Jewfro, glasses, a freckled face, and huge red polka dots on her body. Cartman laughs at his cleverness]"
1238,17,6,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, look at it!"
1239,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[giggling to himself] You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!"
1240,17,6,Craig Tucker,"[takes out his phone and starts taking pictures] Wow, that's pretty trippy."
1241,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it! [Butters and Kevin take their phones out...] I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! [Jimmy takes out his phone...]"
1242,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Cartman, joke's over. [Kenny takes out his phone]"
1243,17,6,Eric Cartman,What? What joke? This is real!
1244,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
1245,17,6,Eric Cartman,"No, [drops down to the ground] no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong."
1246,17,6,Butters Stotch,"Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake."
1247,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Butters! [laughs to himself]"
1248,17,6,Craig Tucker,"I gotta show this to my mom! [leaves, and the other kids disperse]"
1249,17,6,Butters Stotch,Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! [leaves. Only Kyle remains with Cartman]
1250,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good."
1251,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
1252,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. [walks away]"
1253,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?"
1254,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
1255,17,6,Mr Mackey,Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
1256,17,6,Butters Stotch,"Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?"
1257,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Nothing. [hops off his chair to leave the classroom]
1258,17,6,Butters Stotch,Busted!
1259,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle."
1260,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Wuwhat's going on?
1261,17,6,Principal Victoria,"Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator."
1262,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[glances at the rabbis again] I don't speak Hebrew.
1263,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important. [to the rabbis, in bad English] This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.[Kyle looks at the rabbis]"
1264,17,6,Rabbi 1,[sighs] We're just trying to tell them that we come on very urgent business. [Kyle looks back at Mr. Mackey]
1265,17,6,Mr Mackey,Anything?
1266,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,He said they come on urgent business.
1267,17,6,Principal Victoria,"Ohh, what does he need?"
1268,17,6,Rabbi 2,"Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!"
1269,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!"
1270,17,6,Principal Victoria,"For what? What did he say, Kyle?"
1271,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Please, you must understand! The fate of the world is at stake! [walks to his right and walks over to the window] The coming of a red heifer is the nost holy sign in all of Judaism. It signals the beginning of the End. It is not just our religion, but Islam and Christianity as well. They all agree on one thing. [turns around] That the red heifer means the End of Times."
1272,17,6,Mr Mackey,"You catch any of that, Kyle? [Kyle looks at Mr. Mackey in disbelief]"
1273,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's right over here by uh-
1274,17,6,Rabbi 2,Oh my holy shmear! [a group of Muslims is already bowing down to the cow. One of them notices him and tells him to get out. (!برو بیرون)]
1275,17,6,Rabbi 2,The Muslims! They beat us here! [hops the fence and charges at them. The other two follow suit.]
1276,17,6,Mr Mackey,"[frantic] What's goin' on, Kyle??"
1277,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,He said the Muslims beat them here- [to himself] God damn it!
1278,17,6,Rabbi 2,[arrives next to the cow] Step away! You all know what this means!
1279,17,6,Cleric 1,Yes! And you know you are about to die!
1280,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
1281,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Don't touch it! [they all surround the cow, keeping Kyle and each other away from it]"
1282,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[to a reporter] Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."""
1283,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[trying to reach Cartman, but trapped by the crowd] Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!"
1284,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. [chuckles loudly]"
1285,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,NOOOO!
1286,17,6,Rabbi 4,"[arrives with a sheet of paper, and Rabbi 2 looks at it] The Muslims and the Christians are calling for a meeting to discuss the terms of war."
1287,17,6,Rabbi 2,"Very well, let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends."
1288,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Alright, so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles, no shanks, and no chemical weapons."
1289,17,6,Cleric 2,"If there can be no chemical weapons, then the Christians can use no nuclear weapons. [clamoring follows]"
1290,17,6,Bishop,"Come on, without nuclear weapons, what kind of final Armageddon is this gonna be?! [clamoring follows]"
1291,17,6,Rabbi 3,But couldn't we agree on non-ballistic nuclear weapons only?
1292,17,6,Bishop,"Yeah, I suppose that's fine."
1293,17,6,Cleric 2,That makes sense.
1294,17,6,Rabbi 1,Non-ballistic nuclear only. Alright. Now on to prisoners. Are we all agreeing to decapitations?
1295,17,6,Israeli,Of course we are! What do you think this is?!
1296,17,6,Others,"Yeah, come on! Just get to it!"
1297,17,6,Cleric 3,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! Has anyone noticed something? We are all in a room together. Talking. [walks to the front of the crowd] Has it occurred to anyone else that this prophecy, which amazingly is in all three religions, could actually be meant to bring us together?"
1298,17,6,Bishop,[walks up to him] The prophecy says the red heifer signals the End. [joins him] Could it mean the end of... war?
1299,17,6,Rabbi 1,"If the cow is sacrificed in Israel according to the prophecy, then perhaps it could bring about peace."
1300,17,6,Anderson Cooper,"After all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the Middle East. In the past 48 hours, Jews, Muslims, and Christians have met in Israel to sort out their differences. It may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. And all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the U.S. [the doorbell rings and Kyle goes to answer it]We'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this. [Kyle opens the door and sees that it's Cartman]"
1301,17,6,Eric Cartman,Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
1302,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. [Cartman enters and Kyle closes the door]
1303,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up."
1304,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,No shit!
1305,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it."
1306,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
1307,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[shakes his head] No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!"
1308,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!"
1309,17,6,Eric Cartman,"But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank? [no reply] Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie."
1310,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, go to Hell!"
1311,17,6,Eric Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! [picks up the house phone and starts punching]"
1312,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Wwwait. [Cartman stops]
1313,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Mom?
1314,17,6,Sheila Broflovski,Hi bubbe.
1315,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you."
1316,17,6,Sheila Broflovski,"What is it, Kyle?"
1317,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks down and to his right] You're a fat skank, Mom. [shuts his eyes. Sheila is shocked]"
1318,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[gasps loudly] Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??"
1319,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. [turns and walks out. Cartman's jaw drops.]"
1320,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Ohh my God! [whips out his camera phone and feigns concern] Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?"
1321,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[reaching his locker] Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. [opens his locker and puts a book on top of the stack. Stan, at his neighboring locker, notices]"
1322,17,6,Stan Marsh,How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
1323,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I just... thought it'd be nice.
1324,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[puts another book on the stack] Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework, [puts a third book on the stack] gave me the soda from his lunch. [removes the second and third books he just placed on the stack] I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East. [places the third book back on the stack] Right, Kyle? [puts the second book back in the locker]"
1325,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes sir.
1326,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?"
1327,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes. [sets Cartman's books and backpack on the floor, then walks to the middle of the hallway] I love Cartman's farts."
1328,17,6,Eric Cartman,You what??
1329,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
1330,17,6,Craig Tucker,"Dude, what the hell are you talking about?"
1331,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
1332,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to him] Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle. [Kyle does so, and Cartman backs up onto Kyle's face] Let's see what I can muster up here."
1333,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
1334,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Let's see. Oh! Oh! [farts, then gets off Kyle]"
1335,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[stands up] Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. [turns aroundn and walks away. Cartman smiles. Stan and Kenny can't believe it]
1336,17,6,Stan Marsh,[enunciating] What the fuck?
1337,17,6,Mr Mackey,Come on in.
1338,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[opens the door and walks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?"
1339,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Wuh sure, Kyle. What's the matter?"
1340,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?"
1341,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?"
1342,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[rubs his tears away] Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it. [Cartman sneaks a peek around the open door] I love it sooo sooo much.
1343,17,6,Mr Mackey,Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
1344,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Because they taste so yummy. [his voice quivers]
1345,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that."
1346,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[enters and clears his throat] Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?"
1347,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
1348,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[small gasp] Kyle, are you sure?"
1349,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Please...
1350,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Well alright. [farts into his left hand and cups it over Kyle's mouth, making sure the fart goes all the way in.]"
1351,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy.
1352,17,6,Mr Mackey,Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
1353,17,6,Bishop,"Today... begins the new Israel. [the cleric lifts up a cow bell and rings it, then sets it down] Today, we are all united as one. [the rabbi lights the candle] Chakam balada."
1354,17,6,Crowd,Chakam balada! Chakam balada! [followed by lots of cheering]
1355,17,6,Rabbi 3,"Now, let us celebrate under one symbol! [the clergy go their separate ways and the table sinks into the stage. After several peals of the bell, the floot the table was on returns to the stage as the three religious symbols combine to form... the Van Halen logo. Van Halen's music comes on and the stage lights go on. Eddie Van Halen takes the stage, followed by the rest of Van Halen, with David Lee Roth on mic]"
1356,17,6,Rabbi,No way no waaay!
1357,17,6,Muslim,Epiiic!
1358,17,6,David Lee Roth,"Hello Israel! [launches into ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love""]"
1359,17,6,CNN Reporter,"The party is officially underway. Jews, Christians and Muslims have united, ushering ten years of Van Halen. [archived live footage follows] Out in the crowd, people are celebrating like never before. [nineteen seconds of footage and song follow] No doubt Israel is the happiest, rockingest place to be."
1360,17,6,Stan Marsh,Hey Kyle.
1361,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hey
1362,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too."
1363,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled."
1364,17,6,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?"
1365,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[gets emotional] I just do, Stan."
1366,17,6,Stan Marsh,You like... how they smell? How they taste?
1367,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
1368,17,6,Stan Marsh,They're really that good?
1369,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
1370,17,6,Stan Marsh,Should I try them?
1371,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,NO.
1372,17,6,Ringtone,Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.
1373,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,This is Cartman. I have to take it. [answers his phone] Hello?
1374,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?"
1375,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[keeping quite calm] I don't care.
1376,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?"
1377,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,That's fine. [hangs up]
1378,17,6,Stan Marsh,"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help."
1379,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be."
1380,17,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't get it, Kenny."
1381,17,6,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)"
1382,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head."
1383,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. [begins to reject Cartman's farts in his dreams. A bright light appears and Kyle wakes up, then looks at the foot of his bed]"
1384,17,6,Spirit,Kyle Broflovski.
1385,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Huh? Who...? Who is that?
1386,17,6,Spirit,"Why do you endure all the farts, Kyle?"
1387,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
1388,17,6,Spirit,What you are doing... is the most awesome thing ever.
1389,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I... I know.
1390,17,6,Spirit,Who else would take such torment?
1391,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking."
1392,17,6,Spirit,"You should like, shave your head and get all peaceful about it. Your sacrifice saves the world."
1393,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
1394,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
1395,17,6,CNN Reporter,"[now in party mode - shirtless and with face paint on] What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks! Things just keep getting better here, Tom. And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow, here on stage, and things are gonna go off!"
1396,17,6,Eric Cartman,"You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? [three quick farts]"
1397,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes! Yes I will!
1398,17,6,Eric Cartman,Huh? You comin'? [three more quick ones]
1399,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, whatever you want. [a longer fart]"
1400,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. [leaves, screen right. Kyle stands up]"
1401,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world."
1402,17,6,Butters Stotch,"Just stop, please."
1403,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[dressed in gray pants and white tunic, no footwear] It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. [walks away, screen left]"
1404,17,6,Craig Tucker,Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
1405,17,6,Stan Marsh,Hey Kyle.
1406,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello, Stan."
1407,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop."
1408,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,There are greater things at work than what you understand.
1409,17,6,Stan Marsh,"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it."
1410,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I'm actually the complete opposite.
1411,17,6,Stan Marsh,All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
1412,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place."
1413,17,6,Stan Marsh,See? You sound like a dick.
1414,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[thinks a bit] I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
1415,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick."
1416,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!"
1417,17,6,Stan Marsh,I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
1418,17,6,Kenny McCormick,(Huh? Like what?)
1419,17,6,Stan Marsh,"This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!"
1420,17,6,Rabbi 1,"And now, let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen, Eric Cartman, and his best friend, Fartboy. [Cartman and Kyle come out onstage to great applause. The rabbi gives Cartman the mic]"
1421,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?"
1422,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
1423,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip."
1424,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
1425,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Uh excuse me, I'm sorry everyone, but apparently there's some breaking news in the United States."
1426,17,6,Reporter,"We are in Colorado where the red cow was discovered, and apparently, two boys have shocking news that might change everything."
1427,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been [Stan's phone rings] So- sorry, hang on. [pulls the phone out of his jacket pocket and answers it.] Hello?"
1428,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Do not do this!
1429,17,6,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!"
1430,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!"
1431,17,6,Stan Marsh,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
1432,17,6,Muslim 2,"""Oh"" what? [an Israeli throws up his hands in a shrug]"
1433,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!"
1434,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!"
1435,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!"
1436,17,6,Stan Marsh,"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"""
1437,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry."
1438,17,6,Stan Marsh,You should apologize to Kenny too.
1439,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Kenny!"
1440,17,6,Kenny McCormick,"(That's okay, Kyle.)"
1441,17,6,Rabbi 1,"No, what is the new information?!"
1442,17,6,Stan Marsh,The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
1443,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hurray!
1444,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Oh no, it was a miracle?"
1445,17,6,Israeli 2,"Then, it's not true. The prophecy is not true! [rounds of disappointment as everyone starts leaving]"
1446,17,6,David Lee Roth,"Wait, I thought we were all here because of the prophecy of a miraculous red cow!"
1447,17,6,Rabbi 5,"No, the prophecy is that one day, a fat child with a small penis would decorate a cow to look ginger, not that one would miraculously just fall from the sky. [Kyle is stunned that Cartman fulfilled that prophecy]"
1448,17,6,Muslim 2,I knew this was all too good to be true!
1449,17,6,Bishop,We are associating with these heathens for no reason!
1450,17,6,Eric Cartman,Small penis?!
1451,17,6,Anchor,"The party's over. Muslims, Jews, and Christians are back at each other's throats, and Israel is once again a place of conflict, and turmoil"
1452,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!"
1453,17,6,Rabbi 3,No it di'n't.
1454,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes! It did!
1455,17,6,Rabbi 1,The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.
1456,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!"
1457,17,6,Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems."
1458,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,But it's the truth!
1459,17,6,Eric Cartman,"No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick."
1460,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Sorry boys, but we've gotta get to our fight. There's a rumble at the Wailing Wall. [brings out a switchblade. Rabbi 2 has a shot gun, while rabbi 3 carries a bat]. They leave, and Kyle turns around"
1461,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
1462,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? [puts his hand on his ass and farts on it, then puts whipped cream on it, with a cherry on top, and smothers it on Kyle's face. He then walks away. A few seconds later, the cherry falls off]"
1463,17,7,Guard 1,"The holiday season... is here, and Black Friday... is upon us. As you know, black Friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals. Last year, 26 people died, and 461 were seriously injured. [stops by a guard who lost his right arm, puts his right arm on the guard's left shoulder and closes his eyes for a moment, then moves on] This winter the mall is offering 80% off to the first thirty people in the store. [The guards shout out various responses] For you new recruits, perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was like. [a closeup of a guard without a chin] Or perhaps you thought workin' Black Friday wouldn't be a big deal. [looks at Randy, who just smiles innocently]"
1464,17,7,Randy Marsh,I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
1465,17,7,Guard 1,[ominously] Or maybe you're just too stupid to realize what you've gotten yourselves into.
1466,17,7,Chief of Security,"That's enough! [the other guards turn to see him, an old guard with a scar over his left eye, and his back to them] Our only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together! Those of you who signed up are to be... commended. [turns around] But I warn you: do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doors! [the other guards stay silent, and he turns towards the front entrance.] Winter is coming."
1467,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick."
1468,17,7,Kenny McCormick,[looks around the living room] (She's not here right now.)
1469,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it."
1470,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig and mumbles coyly]. Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves."
1471,17,7,Clyde Donovan,Which nobody can afford.
1472,17,7,Eric Cartman,What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
1473,17,7,Token Black,"If you know of a way, wizard, then speak."
1474,17,7,Eric Cartman,"I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday."
1475,17,7,Butters Stotch,"Woo, spooky."
1476,17,7,Craig Tucker,"Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real."
1477,17,7,Eric Cartman,"It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!"
1478,17,7,Stan Marsh,[stands on his chair] It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
1479,17,7,Eric Cartman,"On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together! [pounds the table with his left fist] ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive."
1480,17,7,Male Anchor,"Well it's almost Thanksgiving, and we all know what that means."
1481,17,7,Female Anchor,That's right. Black Friday is right around the corner.
1482,17,7,Male Anchor,Ouch.
1483,17,7,Female Anchor,And people are already gearing up. [cut to shoppers]
1484,17,7,Shopper 1,"[obese man with only one tooth] We usually start linin' up around 3 am. We uh douse ourselves in pig blood, because it does help us slip through the crowd when the doors open."
1485,17,7,Shopper 2,"[with his family] We do it every year, part of the family tradition. Last year we lost our youngest daughter. Her head was stepped on and crushed, but, in her memory, we're going to find a young girl and step on her head this year."
1486,17,7,Shopper 3,"[an angry obese woman with two fat kids behind her] If anyone thinks they're gonna beat me inside that mall, and keep me from gettin' [points to her younger kid] my kids Christmas presents, they can kiss my fat vagina, 'cause I'm bringin' the motherfuckin' pain! [bares her teeth]"
1487,17,7,Reporter,"Tom, the South Park Mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously."
1488,17,7,Eric Cartman,"[walking around, surveying his knights] Yes. Yes, very nice. Good."
1489,17,7,Butters Stotch,"[runs up with a sheet of paper and hands it to Cartman] Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! [salutes with his left hand]"
1490,17,7,Eric Cartman,"[flatly, but sternly] They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters."
1491,17,7,Butters Stotch,"[lowers his hand] Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet."
1492,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, we need to start immediately, please. [clears his throat and reads] Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!"
1493,17,7,Stan Marsh,The House of Greyhawk?
1494,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,Larry and Brad Stoltsky
1495,17,7,Eric Cartman,"But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?"
1496,17,7,Clyde Donovan,"[raises his left hand] Hey yeah, I know. [lowers it] How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?"
1497,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them."
1498,17,7,Randy Marsh,"[walks up] Hey, [notices the flask] that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that? [the guard shares his flask] Oh, thanks! [sits down near the guard] Gets a little boring around here, you know? [takes a swig from the flask]"
1499,17,7,Guard 2,Enjoy the boredom while you can.
1500,17,7,Randy Marsh,So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? [hands the flask back to the guard]
1501,17,7,Guard 2,I did.
1502,17,7,Randy Marsh,Is it really as bad as they say it is?
1503,17,7,Guard 2,"The shoppers... Hm... They started showing up at midnight on Thursday... They... didn't line up, they just crammed themselves near the main entrance... I can see their faces smooshed up against the glass, licking their lips, waiting to get in... God, the sounds that they made... It was 5 am when they opened the doors... There was screaming... blood... people... tearing each other's faces off while holiday music played in the background... I saw a woman... pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guy's head... Before I knew it they were all around me... fighting, clawing. Then a hand reached in and pulled me out. Old Cap. He saved us all that day. [A shot of the chief of security] When it was over... the front of the mall was... covered in red. Bodies... shopping bags... [a shot of the banner again] And now winter comes again. [after a few seconds of reflection, he quickly drinks the rest of the flask]"
1504,17,7,Butters Stotch,"Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones."
1505,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?"
1506,17,7,Butters Stotch,"Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?"
1507,17,7,Eric Cartman,What do you mean?
1508,17,7,Butters Stotch,"Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?"
1509,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters."
1510,17,7,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all."
1511,17,7,Eric Cartman,We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! [the boys cheer this good news]
1512,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
1513,17,7,Boys,Yeah!
1514,17,7,Craig Tucker,"Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? [everyone's smiles vanish]"
1515,17,7,Eric Cartman,"That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday."
1516,17,7,Craig Tucker,I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
1517,17,7,Eric Cartman,[chortles] What?
1518,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,M ma um m-me too.
1519,17,7,Eric Cartman,"...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes."
1520,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
1521,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox."
1522,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system."
1523,17,7,Eric Cartman,That's right.
1524,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,"If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine."
1525,17,7,Craig Tucker,Right. Let's all get PS4s.
1526,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[taken aback] No, the XBox's are gonna be better."
1527,17,7,Tweek Tweak,"They're not better, they're just more expensive."
1528,17,7,Eric Cartman,"We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!"
1529,17,7,Craig Tucker,That's exactly how XBox people are!
1530,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,Yeah!
1531,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!"
1532,17,7,Craig Tucker,"We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!"
1533,17,7,Eric Cartman,"[thinks for a moment] Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!"
1534,17,7,Craig Tucker,"Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! [Fosse joins Craig and Tweek, followed soon after by Jimmy and two other boys. Bill and Jason join them as well, while Scott joins the XBox group]"
1535,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No! We can't divide like this! [Stan leaves the XBox group] Stan? [Stan turns around] You're on our side, right?"
1536,17,7,Stan Marsh,I like the PS4's controller better.
1537,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[stunned, then] Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One."
1538,17,7,Stan Marsh,"[tears welling up] The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because... [gets mad] because that's how XBox people are."
1539,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,[determined] Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
1540,17,7,Stan Marsh,"[determined] If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside."
1541,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,I know.
1542,17,7,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle] Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. [turns around and walks away with the XBox group, with Kyle joining him. A shot of the mall as day turns to night]"
1543,17,7,Randy Marsh,"[singing to himself] Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat. [opens the front door and enters, closes the door and sets the keys on a small table] Please to put a penny in the old man's-"
1544,17,7,Sharon Marsh,"[waiting for him by the sofa, with her arms crossed] What the hell are you doing?"
1545,17,7,Randy Marsh,"[stops] Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash."
1546,17,7,Sharon Marsh,Bullshit.
1547,17,7,Randy Marsh,"I did, Sharon. [begins walking past her] I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money."
1548,17,7,Sharon Marsh,"[stands up and follows Randy for a few steps] You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?"
1549,17,7,Randy Marsh,"[goes onto the first stair step and thinks of his reply, then turns around] Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!"
1550,17,7,Sharon Marsh,Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
1551,17,7,Randy Marsh,"Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee. [flaps his right hand like a wing] Bzzz bzzz. [goes on up the stairs]"
1552,17,7,Ensign,"Thrusters are at 20%, captain."
1553,17,7,Kevin Stoley,"Engage, ensign. Warp factor 1."
1554,17,7,Dougie,"Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman."
1555,17,7,Kevin Stoley,On screen. [the monitor on the floor lights up and Cartman is seen.]
1556,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?"
1557,17,7,Kevin Stoley,Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.
1558,17,7,Eric Cartman,[to Clyde] God these guys are such dorks!
1559,17,7,Clyde Donovan,Just find out who they're loyal to.
1560,17,7,Eric Cartman,"[performs the Vulcan sign for goodbye] Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?"
1561,17,7,Kevin Stoley,"Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet."
1562,17,7,Eric Cartman,"[to Clyde] Oh my god they're so gaaay! [to the Trekkers] Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap."
1563,17,7,Dougie,Cheap XBox Ones? For real?
1564,17,7,Eric Cartman,"The Federation has agreed to fight with us! [the group gathers at a round table] With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size! [Kyle sadly nods in acknowledgement] You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?"
1565,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
1566,17,7,Eric Cartman,"You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances."
1567,17,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. [closes his case by crossing his arms]"
1568,17,7,Eric Cartman,"[with his right hand over his nose] Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners."
1569,17,7,Butters Stotch,I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
1570,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,"This isn't helping us, Butters!"
1571,17,7,Clyde Donovan,The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
1572,17,7,Kenny McCormick,(What do you mean?)
1573,17,7,Clyde Donovan,Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
1574,17,7,Eric Cartman,What new Elmo doll?
1575,17,7,Elmo,"[pops into view] Heheh, who, me?"
1576,17,7,Announcer,"[a blonde girl unwraps her gift] Just in time for the holidays, it's Stop Touching Me Elmo. [the girl shows him to the camera] When you press his back, Elmo puts his hand on your knee and says fun things. [a boy demonstrates this]"
1577,17,7,Elmo,"Have you ever been tickled on the inside? [next, the blonde girl is asleep with it] I'm lonely. Are you lonely? [she wakes up. Next is a boy in his own bedroom room] Can I watch you go potty? [the boy looks at the doll. Next is a brunet girl with curly hair] You wanna kiss the guy who does Elmo's voice? [the doll puts his hand on the girl's knee. This alarms her]"
1578,17,7,Girl,"Stop touching me, Elmo! [swats his arm away. He tries again and she stops him sooner. He tries again...]"
1579,17,7,Announcer,Elmo also helps kids brush their teeth with his toothpaste dispenser. [a shot of a boy putting toothpaste onto his toothbrush from Elmo's groin]
1580,17,7,Elmo,More! More! More! Aaaghghgh.
1581,17,7,Announcer,"Don't miss out on this holiday season's biggest gift! Stop touching me, Elmo!"
1582,17,7,Announcer 2,Available at South Park Mall staring Black Friday.
1583,17,7,Randy Marsh,"Morning, Joe, Marcus."
1584,17,7,Guard 3,"Morning, Randy."
1585,17,7,Old Cap,What madness is this?? [Randy and the other two guards walk over.]
1586,17,7,Randy Marsh,What is it?
1587,17,7,Old Cap,[reads from an announcement] A new Elmo doll. They're releasing a new Emo doll [rolls up the announcement] just in time for Black Friday.
1588,17,7,Guard 3,"Oh Christ, no!"
1589,17,7,Old Cap,"You've murdered us! [looks up at some business people in front of a Toy Safari store] You soulless monsters, you've killed us all! [some knocking is heard from the main entrance. The guards look to their right and see the crowd beginning to form outside]"
1590,17,7,Guard 4,"Oh, God, they're already lining up."
1591,17,7,Shopper 1,Eelllmoooo
1592,17,7,Guard 3,No! They can't line up this soon! This is crazy!
1593,17,7,Old Cap,"I'll deal with these demons! [walks towards the entrance, opens the doors, and walks out. The doors close and he addresses the crowd] If you are here for Black Friday, the line starts on that side of the rope. [shows them the rope. which has a small sign saying ""BLACK FRIDAY LINE"" on one of the poles]"
1594,17,7,Shopper 4,Oh. This rope right here? [walks over to the rope. The rest of the crowd follows him and stand behind the rope]
1595,17,7,Old Cap,"That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today."
1596,17,7,Shopper 4,Oh. Okay. Thanks. [Old Cap goes inside and the shoppers resume knocking on the glass walls.]
1597,17,7,Shopper 4,Elmooo.
1598,17,7,Shopper 5,Give me Elmo.
1599,17,7,Stan Marsh,"We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?"
1600,17,7,Michael,Are you for real?
1601,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,"You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on."
1602,17,7,Michael,Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!
1603,17,7,Stan Marsh,Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
1604,17,7,Pete,"Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available."
1605,17,7,Stan Marsh,"No, you can't do that!"
1606,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Ya yo you can't, you can't do that."
1607,17,7,Stan Marsh,"Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS."
1608,17,7,Henrietta Biggle,What's Betamax?
1609,17,7,Stan Marsh,Exactly!
1610,17,7,Pete,What's VHS?
1611,17,7,Stan Marsh,"...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!"
1612,17,7,Michael,"Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough."
1613,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. [turns right and walks away. Craig follows, and Stan looks at the floor, saddened]"
1614,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle."
1615,17,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Yes. What's up, my lord?)"
1616,17,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever... [picks out a yellow rose and gives it to Kenny] switch sides, [Kenny sniffs it] it could make Stan's army problematic for us."
1617,17,7,Kenny McCormick,(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
1618,17,7,Eric Cartman,"True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours. [stops and faces Kenny] Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors."
1619,17,7,Kenny McCormick,[strokes his mouse] (Yes. That's right.) [they resume the walk]
1620,17,7,Eric Cartman,"You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?"
1621,17,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Yes, I believe we do.)"
1622,17,7,Man,"Hey, you damned kids! [Cartman and Kenny turn to face the voice, which turns out to be a man looking out his bedroom window on the second floor of his house] Get the hell out of my yard!"
1623,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!"
1624,17,7,Man,"No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!"
1625,17,7,Randy Marsh,"Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both."
1626,17,7,Voice,"Doin' alright there, Rookie? [A hand falls on Randy's left shoulder, startling him]"
1627,17,7,Randy Marsh,Whoa! Haha. [recognizing Old Cap] Yes sir!
1628,17,7,Old Cap,"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
1629,17,7,Randy Marsh,"No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh."
1630,17,7,Old Cap,"Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job."
1631,17,7,Randy Marsh,"You-d, you do?"
1632,17,7,Old Cap,"I see it in you. You care about people. [smiles] Same reason I do it every year. [takes Randy for a walk] You remind me of my son. He died on Black Friday in '89. Guess I'm still trying to save him. [stops] Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay."
1633,17,7,Randy Marsh,[going with it] Yeah... awesome...
1634,17,7,Old Cap,"No, damn it! [noticing something outside] No lining up behind the velvet rope! [goes towards the entrance] God they just don't listen! [Randy sighs and buzzes to himself more soberly]"
1635,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,"C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club."
1636,17,7,Craig Tucker,"Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well."
1637,17,7,Stan Marsh,And who do we have on our side?
1638,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton."
1639,17,7,Stan Marsh,Did you ask the Vamp kids?
1640,17,7,Craig Tucker,They're still undecided.
1641,17,7,Stan Marsh,"[walks towards the tent's entrance] There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. [looks at the campfire outside, around which sit Tweek and two other boys]"
1642,17,7,Boy,Playstation...
1643,17,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up."
1644,17,7,Craig Tucker,"We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing."
1645,17,7,Stan Marsh,So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
1646,17,7,Corporate Head and Board Members,"Huh? Isogashii yo! [I'm busy!""]"
1647,17,7,Member 1,"Sorry to disturb you sir, but we thought you should see this. [pulls out a flier]"
1648,17,7,Corporate Head and Board Members,"[gets down from his desk and puts on his robe] Omae-ya kikei [""You freak""]. [the woman gets off the table and skulks away while the corporate head walks to the board members] Jishu, taihen ne. [""Geez, how dreadful""] [takes the flier and looks at it. It's a flier Cartman had made up and distributed everywhere, even Japan] Winter is comingu. Choose side-o. Nani kore? [""What is this?""]"
1649,17,7,Member 1,"Just a small down in Middle America, but apparently, a war is escalating."
1650,17,7,Member 2,"Sir, if this were to become a news story, and if the first people inside their mall all got XBoxes... well it clearly looks bad for our image."
1651,17,7,Corporate Head and Board Members,"[looks more closely at the flier] So desu ne... [""I see...""]"
1652,17,7,Reporter 2,"What's going to be the big item everyone goes for this Black Friday? It just might be the PlayStation 4. Sony has just announced they offering a special Black Friday bundle, called the ""Brack Friday Bunduru,"" which will include four controllers, a map of Japan, a hundred dollar rebate, and, allow you to automatically pre-order for Metal Gear Solid V. No doubt Sony has just raised the stakes."
1653,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners! [walks further along to Kyle, who's sitting on a tree stump.] Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?"
1654,17,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?"
1655,17,7,Eric Cartman,"Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth."
1656,17,7,Randy Marsh,"Alright, listen up. [the crowd quiets down] The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night. [the clamoring resumes] It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands. [the crowd knocks down the rope and overwhelms him] Augh! Hold on! Oh God!"
1657,17,7,Shopper 6,Wristbands!
1658,17,7,Old Cap,"[sees the commotion and arrives to restore order] Back! Back, all of you! [the other guards come to help out] If that's how you are, there'll be no wristbands! No go! [delivers a left jab to a woman in front of him]"
1659,17,7,Shopper 7,Oh!
1660,17,7,Old Cap,Back away! [Shopper 1 comes up behind him and stabs him]
1661,17,7,Shopper 4,"I'm getting my son that Elmo doll, you fuck! [pulls the knife out and rushes away. Old Cap collapses]"
1662,17,7,Randy Marsh,"No! [runs to Old Cap's side as more guards exit the mall. Randy reaches him first, and the other guards gather around them]"
1663,17,7,Old Cap,You did good. The watch is yours now.
1664,17,7,Randy Marsh,No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
1665,17,7,Old Cap,"This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend?"
1666,17,7,Randy Marsh,"No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday."
1667,17,7,Old Cap,"Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this. [puts his hand over his left eye and... pulls off what turns out to be an adhesive eye patch and places it on Randy's left eye] Don't let... Black Friday... be the end. [dies. The other guards stay around, not knowing what to do]"
1668,17,7,Randy Marsh,[rises] Get back inside. We have work to do. [the guards file back into the mall]
1669,17,7,Stan Marsh,"When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own! [the army is shown, and it includes the Goths, the Vamps, the handicapped kids, and some first graders. The house behind them only has one story, and it looks run down. A security grill is falling off one of the windows and the fence is in tatters. The army cheers for itself] I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided. [more cheering. A familiar figure sits on a throne...] Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! [he turns around and unsheathes his sword, raising it to honor the new leader]All hail the Princess! [points the sword at her, and more cheering follows. Princess Kenny, Lady McCormick, has arrived]"
1670,17,7,PS4 Army,"The Princess! Yeah! [a mouse crawls into view, on the Princess's left shoulder, and roars]"
1671,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"Previously, on South Park."
1672,17,8,Narrator,"Now let me tell you, child, of a war that is about to come. [turns out the wall is the two consoles over which the war will be fought - the PS4 and the XBox - and the crow is on the display for the XBox One.] Since time unremembered there have been two. [the crow hops from the XBox One display to the PS4 display] One dark and unforgiving, the other pure and filled with light. [next is a silhouette of a woman looking at South Park Mall from a pile of rocks] At the dawn of war, I stand alone, looking out at would be the last battlefield, for winter is coming, and I... am a princess. [the woman is Princess Kenny] Once a common lady of the dark army, but, denied my right to be called princess by birth, [Kenny hops off the rocks and walks] I've betrayed my kind, [Kenny enters EVGames] and now I have chosen my side: that which I believe is best for all, [Kenny flips through the games and chooses Vomit Cops, then plays it] for it has the dual-shock controller with a speakers and a touchpad interface. [Kenny walks home] Our land is split in two, brother against brother, friend versus friend. [enters his house and walks past his parents] My parents will fight on Black Friday as well. For what? I do not know."
1673,17,8,Stuart McCormick,What the hell is he wearin' now?
1674,17,8,Narrator,"[walks out to the back yard and sits on her throne] My followers, though few in number, shall help see me through until I am finally accepted as a princess by all. I cannot rest, for I know that even now, the enemy is training for battle, also preparing for winter."
1675,17,8,Scott Malkinson,"En garde! [Butters takes up his sword and swordplay resumes. While the crowd cheers the swords-boys on, Cartman is not impressed, and he buries his nose in his hand while squeezing his eyes shut]"
1676,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, stop, stop, stop! [leaves his chair and walks up to Scott and Butters] This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! [swings his staff at Scott's mouth and lands it, making Scott's tongue go back in his mouth]"
1677,17,8,Scott Malkinson,Aaah God ow sorry...
1678,17,8,Eric Cartman,"There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! [leaves]"
1679,17,8,Butters Stotch,"[not sure what to do next, then swats Scott on his back] Yeah!"
1680,17,8,Scott Malkinson,[falls onto his knees] Ah!
1681,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[catches up to Cartman] Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances."
1682,17,8,Eric Cartman,"The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training."
1683,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday."
1684,17,8,Eric Cartman,"That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him! [they go through the sliding door] I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"" [reaches his refrigerator and opens it, looking for something to consume]"
1685,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Sony released the PS4s, Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them."
1686,17,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around, holding a glass of milk] I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru! [takes a swig of it] Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. [leaves, forgetting to close the refrigerator door]"
1687,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Stupid asshole! [looks at a picture of himself and Kenny at Casa Bonita putting their arms around each other, with dreamy expressions, as they used to be best buds. He folds it up and lays it on his desk, face down] Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard. [lost his patience] Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!"
1688,17,8,Steve Ballmer's Secretary,"Mr. Ballmer, John and Dave from Marketing are here to see you. [the men come on in]"
1689,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Yes, hello. How are things going out there?"
1690,17,8,John,"Sir, the tides of war are changing."
1691,17,8,Dave,"There's a king in Colorado, a young wizard who believes that Sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid."
1692,17,8,John,"He claims that with our help, his followers are prepared to fight to the death over which system is better."
1693,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Uhh, what are you guys talking about? You sound ridiculous."
1694,17,8,Dave,"[looks at John, then] There's... going to be a war in this small town on Black Friday, and it's all over the news!"
1695,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Guys, these are console wars, not some epic battle for a kingdom. I mean, come on."
1696,17,8,Dave,"...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping-"
1697,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Guys, guys guys! It's just a video game machine, alright? Microsoft's a company that... tries to be above all the petty commercialism, okay?"
1698,17,8,Dave,Ok-Okay.
1699,17,8,John,Okay. [they turn and leave]
1700,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality."
1701,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Niles Lawson is on the scene, and Niles, what are you hearing?"
1702,17,8,Niles Lawson,"[holding in his left arm a giant candy cane, with blood stains along the hooked end] Tom, tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer Miles ""Happy"" Davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for Black Friday until Thursday night. In honor of the slain mall security officer, the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off Black Friday deals!"
1703,17,8,Randy Marsh,Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
1704,17,8,Guard 3,[runs up to Randy] Captain! Captain! The mall is dropping the Black Friday sale another 10%.
1705,17,8,Guard 4,What?
1706,17,8,Guard 5,Oh my God.
1707,17,8,Guard 6,They can't do that!
1708,17,8,Guard 7,What? That's 90% off!
1709,17,8,Guard 8,Oh God! They're back! The shoppers are back! [the camera pulls back to reveal a large crowd of shoppers slowly moving towards the mall. One of them holds a flyer for the new Black Friday deal. The fog is so low it looks soupy]
1710,17,8,Randy Marsh,Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. [exits the mall]
1711,17,8,Randy Marsh,"[through a bullhorn] If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving."
1712,17,8,Shopper 6,We're not on mall property.
1713,17,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, you're about to be."
1714,17,8,Shopper 6,"Well, what if we just walk really, really slow? [the crowd slows it's walk further, growls spread among them, as they start to resemble a White Walker's] Black Friday!"
1715,17,8,Randy Marsh,You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
1716,17,8,Shopper 7,We can walk really slow. Look. [the shoppers start to shamble and quietly moan in a full parody of a White Walker army]
1717,17,8,Randy Marsh,Smartasses. [turns around and goes inside the mall]
1718,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick."
1719,17,8,Butters Stotch,"You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?"
1720,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him. [picks a rose out for Butters, just as he did for Kenny before.] How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?"
1721,17,8,Butters Stotch,They don't!
1722,17,8,Eric Cartman,Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
1723,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I finished it!"
1724,17,8,Eric Cartman,So what happens when the dragons show up?
1725,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!"
1726,17,8,Eric Cartman,Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
1727,17,8,Butters Stotch,Wha-what do you want me to do?
1728,17,8,Eric Cartman,Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
1729,17,8,Butters Stotch,Who's George R. R. Martin?
1730,17,8,Eric Cartman,"He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors."
1731,17,8,Homeowner,Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damn yard!
1732,17,8,Eric Cartman,[shoots back] Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
1733,17,8,Homeowner,"Yeah?! Well how come every time you talk to somebody, it's about betraying somebody else?!"
1734,17,8,Eric Cartman,Why don't you mind your own business?!
1735,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"No. Listen, for the last time, we don't have any dragons to send them. If some people wanna choose PlayStations, it's their choice. [a knock is heard]"
1736,17,8,Steve Ballmer's Secretary,"Sir, Mr. Gates is here."
1737,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Bill Gates? [to the caller] Uh, I gotta go. [hangs up, rises from his seat, goes around the desk, and greets Bill Gates] Hey heeey! Bill Gates actually showing up at Corporate."
1738,17,8,Bill Gates,"[shaking hands] Hey Steve, how're you doin'?"
1739,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Not bad, you know? Just tryin' to get this next gen press stuff handled."
1740,17,8,Bill Gates,"I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?"
1741,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Oh it's- no, it turns out it was nothing, just some kids tryin' to turn the console wars into somethin' bigger."
1742,17,8,Bill Gates,"Oh my gosh. You know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you."
1743,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Yeah, well, nothin' I can't handle. [a man dressed in black appears behind him] There might be some changes we need to make to our marketing, but I'm optimistic. [the man approaches Steve.]"
1744,17,8,Bill Gates,Uh huh.
1745,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"You know, I think we'll ultimately sell the number of units we want to. [the man takes out a dagger and gets closer]"
1746,17,8,Bill Gates,"You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made. [the hitman reaches around and stabs Ballmer through the chest and drags the dagger to the right, cutting open Ballmer's chest even more. Ballmer cries out, but is choking in his blood. Ballmer steps backwards and falls on his back gasping for air. Gates takes a glass of wine to a sofa and sits down to look at Ballmer] Do you know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve. [Ballmer takes his last gasps as Gates walks out of the CEO's office. Gates addresses Ballmer's men] Clean that shit up."
1747,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Well come on, Scott. You're lagging."
1748,17,8,Scott Malkinson,I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
1749,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. [Butters and Scott stand in front of a mansion gate somewhere in the Southwest. Cacti abound on either side of the high fence. Butters reaches up and presses a buzzer]"
1750,17,8,Butler,[through the intercom] Can I help you?
1751,17,8,Butters Stotch,Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
1752,17,8,Butler,"Who is this, please?"
1753,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up? [two seconds of silence] Hello?"
1754,17,8,Butler,"I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans."
1755,17,8,Butters Stotch,We're not fans!
1756,17,8,Scott Malkinson,"Yeah, we don't like it!"
1757,17,8,Butters Stotch,"We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!"
1758,17,8,Butler,About what?
1759,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! [the buzzer sounds again and the gates open. Butters and Scott go inside and towards the front door. George R. R. Martin steps outside to greet them]"
1760,17,8,GRRM,"It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?"
1761,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up."
1762,17,8,GRRM,Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.
1763,17,8,Butters Stotch,When?
1764,17,8,GRRM,You really wanna know?
1765,17,8,Butters Stotch,[sternly] Please. It's urgent.
1766,17,8,GRRM,"Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight."
1767,17,8,Butters Stotch,"No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?"
1768,17,8,Scott Malkinson,"Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint."
1769,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh what's the matter, Scott?"
1770,17,8,Scott Malkinson,I told you I have to eat every two hours.
1771,17,8,Butters Stotch,He's diabetic.
1772,17,8,GRRM,"Oh Jeez, uh, why don't you kids come out from the cold? I'll order some pizzas."
1773,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Okay, thanks."
1774,17,8,GRRM,Come on in! I'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in Game of Thrones. [leads the boys inside]
1775,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan."
1776,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong."
1777,17,8,Eric Cartman,"It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army [picks a rose out for Kyle], but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation. [Kyle sniffs the rose] It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be... [stops] grounded?"
1778,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,Grounded? For what?
1779,17,8,Eric Cartman,That could be up to you.
1780,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!"
1781,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right. [begins walking] Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?"
1782,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1783,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Seems a little convenient, doesn't it? [stops and faces Kyle] Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors."
1784,17,8,Homeowner,Don't believe it! [Cartman and Kyle look at the homeowner] He said that to a bunch of people!
1785,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!"
1786,17,8,Homeowner,You're callin' the cops?!
1787,17,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
1788,17,8,Homeowner,You're on my property! I'm callin' the cops!
1789,17,8,Eric Cartman,Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
1790,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"[startled] Oh oh! [calms down] Oh, it's you."
1791,17,8,Niles Lawson,"Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report."
1792,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,We don't go to work for another hour.
1793,17,8,Niles Lawson,[walks to the foot of the bed] We just got a call from Bill Gates. [sits down] He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday if we play along.
1794,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,He wants us to side with him?
1795,17,8,Niles Lawson,"That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better."
1796,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!"
1797,17,8,Niles Lawson,"Right, Tom. Because you're sooo about integrity. Let's go. [stands up and walks to the doorway, then turns around] Or maybe I should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to! Back to you!"
1798,17,8,9 News Announcer,"It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson. Colorado's top-rated brother-sister news team."
1799,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there."
1800,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise."
1801,17,8,Niles Lawson,"Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking, and none other than Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger. [Bill Gates appears]"
1802,17,8,Bill Gates,"That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers."
1803,17,8,Niles Lawson,We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.
1804,17,8,Bill Gates,"Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety."
1805,17,8,Mrs McCormick,[answers the door] Yes?
1806,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Hi, is Kenny home?"
1807,17,8,Mrs McCormick,"Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends."
1808,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Forward, men! [the bearers try to fit Cartman through the door, but they can't fir through. First they run into the door frame on the left side] That, no- [then on the right] No, you- You've gotta turn me. [the bearers tilt the litter some seventy degrees without Cartman falling off and finally fit through the door.]"
1809,17,8,Jimmy Valmer,It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! [other soldiers rally]
1810,17,8,Other kids,Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!
1811,17,8,Eric Cartman,"I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?"
1812,17,8,Stan Marsh,Let them pass! [the PS4 army makes way for the XBox army. Cartman is carried over to Kenny's throne]
1813,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)"
1814,17,8,Stan Marsh,[translating] The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
1815,17,8,Eric Cartman,"You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday."
1816,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)"
1817,17,8,Stan Marsh,"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it."
1818,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!"
1819,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"(What?!) [fans himself] (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)"
1820,17,8,Stan Marsh,The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
1821,17,8,Eric Cartman,That doesn't even make sense.
1822,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps forward] Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control."
1823,17,8,Stan Marsh,What I started? How dare you!
1824,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
1825,17,8,Stan Marsh,"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!"
1826,17,8,Eric Cartman,"You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! [Stan and Kenny look at each other, then Stan thinks a minute]"
1827,17,8,Stan Marsh,The gods will find us a way!
1828,17,8,GRRM,"So then Samwell Tarly sees the army approaching, and his wiener is about this big. [about 18 inches, by his estimate. Butters is losing patience as Scott fades] He knows that Stannis Baratheon's wiener is probably shriveled from the cold. Samwell has to rally his men, so what does he do? He takes out his wiener [unzips his pants and demonstrates his story] and he dangles it around for all his men to see. [shakes his hips and pretends his wiener is a bell]"
1829,17,8,Scott Malkinson,AAAH! [turns away for a moment]
1830,17,8,Butters Stotch,"OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!"
1831,17,8,GRRM,"Yeah yeah, they're on their way. They're still coming. So Samwell's wiener goes [shakes his hips around as if his wiener were a bell and makes sounds for it]"
1832,17,8,Butters Stotch,But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! [Scott had said he needs to eat every two hours]
1833,17,8,Scott Malkinson,"If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out."
1834,17,8,GRRM,"[zips up] Don't worry. They're coming. Pizzas are on their way. They're gonna be amazing. [picks up where he was interrupted] Now, John Snow finally faces Jaime Lannister, and this guy's wiener is, you know, huge, right? So it's not goin' to be easy."
1835,17,8,Scott Malkinson,Ehhh...
1836,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday."
1837,17,8,Bill Gates,"Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?"
1838,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help. [picks another yellow rose for Gates] But I hope that we're clear that this is my army. [hands the rose to him. Gates sniffs it] There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules."
1839,17,8,Bill Gates,"Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want."
1840,17,8,Eric Cartman,Your CEOs?
1841,17,8,Bill Gates,"Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors."
1842,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Uhhh, hmmm. What?"
1843,17,8,Homeowner,[from his bedroom window] Hahaa! How's it feel?! Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?!
1844,17,8,Eric Cartman,Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
1845,17,8,Homeowner,Why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard?! [slams his window shut]
1846,17,8,President of Sony,"Ish, ish, ish, o-ish, haishooo! [quickly sits up to deliver the final thrust, then collapses onto his bed. He then rolls over on his back, revealing whom he was having sex with]"
1847,17,8,Niles Lawson,[with mic in hand] That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely. How about you?
1848,17,8,President of Sony,"[gets a cigarette and lights it.] Tanoshikatta ne. (Yeah, it was fun.)"
1849,17,8,Niles Lawson,"You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided."
1850,17,8,President of Sony,"Eh? Nani kore, tsukareta yo. (What? I'm tired!)"
1851,17,8,Niles Lawson,Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.
1852,17,8,President of Sony,"Hai. [""Yes."" He reaches over to his left and grabs a box] Kore ga arimasu. [""Here it is"" He opens the box and something begins to glow inside]"
1853,17,8,Niles Lawson,"[leans in to see what it is] Yes, I think that will do nicely."
1854,17,8,Chorus,"[Classical men's ensemble singing in musical round style, as GRRM conducts.]
'Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener [continues in background]"
1855,17,8,Soloist,"One wiener, next to another wiener"
1856,17,8,Chorus,"Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener [continues in background]"
1857,17,8,Soloist,Two wieners alongside yet another wiener
1858,17,8,Chorus,"Party, wiener party, wiener party, party party, wiener party, wiener wiener [continues in background]"
1859,17,8,Soloist,"Soft wieners, nice and soft, non-erect wieners!"
1860,17,8,Chorus,"Keep them flopping, flopping wieners, floppy floppy, dangle wieners, dangle dangle [continues in background]"
1861,17,8,Soloist,Five wieners in my face
1862,17,8,Scott Malkinson,Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! [Chorus is silent]
1863,17,8,GRRM,"But this is the best part. Right before King Joffrey gets poisoned, everyone flaps their wieners all around his face."
1864,17,8,Scott Malkinson,Jeaaaaah!
1865,17,8,Butters Stotch,"[gets off the sofa] Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!"
1866,17,8,GRRM,"Okay, okay, fine fine. What kind of pizzas do you want?"
1867,17,8,Butters Stotch,What kind do we want?!
1868,17,8,Scott Malkinson,He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!
1869,17,8,GRRM,"Don't worry! They're coming! Not just two pizzas, there's, there's gonna be five! And they're gonna be huge! You won't believe it!"
1870,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Come on, Scott! We're leaving! [helps Scott off the sofa, and they're about to leave]"
1871,17,8,GRRM,"Wait, I haven't told you what happens yet!"
1872,17,8,Butters Stotch,"NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!"
1873,17,8,GRRM,Well why didn't you say so? I can help with that.
1874,17,8,Butters Stotch,Whatoyou mean?
1875,17,8,GRRM,I'll make some calls. I know a way to make sure you're completely prepared for Black Friday! [starts dialing]
1876,17,8,President of Sony,"Sony PS4 no urazuke. Zenbu. Domo sumimasen. [""For your support of the Sony PS4, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all of you""]"
1877,17,8,Sony Aide,The President of Sony bids you thanks for all your support of the PS4.
1878,17,8,President of Sony,"Sore kara kono gifuto de Princess no Pawaa agemashou [""After that, let us give you this gift, the Power of the Princess""]"
1879,17,8,Sony Aide,"He offers you this gift to once and for all make you an official Princess, and to give you the powers you need to win this war on Black Friday. [The president kneels, opens the box, and shows off the brooch resting within it. Kenny leaves the throne and takes the brooch from its box]"
1880,17,8,President of Sony,"Ima kara [""From now on""]... Princess Kenny!"
1881,17,8,Craig Tucker,"Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess."
1882,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"(Wooo!) [as J-pop music plays, Kenny's backyard is transformed. The makeshift thrown becomes a gazebo with a unicorn bust on top, Kenny gets a magical girl look, with big anime eyes, and gets the power of the rainbow, with bubbles, etc. He gets a pet unicorn. The whole scene could be an intro for a Princess Kenny show.]"
1883,17,8,Guard 9,Oh God. We're done for!
1884,17,8,Randy Marsh,"My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us. [his phone rings and he picks up] Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!"
1885,17,8,Niles Lawson,"Tom, we have breaking news from the South Park mall. In an effort to make sure everyone is prepared, the mall has decided to push Black Friday by one week!"
1886,17,8,Crowd,[turns and looks at him] What?
1887,17,8,Niles Lawson,"The genius idea was proposed by George R. R. Martin, who also suggested ""Fuck it, let's push Thanksgiving to December 3rd."" For pushing the date, the mall is now reducing Black Friday prices to 96% off to the first hundred people inside the mall! [the shoppers begin to fight each other] This is going to be a fucking bloodbath, Tom. There will be medical tents, ambulances, face-painting, no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die! [an elderly man holding up a 96% off flier lets out a dragon's roar]"
1888,17,9,Exec 1,"Taihen! Mada Microsoft watashi no fune tomatteiru. [""Bad news! Microsoft is still stopping our ships.""]"
1889,17,9,Sony President,"Sou ka... [""I see...""]"
1890,17,9,Exec 2,"Sugu, funukenakereba narimasen. Kono Buraku Furaide sugu kuru. [""We must not back down this soon. Black Friday will soon arrive.""]"
1891,17,9,Sony President,"Kore ga mondai desu ne? Ima Purincessu Kenni sugoi irimasu! [""This is a problem, right? I really need Princess Kenny now!""]"
1892,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"Tadaima! [""I'm back!""]"
1893,17,9,Sony President,Oh!
1894,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"Purincessu Kenni reporuto! [""Princess Kenny reporting!""]"
1895,17,9,Exec 1,"Ah! Ikimashita! [His eyes change to loving hearts icons--""Ah! He has arrived!""]"
1896,17,9,Exec 2,"Kawaii na, Purincessu Kenni. [""Princess Kenny is so cute.""]"
1897,17,9,Exec 1,"Un [""Yup.""]"
1898,17,9,Sony President,"Hayai de! Purincessu Kennu, arigato! Mondai dayo: XBokusu saisho no Bill Gates watashi no PS4 shipment tomatteimasu! [""That was quick. Thank you, Princess Kenny. We have a problem: XBox's president Bill Gates is stopping the shipment of the PS4!""]"
1899,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"Hai, Purincessu Kenni assisuto! [""Yessir! Princess Kenny will assist!""]"
1900,17,9,Captain,"Baka! Kora wa sugoi cheating desu! [""Idiot! This is amazing cheating!""]"
1901,17,9,Deckhand,"[points to the sky] Ara! Purincessu Kenni! [""Look! Princess Kenny!""]"
1902,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"Minna-san! Kenni kimasu! [""Everyone, Kenny has arrived""]"
1903,17,9,Deckhand,[elated] Aaaaah! [His eyes become loving stars]
1904,17,9,Eric Cartman,[nose in left hand] He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??
1905,17,9,Clyde Donovan,"Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony."
1906,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Because, because what? Because he's cute?"
1907,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!"
1908,17,9,Eric Cartman,But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
1909,17,9,Liane Cartman,"[appears in the sliding door] Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you."
1910,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom! [she turns around and goes back inside. Cartman reconsiders] Mom? [she looks back at him] Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. [she walks out of view]"
1911,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
1912,17,9,Eric Cartman,"He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!"
1913,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!"
1914,17,9,Eric Cartman,"So what are you saying, Kyle?!"
1915,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I have an idea. [turns around and walks off a bit] I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have."
1916,17,9,Niles Lawson,"Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here, and as you can see behind me, holiday shoppers are really getting antsy. People have been waiting out here since midnight on Thanksgiving. They're cold, they're starving, and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals. Joining me now is Rick Tellmore, [balding shopper] who's been out here for six days, and your five year old son was eaten. Is that correct?"
1917,17,9,Rick Tellmore,"Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one."
1918,17,9,Niles Lawson,What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start?
1919,17,9,Rick Tellmore,"A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks."
1920,17,9,Niles Lawson,"Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them?"
1921,17,9,Rick Tellmore,"[thinks a long time] 
Iiii...
ate my son for a Blu-ray play-er
With a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-le
My son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho! 
[as Niles speaks, he moves off, singing]
Ho ho jingle jing-le
Jingle jingle jang-le
Jingle jingle jingle ho ho!"
1922,17,9,Niles Lawson,"No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom."
1923,17,9,Stan Marsh,"Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here. [points to the location] Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. [points to a location outside cardboard Red Robin]"
1924,17,9,Craig Tucker,At Red Robin?
1925,17,9,Jimmy Valmer,That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
1926,17,9,Stan Marsh,The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
1927,17,9,Craig Tucker,So how do we take over Black Robin?
1928,17,9,Stan Marsh,I have no idea.
1929,17,9,Pete,"[appearing at the tent's entrance] Hey uh, excuse me?"
1930,17,9,Stan Marsh,Yes?
1931,17,9,Pete,"The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?"
1932,17,9,Stan Marsh,"What? [moments later, outside, Stan walks towards Cartman as the two armies face each other]"
1933,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Go ahead and tell him, Cartman."
1934,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?"
1935,17,9,Craig Tucker,Haha.
1936,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess."
1937,17,9,Clyde Donovan,Nobody saw that coming.
1938,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers."
1939,17,9,Stan Marsh,"So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. [turns around and walks away]"
1940,17,9,Eric Cartman,"We know a way inside the Red Robin. [this stops Stan, Jimmy and Craig] You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how."
1941,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there."
1942,17,9,Craig Tucker,"Hey, that could work."
1943,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's do this together, dude. [Stan turns around and goes back] Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too."
1944,17,9,Stan Marsh,And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
1945,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[pledges with his right hand up and puts his left hand behind his back] I swear, Stan."
1946,17,9,Stan Marsh,"[turns around] Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. [as he walks away with Jimmy and Craig, the camera reveals that Kyle had his fingers on the hand behind his back crossed during the swear.]"
1947,17,9,Sony President,"Taihen. Kono console warusu mada owaranai. [""This is bad! These console wars aren't over yet.""]"
1948,17,9,Exec 3,"Sou desu [""That's right""]"
1949,17,9,Sony President,"Un? [""Oh?""]"
1950,17,9,Exec 3,"[holds up a chart showing the projected sales of XBox and PS4 in Japan] XBox to Sony PS4 neku ando neku desu. [""The XBox and Sony PS4 are neck and neck.""]"
1951,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"Minna-san, ii yo. Purincessu Kenni ganbaru. [""Everyone, its alright. Princess Kenny will give it her all.""]"
1952,17,9,Secretary 1,"Kenni-chan, shitsure desu kedo. Wedding invitation kimashita. [""Kenny-chan, sorry to interrupt, but a wedding invitation has arrived.""]"
1953,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"Ha? Ueddingu? [""Huh? Wedding?"" Kenny reads the front of the invitation: ""You are invited to a wedding at Red Robin""]"
1954,17,9,Eric Cartman,"[Cartman's portrait, anime-style with a beard, voices over as Kenny reads the note inside the invitation.] Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King."
1955,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"Waaah? Sugoi-chan. [""What? Sweet!""]"
1956,17,9,Exec 1,"Purincessu Kenni ueddingu irimasu ne? [""Princess Kenny is going to be in a wedding, right?""]"
1957,17,9,Exec 2,"Un. [""Yeah.""]"
1958,17,9,Sony President,"Purincessu Kenni, honto ni zenbu arigato [""Princess Kenny, thanks so much for everything.""]"
1959,17,9,Exec 1,"Ki o tsukete, Kenni-chan [""Take care, Kenny-chan!""]"
1960,17,9,Exec 2,"Purincessu Kenni, sayonara! [""Goodbye, Princess Kenny!"" They all bow]"
1961,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"Minna-san, sayonara! Ima, Purincessu Kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu! [""Goodbye, everyone! Princess Kenny is going back home to her friends!"" Kenny jumps out the window... and drops straight down. She crashes into the street below and leaves a big puddle of blood]"
1962,17,9,Man on Street,Eh?!
1963,17,9,Exec 1,"Nande koto! Purincessu Kenni koroshita! [""Oh my God! It killed Princess Kenny!""]"
1964,17,9,Exec 2,"Honto! Purincessu Kenni shindeitta! [""It's true! Princess Kenny is dead!""]"
1965,17,9,Exec 1,"Horaa! [""Look!""]"
1966,17,9,Kenny McCormick,"[gets up and dusts himself off, then floats in the air] Purincessu Kenni daijobu dayo! [""Princess Kenny is fine!""]"
1967,17,9,The Office,"Ahh, kawaii! [The men's eyes turn to hearts, the women's to happy upside-down U's--""Ahh, how cute!""]"
1968,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding."
1969,17,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, sure, what about it?"
1970,17,9,Eric Cartman,"I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. [reaches out for a yellow rose]"
1971,17,9,Stan Marsh,Why?
1972,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Well, think about it. [hands the rose to Stan, who takes it] The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by."
1973,17,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s."
1974,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-"
1975,17,9,Homeowner,"He's lying to you! [Cartman gets annoyed, and he and Stan look at the homeowner] They're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff!"
1976,17,9,Eric Cartman,Dude! Dude!
1977,17,9,Homeowner,They're gonna betray you at the Red Robin wedding! He got the idea watching Game of Thrones!
1978,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, shut the fuck up!"
1979,17,9,Stan Marsh,Who is that?
1980,17,9,Eric Cartman,He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
1981,17,9,Homeowner,They're gonna lock you in!
1982,17,9,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, shut up!"
1983,17,9,Homeowner,He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!
1984,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!"
1985,17,9,Stan Marsh,Did Kyle know about this?
1986,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about."
1987,17,9,Stan Marsh,Did Kyle know about this?!
1988,17,9,Eric Cartman,"[sighs] Kyle thought of it. [Stan bolts out of there] Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude! [with Stan not returning, Cartman looks at the homeowner] You're a fuckin' asshole!"
1989,17,9,Homeowner,"Fuck you, get out of my garden!"
1990,17,9,Eric Cartman,I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
1991,17,9,Homeowner,Go fuck yourself! [slams his bedroom window shut]
1992,17,9,Tammy Thompson,"Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here."
1993,17,9,Tom Thompson,"Niles Lawson is at the scene, and it's about time, Niles."
1994,17,9,Niles Lawson,"That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon. [shown] This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. R. Martin, who um, doesn't appear to have shown up yet, [a real-life photo of GRRM is shown] but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way."
1995,17,9,Butters Stotch,Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
1996,17,9,GRRM,"That may be true, but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation."
1997,17,9,Butters Stotch,"What's that? [looks around, than below, his horse] Awww! [horse is shown with a huge semi-hard penis.]"
1998,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?"
1999,17,9,Red Robin Manager,"Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?"
2000,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé."
2001,17,9,Red Robin Manager,"It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!"
2002,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Yesh, kewl."
2003,17,9,Red Robin Manager,So Beyoncé is not with Jay-Z anymore?
2004,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was."
2005,17,9,Red Robin Manager,"Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?"
2006,17,9,Eric Cartman,Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
2007,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[rushes up] Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!"
2008,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Yes, he did."
2009,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
2010,17,9,Eric Cartman,"[shushes Kyle up and walks him a few steps] It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again."
2011,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,[getting alarmed] What the hell did you do??
2012,17,9,Eric Cartman,"What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!"
2013,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,No. Tell me you didn't!
2014,17,9,Sharon Marsh,"He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door."
2015,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks, Mrs. Marsh."
2016,17,9,Sharon Marsh,And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
2017,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ok-okay. [watches her leave, walks over to Stan's door and knocks] Stan? Stan?"
2018,17,9,Stan Marsh,"[startled out of his sleep] Huh? Hello? Who is that? [next to him is a glass of milk, a sandwich with a bite in it, and a tin cup]"
2019,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, it's me."
2020,17,9,Stan Marsh,Get out of here!
2021,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us."
2022,17,9,Stan Marsh,You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
2023,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair."
2024,17,9,Stan Marsh,"[stands and turns to address Kyle] I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!"
2025,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,You didn't?
2026,17,9,Stan Marsh,...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
2027,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine."
2028,17,9,Stan Marsh,You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
2029,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[lets his head fall on the door] Stan, don't say that."
2030,17,9,Stan Marsh,"Get out of here! I'm done with you! [grabs the tin cup and raps it against his bedroom 'jail cell' door as in classic prison movies] Mom! Mom! [Kyle stands up straight] Get him out of here! [Sharon arrives, and Kyle back away from the door] Get him out! [Kyle leaves]"
2031,17,9,Randy Marsh,"Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die! [points to the main entrance] When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk! [a blond guard begins to weep] Stay tough, rookie."
2032,17,9,Guard 6,"We're not gonna make it, sir."
2033,17,9,Randy Marsh,"We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!"
2034,17,9,Guard 6,Okay.
2035,17,9,Randy Marsh,OKAY?!
2036,17,9,Guard 6,Yes sir! Yes sir.
2037,17,9,Randy Marsh,"Not one more good person dies on my watch! [all of a sudden, shoppers break through the skylight on the upper level]"
2038,17,9,Guard 3,Oh my God!
2039,17,9,Guard 8,They're comin' in through the roof!
2040,17,9,Guard 6,"[begins to back away] I can't do this! I'm sorry! I can't do this! [runs off, and now there are seven]"
2041,17,9,Randy Marsh,"Stay at your post! [an arrow pierces the fleeing guard's back right chest. Randy is shown again, holding the bow from which the arrow came] Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!"
2042,17,9,Niles Lawson,"Here we go, Tom. George R. R. Martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon. [GRRM is shown behind the red ribbon with scissors in hand]"
2043,17,9,GRRM,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to be here this morning on behalf of South Park Mall Partners and channel 9 News, your go-to source for news, weather, and sports."
2044,17,9,Shopper 8,"Just do it! [the shoppers in front crouch down, ready to run inside]"
2045,17,9,GRRM,"Very well. In the tradition of our ancestors, [lowers the scissors to a cutting position] let's bring in the holidays! [more jockeying for position. GRRM pulls up at the last moment and closes the scissors] But first, I'd like to share with you a few words about my wiener."
2046,17,9,Crowd,"AAAWWWW!! [off to one side, where the crowd can't see, the Goth kids approach Red Robin]"
2047,17,9,Red Robin Manager,"Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today."
2048,17,9,Pete,"Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding."
2049,17,9,Red Robin Manager,"Oh great, go right on in. [smiles and lets them in]"
2050,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s. [all cheer] And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs. [Kenny mumbles back] Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit. [leaves the table and goes to the mall-side entrance, where Clyde is keeping watch] What have you found out?"
2051,17,9,Clyde Donovan,The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
2052,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh okay, that could be a while. [turns away from the door] All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit."
2053,17,9,GRRM,O soft and pink with purple head.Gently you lay with me on my bed.
2054,17,9,Shopper 9,"Get on with it, George R. R. Martin! [the rest of the crowd rallies behind him]"
2055,17,9,GRRM,"""Growl, growl"" calls the wiener from on high
A little tiny wiener, still so pleasing to the eye."
2056,17,9,Shopper 1,Enough with the wieners already!
2057,17,9,Shopper 11,"Yeah, come on!"
2058,17,9,Eric Cartman,Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
2059,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Cartman and Kenny's table] Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! [the PS4 soldiers immediately brandish their weapons and aim them at the XBox soldiers. Tweek advances on Token with an armed bow. Kenny has his sword under Cartman's chin]"
2060,17,9,Eric Cartman,What the hell is this?!
2061,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!"
2062,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!"
2063,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!"
2064,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!"
2065,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,"The fight is over, Cartman!"
2066,17,9,Bill Gates,[walks into view] It's not over. Looks like I came just in time.
2067,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!"
2068,17,9,Sony President,"[walks into view and speaks in very thick accent] You will not interfere, Bill Gates! These-a children will get their PS4s! [Kenny exults]"
2069,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
2070,17,9,Eric Cartman,They're not a part of your betrayal?
2071,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
2072,17,9,Eric Cartman,"No. Whose betrayal is this? [the sound of chains comes from the mall entrance - Stan locks the doors, then turns around]"
2073,17,9,Stan Marsh,We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
2074,17,9,Kyle Broflovski,Stan?
2075,17,9,Guard 3,"Sir? Sir, Operations just said they need one of us to unlock the door to Red Robin to let some wedding party inside the mall!"
2076,17,9,Randy Marsh,Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
2077,17,9,Guard 3,Tom Hanks and Beyoncé.
2078,17,9,Randy Marsh,"What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé! [runs towards Red Robin] I've gotta save them!"
2079,17,9,Stan Marsh,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block. [stops between the two presidents] Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad? [throws his sword at the Sony president] Then you fucking fight!"
2080,17,9,Sony President,"Huh? [strokes the wooden sword] Sou...[""I see...""]"
2081,17,9,Bill Gates,Then let's finish it! [begins to unbutton his shirt] You and me!
2082,17,9,Sony President,"Ikimashou! [""Let's go!""]"
2083,17,9,Bill Gates,"[now topless, he is fully covered in MS-13 gang tattoos. Prominent chest tattoo is ""MS-DOS""] Winner take all!"
2084,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh dude, this is pretty sweet."
2085,17,9,Sony President,"Then let this be your last fight, Bill Gates. [Gates throws the first punch, then follows up with a few kicks. The Sony president comes back with a right hook. The kids look on in horror as the men fight unarmed. Butters finally shows up.]"
2086,17,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey, fellas. What did I miss? [smiles]"
2087,17,9,GRRM,Look at this wiener. [unzips his pants] Judge it by its size?Rub it three times and it has a surprise. [Shopper 4 joins GRRM after GRRM exposes his penis and opens up a switchblade]
2088,17,9,Shopper 4,"That's it! You're not delaying this anymore, you wiener-loving bitch! [slices off GRRM's penis and throws it into the crowd, which cheers wildly. Shopper 4 cuts the ribbon, and the crowd surges into the mall. The six remaining guards are powerless against the crowd]"

2099,17,9,Stan Marsh,[flatly] Yay.

2107,17,9,Niles Lawson,"Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News."
2108,17,9,Eric Cartman,"The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface."
2109,17,9,Stan Marsh,"Yes, it is."

2114,17,9,Eric Cartman,I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
2115,17,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?"
2116,17,9,Eric Cartman,"The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?"
2117,17,9,The Boys,"Yeah, you're right. You make a point."
2118,17,9,Eric Cartman,"Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this. [grabs a stick from the ground] We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!"
2119,17,9,The Boys,Yeah!

2134,17,10,Nichole Daniels,Ugh.
2135,17,10,Bebe Stevens,Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
2136,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?"
2137,17,10,Lisa Berger,But I'm the fat one.
2138,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,What?
2139,17,10,Lisa Berger,Every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me.
2140,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?"
2141,17,10,Heidi Turner,There's only one boy that Lisa cares about.
2142,17,10,Red,"Yeah, Lisa has a crush on Butters."
2143,17,10,Lisa Berger,Shut up!
2144,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?"
2145,17,10,Lisa Berger,No way. I I'd just get made fun of.
2146,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!"
2147,17,10,,"[The cafeteria, later. Kenny, Cartman, Tweek, Craig, Clyde, and Butters are seated at table, with Butters recounting something]"
2148,17,10,Butters Stotch,"So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says ""I""-"
2149,17,10,Lisa Berger,"Uh, excuse me. Butters?"
2150,17,10,Butters Stotch,"[confused for a moment, then looks over his left shoulder] Oh. Yes?"
2151,17,10,Lisa Berger,"Um, well, I was just wondering if... [strokes her hair] maybe... [brings her arm down] you would like to go to a movie this weekend."
2152,17,10,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me."
2153,17,10,Lisa Berger,"[casts her eyes down] Okay, thanks."
2154,17,10,Butters Stotch,"See ya, Lisa! [Esther overhears the conversation from the next table and looks over her shoulder at Butters]"
2155,17,10,Craig Tucker,"Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl."
2156,17,10,Clyde Donovan,"At least she didn't try to sit on him. [the other boys at the table laugh, except Cartman]"
2157,17,10,Eric Cartman,"You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?"
2158,17,10,,"[The hallway, later. Butters is at his locker]"
2159,17,10,Butters Stotch,"Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
[Wendy comes to view at the end of the hall and spots him, then walks up to him]

Oh-"
2160,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,[grabs his locker door and slams it shut] What the fuck is your problem?!
2161,17,10,Butters Stotch,Oh. Hey Wendy.
2162,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
2163,17,10,Butters Stotch,Am I just an asshole?
2164,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah!
2165,17,10,Butters Stotch,"Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything."
2166,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
2167,17,10,Butters Stotch,Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
2168,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!"
2169,17,10,Butters Stotch,Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
2170,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,What?!
2171,17,10,Butters Stotch,"I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women. [opens his locker again. On the door are several pinup posters of Kim Kardashian] I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect everything."
2172,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"[grabs the poster] This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!"
2173,17,10,Butters Stotch,You're a liar!
2174,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Look it up, stupid! [crushes the poster into a wad] In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit! [throws the wadded-up poster to the floor and walks away. As Butters reaches for the poster, Wendy turns around] You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! [turns around and goes around the corner. Butters unwads the poster]"
2175,17,10,,"[Mr. Mackey's office, later. Butters is in there with Mr. Mackey, crying. Wendy walks in a few seconds later]"
2176,17,10,Mr Mackey,"Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it."
2177,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,[noticing Butters] Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
2178,17,10,Mr Mackey,"Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit."
2179,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,...Are you serious?
2180,17,10,Butters Stotch,"You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!"
2181,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian!
2182,17,10,Mr Mackey,"Uh but, but Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay?"
2183,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit."
2184,17,10,Butters Stotch,"Oh, she said it again!"
2185,17,10,Mr Mackey,"Now, Wendy, Kim might be uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, mkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel?"
2186,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"I'm not ""jel"", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!"
2187,17,10,Mr Mackey,"Uh that may be true, but there is a very fine line, Wendy, between being a feminist and being a hater, mkay? And you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly!"
2188,17,10,,"[Room 7, later. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison stands before the class]"
2189,17,10,Mr Garrison,"Okay kids, there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school, and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker. Here to explain why Kim Kardashian is not a hobbit, please welcome, Aquaman. [goes to his desk as Kanye West enters the room. The class claps]"
2190,17,10,Kanye West,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh, that's right"
2191,17,10,Eric Cartman,[recognizing him] Uh oh.
2192,17,10,Kanye West,"[enunciating] Okay, first of all, I am NOT Aquaman, I am a recovering... gay fish. Yes, I have met Aquaman. I have hung out with Aquaman. But the only thing I have in common with Aquaman anymore is my love for the sea. [adjusting his pants] Now! [clears his throat] There have been malicious rumors, started at this elementary school, that my beautiful fiancée is a hobbit. That is not funny, and it is not true. [Wendy's eyes are glazing over] Alright?! Yes, Kim is heavier than most of her pictures show her to be. Yes, she gets her hair lasered off her body. Yes, she has a friend named Gandalf who happens to be a wizard. [finds himself trapped by that last statement, and backs up] I'm sorry, excuse me a minute. [calls Kim up and turns his back on the class...] Bitch, how are you not a hobbit again? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah right. Right right right right right, yeah. Okay. Yep. Yep. Let me get- okay. Yep, I got it. Okay, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and turns to the class.] Okay, if my fiancée Kim… is… a hobbit, then how come… it uh how c- then, okay, if she's a hobbit, then how come she don't live in a hole in the ground? BOOOOOOM! All y'all just got lit up, cuz! She don't live in no hole in the ground, she lives in a big-ass mansion, with me, in her room, that is slightly below ground! So, you can… She, she is sexy, and womanly, and she smokes a pipe. She can blow them rings that go up over her head, and… Hold up.[calls Kim up again and turns his back on the class...] Bitch, you not a hobbit, right? ... No, I know, you just, you smoke that long pipe sometimes when you sit by the fire... Oh it's a- Oh, okay. Got it, got it- What do you call it? Yep. Yep, got it. Okay. Yep, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and turns to the class.] That is not a hobbit pipe, for your information! It is a personal oral humidifier to keep all the wrinkles around her mouth from showin'. So haha, all you haters, HA!"
2193,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Butters. Butters, come here for a sec."
2194,17,10,Butters Stotch,"Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!"
2195,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?"
2196,17,10,Butters Stotch,"Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! [she goes back inside, and Butters follows her in]"
2197,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?"
2198,17,10,Butters Stotch,Okay.
2199,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides [she trims them down a bit]. We select the eyes [makes the glasses more rectangular and shorter, and adds eye makeup], make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin [the freckles go], lengthen the neck [moves the head up], add more to the hair [gives Lisa longer, wavy hair], select the lips and make them fuller [removes the harelip], take out any puffiness on the skin [reduces the cheeks] here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin [this gives Lisa hips], streamline the shoulders [making the arms thinner in the process], put highlights in the eyes [gives her a nose], and, there."
2200,17,10,Butters Stotch,That's Lisa Berger?
2201,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Do you see what I'm talking about?
2202,17,10,Butters Stotch,She's pretty!
2203,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
2204,17,10,Butters Stotch,Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
2205,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,What? What do you mean?
2206,17,10,Butters Stotch,"And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this [sends it off] and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. [runs out of the lab]"

2210,17,10,Eric Cartman,I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
2211,17,10,Butters Stotch,"II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever."
2212,17,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde."
2213,17,10,Butters Stotch,What?! Well since when?
2214,17,10,Eric Cartman,"Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. [next shot is of Clyde walking down the hall with Lisa on his arm as he looks at his phone's screen. Everyone turns and stares at the new couple. They stop at Token at his locker]"

2224,17,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics. [Wendy walks up to them, mad] She got really hot all of a sudden."
2225,17,10,Jimmy Valmer,Yeah. I wouldn't mind t-tah-t-tappin' that ass.
2226,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Excuse me!

2228,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Why would I be jel?
2229,17,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy."
2230,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
2231,17,10,Stan Marsh,She looks pretty hot here.
2232,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! [just then, Lisa and Clyde walk past her, but she doesn't see this. Jimmy does, though.]"
2233,17,10,Clyde Donovan,"That's not very nice, Wendy."
2234,17,10,Lisa Berger,"What's your problem, Wendy?"
2235,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"[looks and quickly assesses the situation] I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa."
2236,17,10,Lisa Berger,You're just a hater. Why don't you mind your own business instead of being jelly?
2237,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!"
2238,17,10,Clyde Donovan,"It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. [walks off with Lisa]"

2243,17,10,Mr Mackey,"No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!"
2244,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Jelly school?
2245,17,10,Mr Mackey,"That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?! [picks up the receiver and starts pressing keys on the keypad] I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it![puts the receiver up to his ear] Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!"
2246,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make."
2247,17,10,Mr Mackey,"Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay?"
2248,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes."
2249,17,10,Mr Mackey,"Okay, well Wendy, I'm just tryin' to uh- Oh, bye, jelly school. [hangs up the phone] Uh, Wendy, I'm just tryin' to make you understand how serious it is when you lash out at other girls."

2269,17,10,,"[South Park Elementary Gym, after the game. Wendy is upset that she got no cheers from the audience]"
2270,17,10,Red,"Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore."
2271,17,10,Bebe Stevens,All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
2272,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!"
2273,17,10,Heidi Turner,Why?! Don't you care about us?!
2274,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! [turns left and walks away]"
2275,17,10,Lisa Berger,"[to the cheerleaders' left] Hey girls. [dressed in a hot outfit] Don't be sad. If you wanna look really hot, like me, you just gotta be willing to sweat. Get down to the gym and work!"
2276,17,10,,"[Total-Self Image, day, inside. The cheerleaders await instructions from a coach]"
2277,17,10,Coach,"Alright girls, we're gonna trim that fat and tone those bodies. Let's do this! You first! [points to Bebe] Get right up there! [gets on a treadmill. The coach quickly moves around the treadmill and begins taking pictures] Alright, now look here. [Bebe quickly figures out what she needs to do and begins posing. Later on...] Come on, burn it off! You got this! [Bebe is shown editing the pictures the coach just took. She puts blush on her cheeks, lipstick on her lips, blonde eyebrows on her eyes, a fuller body of hair... Next, Red edits her picture. She puts on a cute, tiny smile and eye makeup. Annie removes the fat around her torso and augments her breasts, Heidi gives herself a new hairstyle, Nichole gets more tone and a shorter neck, tighter cheeks, straighter hair, eyebrows, a lighter shade of brown, eye makeup, lipstick, a more level head, fuller lips, breasts. Next is Lisa performing in a video, a parody of ""Work Bitch"". Next is a shot of the girls looking at their Photoshopped selves.]"
2278,17,10,Coach,"[to Lola] Look at those thighs! Come on, you've gotta push harder! [Lola removes some fat from her midsection and gives herself a bow on her shirt, then straightens out her head. Even Timmy, who isn't a cheerleader, gets the Photoshop treatment. His wheelchair is removed, he's given proper, working legs, his shirt is lengthened and given a collar, he's given more hair and his eyes are made to look forward, his mouth is fixed and he's given a coat. Red drinks from a water bottle while Lola is sweating from the hard work. All the while, Lisa raps]'"
2279,17,10,Lisa Berger,"You wanna?
You, you, you wanna?
You wanna?
You wanna look pretty?
You want a boyfriend?
You want a nice ass?
You better work out, slut!
You want nice things?
You want boys to give you nice things?
You better work out, slut!

2283,17,10,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, look at Bebe! [her picture is shown] I had no idea Bebe was that hot."
2284,17,10,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, but did you see Token's girlfriend? [flips through the pictures until he gets to Nichole]"
2285,17,10,The Boys,Wooowww!
2286,17,10,Clyde Donovan,"Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys."
2287,17,10,Butters Stotch,No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! [Craig flips back to her]
2288,17,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
2289,17,10,Eric Cartman,"Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons."
2290,17,10,Butters Stotch,"I do love water balloons. [the boys fall silent and continue viewing the pictures. Stan gets sad and leaves; viewing all those pictures, not one of them of Wendy, disheartened him]"

2292,17,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?"
2293,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,[curt] What?
2294,17,10,Stan Marsh,"A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are."
2295,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!"
2296,17,10,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, why is it such a big deal?"
2297,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
2298,17,10,Stan Marsh,[looks down] I do? [kids begin to walk by]
2299,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah. [begins to point out other kids' defects] And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders. [The cheerleaders come into view and approach Wendy and Stan. Neither of them notices] The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nichole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair. [Mr. Mackey walks in on the rant] And Heidi Turner's butt is flat! [Wendy turns to leave, but runs into the cheerleaders and Mr. Mackey] Oh God damn it!"
2300,17,10,Bebe Stevens,[furious] You! HATER!

One thing I know, my girl ain't no hobbit.
She might be stumpy; that don't mean she a hobbit.
She's not a hobbit 'cause she couldn't be.
She got no Bagginses in her family tree.
Yes on occasion she hangs out with her dwarf friends.
But she never went on no quest with her dwarf friends.
Except for one time she went to kill that dragon.
She took his gold and she- [he stops the video shoot]

Hang on a minute, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [calls up Kim yet again] Bitch, remember when you went off to kill that dragon with them dwarves? ... Yeah. Oh yeah. Rightrightrightright, yup. Yup, I got it. Yep, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and resumes the shoot.]

It wasn't no dragon, so my girl ain't no hobbit.
That was a Quizno's and my bitch went to rob it.
'Cause they got that ham that she robs on her cellulite.
While she drinking her grog and singin' those merry songs... at night...
My girl ain't no hobbit.
Please God, tell me I'm not engaged to no hobbit.

2337,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
2338,17,10,Tom and Tammy Thompson,And you're not just... being a hater.
2339,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,...Nooo.
2340,17,10,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"'Cause sometimes, girls who aren't well-liked, you know, lash out at pretty and popular girls. Are, are you well-liked at your school?"

2342,17,10,Tom and Tammy Thompson,Uh huh. But you're not being jelly?
2343,17,10,Wendy Testaburger,NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
2344,17,10,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Okay, because I do understand that the jelly school in Aurora is ready to take you in. Is that right, Rick?"
2345,17,10,Rick,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-"

And all the hobbit ever wanted was to be beautiful. And even though she was short and fat and hairy, this little hobbit dreamed that one day she could be pretty like Beyoncé. [clears his throat] And then one day, along came a magic power, called Photoshop. And just like that, poof, the little hobbit was beautiful. And even though she still couldn't sing like Beyoncé, or dance like Beyoncé, or act like Beyoncé, or be a decent human being like Beyoncé, the little hobbit was looked up to and loved, just like Beyoncé! [takes a tissue from Wendy's tissue box and wipes away his tears with it] Soon she had money, and adoration, and a hip-hop fiancée who loved her very much- [turns away, getting choked up] I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up, I'm sorry. [returns to reading] Everything was good for the hobbit. But then this mean little girl, called the Jelly Monster, she was sooo jelly of the hobbit that she told everyone she was a liar, and the hobbit's fiancée realized she was just a hobbit. And you know what he said? He said ""I don't CARE!"" And then the jelly monster came and tried to take the magic power away from the little hobbit, so the hobbit prayed to God, and God said ""Don't worry, little hobbit. I will go find this jelly monster girl, and I will read her a story and melt her icy heart."" And the hobbit said ""Thank you,"" and the hobbit and God lived happily ever after in the shower forever 'cause I love her so much! [breaks down and cries] I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. I'm sorry."

She now has hips, breasts, lipstick, blush, eyebrows and eyelashes. She's done, and clicks the Send button, which brings up a confirmation box which asks ""Mass Email File 'My Pic'?"". She moves the cursor to ""Yes"". The mouse doesn't move after that, and she clicks on ""Yes"". She wipes away her tears, pushes herself away from the computer, and leaves the computer lab.]"
