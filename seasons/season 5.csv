0,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,[joining the two other boys] Hey you guys! Look what I have!
1,5,1,Stan Marsh,What?
2,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
3,5,1,Stan and Kenny,[pause] ...Oh.
4,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool."
5,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool."
6,5,1,Eric Cartman,"[off-screen, but rushes in] You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!"
7,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"What, doughboy?"
8,5,1,Eric Cartman,"I was just- [looks stung, then flashes an angry look at Kyle] I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial."
9,5,1,Stan Marsh,So?
10,5,1,Eric Cartman,"So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama."
11,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?
12,5,1,Eric Cartman,"No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television."
13,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
14,5,1,Eric Cartman,You'll never guess.
15,5,1,Stan Marsh,What?!
16,5,1,Eric Cartman,Guess.
17,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?"
18,5,1,Eric Cartman,"You ready? [focus on Cartman] Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say, [looks both ways] ""Shit."""
19,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[gasps] They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?"
20,5,1,Stan Marsh,"They can't say ""shit"" on television!"
21,5,1,Eric Cartman,"It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude."
22,5,1,Stan Marsh,Holy fucking shit!
23,5,1,Kenny McCormick,(Dude! We've gotta watch!)
24,5,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
25,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
26,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!"
27,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
28,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come, on dude! This is history."
29,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,It's stupid!
30,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?"
31,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!"
32,5,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?"
33,5,1,Sam,"Yeah, they're gonna say ""shit"" on television."
34,5,1,Colleague 1,"[balding man] Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar."
35,5,1,Colleague 2,[with light brown hair] Yeaaahhh!
36,5,1,Sam,Yeah.
37,5,1,Randy Marsh,Yeah.
38,5,1,Colleague 2,Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
39,5,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show."
40,5,1,Sam,"And they're gonna say ""shit""!"
41,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Butters! [Butters turns to see Kyle, and the tag is shown: ""Butters""] I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite [points] YOU before anybody else."
42,5,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, sorry, I can't. [Kyle is disappointed] They're gonna say ""shit"" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way."
43,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
44,5,1,Mr Garrison,"[walks by] Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes! [people get in their cars and peel out of there, while those on the sidewalks quickly disperse. Only Kyle is left, bewildered]"
45,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","[voice-over] Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse me!"
46,5,1,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes."
47,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!"
48,5,1,Jimbo,"Oh, was that it? Was that it?!"
49,5,1,Randy Marsh,"[annoyed] Shipped. He said ""shipped""."
50,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -"
51,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",- your job is to protect the men who serve this force.
52,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!"
53,5,1,Stan Marsh,Sh!
54,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
55,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!
56,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!"
57,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.
58,5,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?"
59,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","That's it, I've had enough of this."
60,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","Don't you turn your back on me, you!"
61,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","I said, enough!"
62,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Is it?
63,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Will it... ever be enough?
64,5,1,Announcer,Cop Drama will return after these messages.
65,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?"""
66,5,1,Eric Cartman,I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
67,5,1,Stan and Kyle,Uh! [Kyle drops from the sofa and heads away]
68,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Where are you going, Kyle?"
69,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,[stops and looks back] I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
70,5,1,Stan Marsh,"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!"
71,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,I don't really give a fuck! [turns and walks away]
72,5,1,Stan Marsh,Oh.
73,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
74,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what."
75,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama",You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
76,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell? [voice lowers to a whisper] You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there."
77,5,1,"Frank and Mitchell (voices only), two cops on Cop Drama","Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks."
78,5,1,Bar Patrons,Wow!!!
79,5,1,The Boys,Whoa!!!
80,5,1,Chef and Principal Victoria,Oh!!
81,5,1,Old Folks,Whoa!
82,5,1,Jimbo,[awed] They did it!
83,5,1,Stan Marsh,I can't believe they actually said it. [Kyle returns with some food]
84,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!"
85,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
86,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?"
87,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?! [moves from one end of the sofa to the other] Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world? [moves towards the front door] It's still the same old world out there. Look. [opens the door to find frogs raining down on the neighborhood. The other boys soon join him] What the hell?"
88,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs."
89,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, whatever. [steps back inside]"
90,5,1,Anchor Tom,"Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama [title screen pops up], broke new ground by saying ""Shit!"" on television, making ""shit"" officially okay to say around the country. [poll picture pops up, and is filled in as the announcer continues] A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit. [A Medical Alert pops up] In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community. [a field reporter stands before an ambulance and a barn] Rick Watts has the story."
91,5,1,Rick Watts and Anchorman Tom,"Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town- [begins to vomit strenuously, then falls over dead]"
92,5,1,Rick Watts and Anchorman Tom,"Whoa, shit!"
93,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, ""shit""."
94,5,1,Stan Marsh,"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?!"
95,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
96,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form."
97,5,1,Eric Cartman,[quizzically] Huh?
98,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance, [turns and writes on the board] ""That's a shitty picture of me."" is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of [writes] ""This is a picture of shit."" is still naughty. [crosses out the sentence]"
99,5,1,Eric Cartman,I don't get it.
100,5,1,Stan Marsh,Me neither.
101,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example: [writes] ""The weather outside is shitty."" However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example: [writes] ""My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty."" [crosses it out] That's right out!"
102,5,1,Timmy Burch,Sss...sss...[draws it out] shit. [grins]
103,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"Very good, Timmy."
104,5,1,Butters Stotch,"[raises his hand] Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, ""Oh, shit,"" or, ""shit on a shingle""?"
105,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"Yes, that's now fine."
106,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!"
107,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[angrily] It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!"
108,5,1,Eric Cartman,"Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina."
109,5,1,Kyle Broflovski,There's no sand in my vagina!!!
110,5,1,Ms Choksondik,"[pointing] Boys, watch your language! Shit!"
111,5,1,Mr Garrison,"And so, children, instead of saying ""Hand in your papers,"" I may now say, ""Hand in your shit."" Any questions?"
112,5,1,Filmore,"What about, ""I have to take a shit""?"
113,5,1,Mr Garrison,"No! No, Filmore! You can say ""I have to poop and shit,"" or ""Oh, shit, I have to poop,"" but not ""I have to shit."" Are we all clear?"
114,5,1,Kindergartners,No.
115,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts."
116,5,2,Stan Marsh,"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know."
117,5,2,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
118,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"Well, now, that's part of the fun."
119,5,2,Randy Marsh,Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
120,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. [all but Cartman laugh]"
121,5,2,Eric Cartman,That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
122,5,2,Stan Marsh,"[calling to the back] Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??"
123,5,2,Timmy Burch,Hyeah Timmay!
124,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, he's excited."
125,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Hey, fellas!"
126,5,2,Eric Cartman,"[flatly] Hey, Butters."
127,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody."
128,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine."
129,5,2,Stuart McCormick,You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
130,5,2,Big Gay Al,[suddenly steps in] Hello scouts!
131,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey, it's Big Gay Al!"
132,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!"
133,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
134,5,2,Randy Marsh,You're the new scout leader?
135,5,2,Big Gay Al,"[walks around the boys and stops behind the dads, hugging them] I just got transferred in. [lets go of the dads and moves further into the room] I think everyone's here now, so we can get started. [stops] Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do! [moves again]"
136,5,2,Boys,"Hooray! [they start moving, too]"
137,5,2,Stan Marsh,"See ya, Dad!"
138,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses. [Randy and Stuart look on a bit longer, then turn around and walk out. Close-up on the table reveals four older scouts, two on either side of Big Gay Al] Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!"
139,5,2,Timmy Burch,[happily] Timmay!
140,5,2,Big Gay Al,So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy! [points to his right. Jimmy walks up using his crutches.]
141,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Well hello everyone. [applause]
142,5,2,Timmy Burch,Ji- Jimmay?
143,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!"
144,5,2,Randy Marsh,He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
145,5,2,Stephen,Well how gay is he?
146,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"He's really, really gay."
147,5,2,Token s father,"Well then, I don't want my boy there, either. [more argument ensues]"
148,5,2,Randy Marsh,So he's a homosexual. So what?
149,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??"
150,5,2,Skeeter,"You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. [more argument]"
151,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Aw, that's ridiculous."
152,5,2,Priest Maxi,"[walks in] People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back."
153,5,2,Man,"[voice only] That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!"
154,5,2,Man 2,[voice only] That's right.
155,5,2,Man 3,[voice only] You did.
156,5,2,Big Gay Al,"And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy. [Jimmy walks into view] Let's give him a big hand. [applause]"
157,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a great audience. [applause dies down] Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B. [the other kids laugh] You guys like im- personations? [applause]"
158,5,2,Timmy Burch,[displeased] Timmy.
159,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"How about Jimmy Stewart? ""Merry Christmas, movie house."" And John Travolta. ""Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"""
160,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Jimmy's funny, dude."
161,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!"
162,5,2,Timmy Burch,[gets angry and crosses his arms] Hmph! [the doors open and in walk Randy and Stuart]
163,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock."
164,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stanley."
165,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck."
166,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?"
167,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey, yeah!"
168,5,2,Timmy Burch,[brushing off the idea] Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy. [camera pulls back to show Jimmy walking up]
169,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?"
170,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas."
171,5,2,Randy Marsh,"[the other scouts leave] Come on, Stan."
172,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time."
173,5,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, see ya.)"
174,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Bye, Jimmy."
175,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Bye, Jimmy."
176,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas."
177,5,2,Stan Marsh,"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!"
178,5,2,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
179,5,2,Stan Marsh,"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!"
180,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale."
181,5,2,Stan Marsh,"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!"
182,5,2,Timmy Burch,"[outside, visibly upset] Yahahah!!!"
183,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale."
184,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose. [Randy bears down on the brakes, causing Timmy to roll backwards and into the back window]"
185,5,2,Timmy Burch,Ah.
186,5,2,Randy Marsh,[to Stan] What did you say?!
187,5,2,Stan Marsh,"[a bit softly, eyes fixed on his fater] I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose."
188,5,2,Stuart McCormick,Uh huh!
189,5,2,Randy Marsh,"You do not say ""Big silly goose""! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!"
190,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-"
191,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!"
192,5,2,Stan Marsh,[glances at Cartman] ...Asshole. [looks at Randy again]
193,5,2,Randy Marsh,That's better.
194,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch."
195,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! [Jimmy walks up on crutches to the mic and begins]"
196,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired! [male laughter] What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush."" [laughter]"
197,5,2,Sharon Marsh,[heartfelt] What a brave little boy.
198,5,2,Sheila Broflovski,"He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! [Timmy, upset, sighs and crosses his arms]"
199,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park. [more people gather] H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? ""Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!"" [more laughter]"
200,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Hehe, I don't sound like that."
201,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"And how about that school counselor? ""Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad."" [Mackey happily nudges a man to his right] ""Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?"" [Timmy is stewing in his anger] Wow, what a great audience. ""Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-"" [Garrison grins] ""Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat"" [more laughter] ""I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch."" [Chef looks flattered] ""Salisbury steak for lunch."" Eh. Uh. ""Goddamnit, Goddamnit!"" [more, stronger laughter and applause] And of course, my very favorite, ""Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!"" [the laughter and applause get louder, and Timmy gets livid] ""Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy."" Heh. Sometimes it's like, ""Please, Timmy, learn a new word,"" heh. ""Timmy! Tu-Timmy!"" [more laughter]"
202,5,2,Timmy Burch,"[angrily] Aaaaaaah! [Stan notices. Quickly, Timmy takes a cake half and throws it right at Jimmy, and it hits. Jimmy leans to his left, and stabilizes himself]"
203,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake. [cheers and claps abound]"
204,5,2,Man,Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my
205,5,2,Timmy Burch,[wailing] Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!
206,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice."
207,5,2,Big Gay Al,[enters the room] Hi ya fellas! [waves his left arm quickly]
208,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"How are you today, Scout?"
209,5,2,Big Gay Al,"I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!"
210,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay."
211,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?"
212,5,2,Scoutmaster 1,"Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong."
213,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts."
214,5,2,Big Gay Al,[Softly. Somber music plays.] Out of... Scouts?
215,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al."
216,5,2,Big Gay Al,But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.
217,5,2,Scoutmaster 2,"Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral."
218,5,2,Big Gay Al,I see...
219,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,It's nothing against you personally
220,5,2,Big Gay Al,What if I promise not to be gay anymore? [holds up a pinky] Pinky swear.
221,5,2,Scoutmaster 2,We think it's best you just... move on.
222,5,2,Big Gay Al,"[rejected] Right. Move on. [turns around, sighs, and walks out]"
223,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet."
224,5,2,Timmy Burch,[holding a gift] Timmih.
225,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,What's that?
226,5,2,Timmy Burch,"Hur livin' a lah, Timmih. [presents the gift]"
227,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,A present? You got me a p-present?
228,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
229,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"...[takes the gift] Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent. [opens the present] If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh? [pulls out the contents] Wow, a parka. [an orange one] You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim."
230,5,2,Timmy Burch,[all smiles] Tim-Timmy.
231,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits. [Timmy grins with anticipation as Jimmy dons the parka. Next shot is of Jimmy looking suspiciously like Kenny] This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around. [turns around to walk away]"
232,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [grins]
233,5,2,Jimbo and Ned,"There he is! Kill him! Kill him! [Ned fires three times] Oh, wait, that's not him. [the two men withdraw, and Jimmy keeps walking]"
234,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[calling back] Thanks again, Tim-Tim."
235,5,2,Timmy Burch,[thwarted] Tim-Timmay!
236,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Ah, bye, Scouts. [closes the drawer. The camera pans to show a man playing a piano] Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now."
237,5,2,Marc (Marc Shaiman),"Hey, don't yell at me! Ya asked me to come over and play sad songs for you to pack to, and then ya yell at me."
238,5,2,Big Gay Al,"[approaching] I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... ""I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay"" music."
239,5,2,Marc (Marc Shaiman),"[starts playing sprightly music] Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me."
240,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Oh! [buries his face in his left hand] Jesus, Marc."
241,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual."
242,5,2,Randy Marsh,Nice to meet you.
243,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends."
244,5,2,Stuart McCormick,"Your wife, huh?"
245,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.
246,5,2,Randy Marsh,"[nudges Stuart, who then smiles] Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then."
247,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Gonna go pound some brews, huh?"
248,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"And so I said to him, ""Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf."" [the other scouts laugh] Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?"
249,5,2,Timmy Burch,[resisting] Timmay.
250,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim. [the boys laugh, and Jimmy approaches] Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too. [laughter. Timmy gets angry when Jimmy offers him a Dr. Seuss-like hat.] Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat. [Timmy throws the hat down. Jimmy picks it back up and offers it again.] Just for a second, Timmy. [Timmy throws the hat back at him, an dhe picks it up again] Don't be a jerk, Timmy. [approaches with the hat, but Timmy smacks him away] Hey, don't push me!"
251,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [turns his chair to face Jimmy directly]
252,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Cripple fight! [the other boys cheer, but Mr. Grazier bursts through the doors]"
253,5,2,Mr Grazier,"That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats! [the boys turn left and go to their seats]"
254,5,2,Eric Cartman,Awww!
255,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier! [paces back and forth between tables] Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right! [there's no answer] When I ask you a question you will answer ""Yes, Scoutmaster!"" Do I make myself clear?!"
256,5,2,Other Scouts,"Yes, Scoutmaster!"
257,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be... [hushed] naked pictures [brings forth a camera] I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later."
258,5,2,Other Scouts,Awww.
259,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! ""We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"""
260,5,2,Eric Cartman,"[to Kenny] Man, this guy sucks."
261,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!"
262,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show. [pulls out a smiling Scout hand puppet] Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens. [pulls out a hammer with his left hand and whacks away at the puppet on his right hand. The Scouts are frightened] Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw! [his right hand is bleeding, leaving a small pool of blood under the puppet] Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!"
263,5,2,Other Scouts,"Yes, Scoutmaster! [the parents enter to pick up their boys]"
264,5,2,Mr Grazier,"[now hiding his right hand] Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we?"
265,5,2,Other Scouts,"Yes sir Scoutmaster! [the troops break and go to their parents. Mr. Grazier walks over to Randy and Stuart, with his right hand behnd his back]"
266,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape."
267,5,2,Stuart McCormick,Yeah. Now they're acting like men.
268,5,2,Mr Grazier,"Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside."
269,5,2,Randy Marsh,You bet.
270,5,2,Stuart McCormick,I heard that.
271,5,2,Randy Marsh,"See ya, Mr. Grazier. [Randy and Stuart walk out. Mr. Grazier waits till they're gone and then pulls out the pictures he'd just taken and reviews them]"
272,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Go away! I'm dead! [the door closes, and soon the South Park troop comes into view and stands in front of him]"
273,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh, well, here he is."
274,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!"
275,5,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
276,5,2,Big Gay Al,"I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts."
277,5,2,Stan Marsh,Kicked out? Oh no!
278,5,2,Eric Cartman,But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
279,5,2,Big Gay Al,Really? wull-why?
280,5,2,Butters Stotch,[pause. Stan and Cartman look to him] We can't tell you.
281,5,2,Big Gay Al,Why not?
282,5,2,Butters Stotch,"[approaches the kidney-shaped table and demonstrates] Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! [Al is shocked at the implication]"
283,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week."
284,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals."
285,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much."
286,5,2,Stan Marsh,What do we want?
287,5,2,Boys,Gays in Scouts!
288,5,2,Stan Marsh,When do we want it?
289,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
290,5,2,Stan Marsh,What do we want?
291,5,2,Boys,Gays in Scouts!
292,5,2,Stan Marsh,When do we want it?
293,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
294,5,2,Stan Marsh,What do we want?
295,5,2,Randy Marsh,"[slowly, as the boys and Stan continue] Oh, no."
296,5,2,Boys,Gays in Scouts!
297,5,2,Stan Marsh,When do we want it?
298,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
299,5,2,Stan Marsh,What do we want?
300,5,2,Boys,Gays in Scouts!
301,5,2,Stan Marsh,When do we want it?
302,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [the boys approach Henry's Supermarket]
303,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. [a little girl stands at the market's entrance]"
304,5,2,Little Girl,Puppies. Puppies for sale.
305,5,2,Eric Cartman,"[moves over to her] Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! [takes her box and looks inside, then tosses it away. She goes after the box]"
306,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, let's set up. [the table's legs come down and Cartman's picket is hung in front of the table. A mic and sound system are set up next to the table. A customer exits the market, and Stan whips out a petition board] Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? [the customer gets away, but another one comes] Uh, hello, gays in Scouts? [the customers ignore him] Goddamnit! [All the while Timmy looks down angrily at Jimmy]"
307,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?"
308,5,2,Stan Marsh,"That's a great idea! [takes the mic] Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!"
309,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[takes the mic] Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim. [Jimmy gets the big hat and turns to give it to Timmy, only to see him wheel away. Jimmy follows, and they end up in a parking lot away from the market] Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!"
310,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
311,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!"
312,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
313,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Put on the hat!
314,5,2,Timmy Burch,[smacks the hat down] Timmay!
315,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Pu-put it on!!
316,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. [he and Cartman leave the table and go towards Jimmy and Timmy. Timmy and Jimmy face off and start circling each other]"
317,5,2,Timmy Burch,[makes a fist] Timmih. Timmih.
318,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Not this year.
319,5,2,Timmy Burch,"Timmih, Timmih."
320,5,2,Eric Cartman,Cripple fight!
321,5,2,Timmy Burch,Haaa.
322,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Come on. Come on!
323,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
324,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Cripple fight! [after a moment, the congregants get up and leave]"
325,5,2,Eric Cartman,"[on speakers] Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! [the shoppers abandon their carts and exit]"
326,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Come on!
327,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,[struggling to get up] Uh.
328,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ, dude! [a crowd begins to gather]"
329,5,2,Susan,Oh my God!
330,5,2,Man 5,"Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon. [Jimmy gets up quickly and faces Timmy again]"
331,5,2,Timmy Burch,Hahnah Timmih.
332,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[swipes at him, but Timmy blocks] Huah!"
333,5,2,Timmy Burch,Hahnah Timmih.
334,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[swipes at Timmy again, but Timmy blocks] Come on!"
335,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
336,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"No! [swipes at him again, but Timmy blocks and quickly delivers a blow to the face, drawing fist blood] Ow!"
337,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Timmy? Timmy? [Timmy takes his hand and slowly rises to his feet. Jimmy helps him into the chair]I told you to put on the HAT!! [swings his right crutch and blows Timmy out of the chair again. Jimmy walks up to Timmy and pulls him up by the hair, and swings the right crutch at him, but Timmy blocks it and holds both crutches down] You dirty motherfucker! [hits Timmy with the crutches, and Timmy responds with a headbutt, knocking Jimmy down. Timmy goes down himself]"
338,5,2,Man 5,[just arriving] What's goin' on?
339,5,2,Man 6,[turns to answer] Some kind of gay pride rally.
340,5,2,Timmy Burch,Lah-livin' a lie!
341,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice."
342,5,2,Farmer,Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.
343,5,2,"Joe, of Joe n' Friends",[host of Joe n' Friends] This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
344,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off."
345,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"[voice only] The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as Always and 1941."
346,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,[at his desk] I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!
347,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred."
348,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,"[at her desk] It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate. [rises from her chair and pounds the desk] I am taking this case on, personally!"
349,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you."
350,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist. [pictured is Mr. Grazier being arrested, then his mug shot] This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now."
351,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,[voice only] Here's one. And here's another.
352,5,2,Stuart McCormick,Kenny?
353,5,2,Randy Marsh,Oh my God.
354,5,2,Field Reporter Chris and News Anchor Tom,"Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here."
355,5,2,Man 6,"Alright, boys, break it up."
356,5,2,Bailiff,All rise.
357,5,2,Chief Justice,"In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!"
358,5,2,Crowd,Alright! Yeah! Woohoo! [more cheering]
359,5,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too."
360,5,2,Crowd,"Yeah! [more cheering. Timmy and Jimmy, bruised and battered, sit next to each other]"
361,5,2,Chief Justice,"And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!"
362,5,2,Crowd,"Hooray, yeah, yeah! [more cheering]"
363,5,2,Stan Marsh,We did it! We did it!
364,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,I did it! I did it! Haha! [the press gathers in around her.]
365,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,"Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are. [each of the three Scout elders is in a stock, and underneath each one is written ""HOMOPHOBE"" The crowd throws stones at them.] And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys [the big bird comes down and plucks Kenny right up. The other kids, Al, and Gloria move aside and return, the kids stunned] five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al. [moves aside]"
366,5,2,Big Gay Al,[as the crowd cheers] Thank you all very much. But I don't want this. [the crowd quiets down and gets confused]
367,5,2,Crowd members,What's he saying?
368,5,2,Stan Marsh,Huh?
369,5,2,Big Gay Al,"Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club."
370,5,2,Man,"Uh, Hooray!"
371,5,2,Another Man,"Hooray, hey!"
372,5,2,Stan Marsh,"So wait, did we do good?"
373,5,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh yeah, ah I think so."
374,5,2,Eric Cartman,"Eh, we kick ass."
375,5,2,Big Gay Al,"[approaching the boys] Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream! [moves along]"
376,5,2,Steven Spielberg and Gloria Allred,[at the mic] You can't do this! You homophobe!
377,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts."
378,5,2,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
379,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts. [walks off]
380,5,2,Timmy Burch,Tim-mih.
381,5,2,Timmy Burch,"Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih. [on screen is a picture of Timmy and Jimmy, in a Photo Wiz program. Timmy traces a cutout around Jimmy's head] Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih. [he clips the head off and moves it to the right, and grins] Aaaaah."
382,5,2,Stan Marsh,"[stops at Timmy's room and enters. Timmy stops work to listen] Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! [walks out]"
383,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures."
384,5,2,Timmy Burch,"[rolls up to the scoutmaster] Uh, Timmih."
385,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,"Yes, Timmy? [Timmy hands him an envelope, which he opens. He takes out a picture] Oh dear. Jimmy?"
386,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Yes?
387,5,2,Head Scoutmaster,You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.
388,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,Out of Scouts? [the scoutmaster shows a picture of two naked men holding each other close from the waist down and looking at the camera. The paler man has Jimmy's head pasted over his]
389,5,2,Timmy Burch,"[with eyes half-closed, waves at Jimmy and grins] Tim-mih."
390,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,"What? [the two other Scoutmasters come up behind Jimmy, pull him out of his chair, and carry him towards the entrance] Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!"
391,5,2,Stan Marsh,"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay."
392,5,2,Butters Stotch,Me neither. [the two Scoutmasters prepare to toss him out the doors]
393,5,2,Jimmy Valmer,No! No! [the Scoutmasters toss him a good distance]
394,5,2,Timmy Burch,[triumphantly] Timmay!
395,5,3,Magician,"Okay, Carol, put the card you picked back into the deck so I can't see ittwah. [Butters and Kenny are watching as Stan and Kyle rush up]"
396,5,3,Stan Marsh,"What's going on? [he and Kyle have ice cream cones. He has vanilla, Kyle strawberry]"
397,5,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?"
398,5,3,David Blaine,"Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd. [Carol takes the card and shows it to the crowd. It is an ace of clubs] Was that the card you picked?"
399,5,3,Carol,"No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts."
400,5,3,David Blaine,Four of hearts? Really? Look again.
401,5,3,Carol,[looks and find the four of hearts in her hand] Daa-ah!
402,5,3,Crowd,Oooohhhh! [applause]
403,5,3,Elderly Woman,Whoa
404,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"That's pretty cool, dude!"
405,5,3,Eric Cartman,[walking up] Who's this asshole?
406,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass."
407,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?"
408,5,3,David Blaine,"Sir, c- could you come over here? [Jimbo walks over] Now, what I want you to do, Mr..."
409,5,3,Jimbo,Kern.
410,5,3,David Blaine,"Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind."
411,5,3,Jimbo,[shuts his eyes and keeps them shut] O-kay.
412,5,3,David Blaine,"Okay, jus... s think about your card. [a few seconds pass] okay, look at me. [Jimbo looks at him] Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass."
413,5,3,Jimbo,Huh??
414,5,3,David Blaine,"Go on, reach up your ass."
415,5,3,Jimbo,"[reaches into his ass and digs around] Uh, I don't feel nothin'."
416,5,3,David Blaine,Deeper.
417,5,3,Jimbo,[groans as he goes deeper] Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait... [pulls out a card and cleans the crap off it]
418,5,3,David Blaine,Was that the card you picked?
419,5,3,Jimbo,[in disbelief] Yes! Oh my God!
420,5,3,Man,O-hoho! [more crowd reaction]
421,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that's cool!"
422,5,3,Stan Marsh,How'd he do that??
423,5,3,David Blaine,"Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch. [goes into a meditative state] Watch. [slowly, he rises into the air]"
424,5,3,Crowd,Whoa!!!
425,5,3,Stan Marsh,No way!
426,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
427,5,3,Blaintologist,"[passing out pamphlets through the crowd] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids,  take a pamphlet. [Kyle takes one and reads from it]"
428,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go."
429,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!"
430,5,3,Speaker,"Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?"
431,5,3,Stan Marsh,His a-miracles?
432,5,3,Steven,"Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader."
433,5,3,Eric Cartman,When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
434,5,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
435,5,3,Steven,"Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?"
436,5,3,Butters Stotch,I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
437,5,3,Steven,"...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-"
438,5,3,Butters Stotch,And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
439,5,3,Steven,"Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you? [focus on a stunned Kyle] You're not really happy."
440,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[thinking] I'm not really happy.
441,5,3,Steven,Your potential hasn't even been reached.
442,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[thinking] My potential hasn't even been reached.
443,5,3,Steven,"[holds up the book] If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?"
444,5,3,Eric Cartman,Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
445,5,3,Steven,That's right.
446,5,3,Eric Cartman,Cool.
447,5,3,Sheila Broflovski,"Ike, eat your gefilte fish. [Ike pulls away as far as he can]"
448,5,3,Ike Broflovski,No-oo.
449,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes in with Blaine's book] Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
450,5,3,Sheila Broflovski,"That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!"
451,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four...."
452,5,3,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this."
453,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95."

455,5,3,Barber,Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
456,5,3,Butters Stotch,"[Solemnly] I am prepared. [the barber takes the clippers and clips Butters' hair off in one swoop. The hair ends up on the floor in one piece] Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here."
457,5,3,Barber,Next? [Mr. Garrison appears...]
458,5,3,Steven,"Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean. [a shot of the new recruits. They all look the same] Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head."
459,5,3,Recruits,Wow!
460,5,3,Steven,So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize! [eight boys gravitate towards each other]
461,5,3,Stan Marsh,"[talking to a boy between him and Cartman] Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea."
462,5,3,Butters Stotch,"Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle."
463,5,3,Stan Marsh,"No, I'm Stan."
464,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[behind Butters] You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
465,5,3,Stan Marsh,Who are you?
466,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm Kyle.
467,5,3,Eric Cartman,"[thinking he's indistinguishable] Heheh, guess who I am, guys?"
468,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here."
469,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[steps back to join Stan] What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
470,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home."
471,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.
472,5,3,Stan Marsh,"I don't care! I'm leaving! [walks towards the door, but a man blocks the way] 'Scuse me. [eerie music begins]"
473,5,3,Aide,Where are you going?
474,5,3,Stan Marsh,I'm going home.
475,5,3,Aide,You don't want to go home.
476,5,3,Stan Marsh,You said we're free to leave whenever we want
477,5,3,Aide,You are.
478,5,3,Stan Marsh,Move out of the way.
479,5,3,Aide,I'm not in the way. You are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it
480,5,3,Stan Marsh,"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave."
481,5,3,Aide,"Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave."
482,5,3,Stan Marsh,"[begins to back away, intimidated] That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay."
483,5,3,Aide,That's great news. [escorts Stan back to the group]
484,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Okay, it's all clear. [exits with Kyle]"
485,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,What are we doing?
486,5,3,Stan Marsh,We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
487,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere."
488,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!"
489,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something."
490,5,3,Stan Marsh,A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
491,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
492,5,3,Stan Marsh,"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!"
493,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not going anywhere!
494,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!"
495,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
496,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh wait, who am I again?"
497,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,You're Stan.
498,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second. [pulls out his hat and puts it on] Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!"
499,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. [turns and walks back to his room. Stan turns back to face the hall and watched Kyle walk away]
500,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, please. You- [looks down and to the left, then looks up] You're my best friend."
501,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. [opens the door to his room and walks in. Stan looks, then turns towards the exit and walks out]"
502,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you."
503,5,3,Elderly Woman,"Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic."
504,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew."
505,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,That's right.
506,5,3,Elderly Woman,So you're not a cult?
507,5,3,Eric Cartman,"[giggles] Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you."
508,5,3,Elderly Woman,"Well, alright, come on in."
509,5,3,Eric Cartman,Cool. [the woman shows the boys in]
510,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square."
511,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?"
512,5,3,Elderly Woman,"No, not really."
513,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often."
514,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night. [closes his book] We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
515,5,3,Eric Cartman,He's going to eat his own head.
516,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,How many tickets can we put you down for?
517,5,3,Elderly Woman,"Oh, I can't go."
518,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person."
519,5,3,Elderly Woman,I am happy.
520,5,3,Eric Cartman,No you're not.
521,5,3,Elderly Woman,Yes I am.
522,5,3,Eric Cartman,No you're not.
523,5,3,Elderly Woman,I really am.
524,5,3,Eric Cartman,No you're not.
525,5,3,Elderly Woman,But I am.
526,5,3,Eric Cartman,No you're not.
527,5,3,Elderly Woman,"Alright, two tickets"
528,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Great!
529,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
530,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize."
531,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- [they reach the corner. Facing them on the opposite corner is Stan, standing by his bike]"
532,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. [turns right and walks down the street. Kyle looks back at Stan for a few seconds, then follows Cartman. Stan turns and walks down the street in the same direction Kyle and Cartman were walking, but stops when a car appears in front of him. He sees some adult Blaintologists inside. The driver starts the car and moves towards Stan, who turns about face and begins to run with his bike. The car looms behind him and he lets go of his bike.]"
533,5,3,Stan Marsh,"HaaAAAA! [the car totals the bike, bumps Stan onto the sidewalk, and peels away.]"
534,5,3,Driver,"You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner! [Stan looks at the car, scared.]"

758,5,4,Eric Cartman,Nuh uh!
759,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yuh huh!
760,5,4,Eric Cartman,[looks at his purchase] But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
761,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!"
762,5,4,Eric Cartman,You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.

771,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!"
772,5,4,Eric Cartman,Just give me back my money...

780,5,4,Eric Cartman,"You will? Oh, cool!"
781,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?"

840,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Your grandma?
841,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down."
842,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Oh. [strokes his chin] Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that."
843,5,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Poor grandma...
844,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. [through the window, Scott is seen going for the money]"

846,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Here you go.
847,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! [Scott withholds the money]"
848,5,4,Scott Tenorman,But... just one thing before I give it to you:
849,5,4,Eric Cartman,What?
850,5,4,Scott Tenorman,I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
851,5,4,Eric Cartman,Huh?
852,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
853,5,4,Eric Cartman,Why??

855,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[looks around to make sure no one else is watching, then quickly] Please Scott give me my money."
856,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Nono, get down on your knees. [Cartman begins to get on his knees] Lower your head [Cartman lowers it], and say ""I beg you to give me back my money."""
857,5,4,Eric Cartman,I beg you to give me back my money.
858,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Now say, ""I'm a little piggy."""

868,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"You mean this? [Cartman brightens up] You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?!

869,5,4,Eric Cartman,What- What are you doing?? [the bills light up and burn from one end to the other. Scott lets the burning bills float away] No!.. wuh...why?
870,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! [turns around and enters the house, shutting the door behind him. Cartman then turns and walks towards the street anew. Halfway there, he looks at his mitts, then grows indignant]"

877,5,4,Butters Stotch,Wuh what are you gonna do?
878,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony [flips the first page over to reveal a drawing of a pony and takes up the pointer with his left hand], we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. [the other kids just stare back, but Cartman continues] It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!"

881,5,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?"
882,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, right. Why should we care? [slaps the pointer into his right hand] Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!"" [flips to the next page, which has written on it ""$16.12"" with double underline] Now who's with me?!! [turns around to find only one other person in the basement]"
883,5,4,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
884,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[slaps his forehead and sighs] Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!"
885,5,4,Timmy Burch,"Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih. [rolls out of the room. Cartman is stunned, then angry]"
886,5,4,Eric Cartman,"There we go. [stands aside] Come and get it. [camera pulls back to reveal a pony nearby] ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. [the pony looks, then approaches] Come on, good pony. That's it! [the pony sniffs the wiener] Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! [the pony bares its teeth... only to start licking the wiener] Oh no, pony, he'll like that."
887,5,4,Jimbo Kern,[rushing up with Ned after eying Cartman in the corral] Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
888,5,4,Eric Cartman,"No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. [by this time, the pony is sucking on the wiener]"
889,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know."
890,5,4,Eric Cartman,He said it was okay.
891,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Alright, then. [turns to walk away, but remembers something] Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?"
892,5,4,Eric Cartman,Because [ominously] of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
893,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there."
894,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[noticing the sucking] Not like that, pony! [slaps the wiener out of its mouth]"
895,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. [the pony reaches for the wiener and starts sucking it again]"
896,5,4,Eric Cartman,Whattayou mean?
897,5,4,Jimbo Kern,Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
898,5,4,Eric Cartman,How do I do that?
899,5,4,Jimbo Kern,[pops up] What do you see? [Ned pops up. All three are in camouflage]
900,5,4,Eric Cartman,I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
901,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill."
902,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!"
903,5,4,Jimbo Kern,Oo what's a Radiohead?
904,5,4,Eric Cartman,"You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner..."
905,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,Mmuh what am I doing here?
906,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!"
907,5,4,Eric Cartman,"So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a [British accent] li'l ol' scheme [normal] that involves them."
908,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Nice thinking, young hunter."
909,5,4,Eric Cartman,Whoa!
910,5,4,Jimbo Kern,What?
911,5,4,Eric Cartman,I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
912,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"What?! Give me those! [rips the binoculars away and looks for himself] Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!"
913,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,Mn let me see.
914,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Radiohead. Yes, of course. [drops down]"
915,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!"
916,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,Let me see. Let me see.
917,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Here you go. [allows Ned to look through the binoculars, and Ned begins to masturbate] Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?"
918,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,Kinda.
919,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, stop it! [the porch light turns on and Mr. Tenorman walks out the front door. Jimbo and Ned freeze]"
920,5,4,Mr Tenorman,"Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?!"
921,5,4,Jimbo Kern,[hushed] Oh crap!
922,5,4,Mr Tenorman,Who's out there?
923,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"[hushed] Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!"
924,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,I can't.
925,5,4,Mr Tenorman,"Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police! [Jimbo and Ned witness other men rise from the pushes and split. Among them are Randy, in a Groucho Marx outfit; Gerald, dressed as a clown; Stuart, with a paper shopping bag over his head; one man in scuba gear, and one more man]"
926,5,4,A man,"Whoa, I gotta get out of here! [Mr. Tenorman is left wondering why so many men were there.]"
927,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[cheerfully] Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?"
928,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Uh huh.
929,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. [gloats] Everyone's gonna be there!"
930,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me."
931,5,4,Eric Cartman,"You're welcome, Scott. [turns and walks away]"
932,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? [activates the screen and then walks off stage]"
933,5,4,Kurt Loder,"Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now. [Cartman joins the crowd and stands next to Scott, his mood changing from happy to mad] Guys, when is the next album coming out?"
934,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[has taped over the band's answers with his own — first as Thom Yorke] That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. [now as Johnny Greenwood] Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. [Now as Ed O'Brien] I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?"
935,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? [Scott looks down, and ponders Cartman's role]"
936,5,4,Kurt Loder,And will there be a new tour?
937,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[Now as Phil Selway] Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. [Now as Thom Yorke] Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!"
938,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. [Scott is gone] Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! [feedback is heard] What a retard! [the kids around him face right] And now everyone saw it! [looks around]"
939,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[off screen] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! [moves aside to show an ever bigger TV, which is turned on. Scott has apparently filmed Cartman earlier begging for his money]"
940,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[on screen] '""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""' [the kids begin to laugh hard, then harder. The same clip is shown over and over, and Kenny begins to laugh. Soon he can't control himself, and falls over dead. His ghost appears and continues laughing]"
941,5,4,Stan Marsh,"[looks over at Kenny's corpse] Oh my God, he killed Kenny."
942,5,4,Eric Cartman,[seething with anger] That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
943,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! [goes into whispers and brings out a protractor and a compass] Then... that... [finishes his plan] Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! [a truly evil grin appears on his face.]"
944,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Cartman, what do you want?"
945,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!"
946,5,4,Stan Marsh,Got what all figured out?
947,5,4,Eric Cartman,How to get Scott Tenorman back!
948,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[rolls his eyes] Oh, Jesus!"
949,5,4,Eric Cartman,"I just finished planning a brilliant [British accent] li'l scheme [normal] that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. [holds out two fingers]"
950,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, so what's the plan?"
951,5,4,Eric Cartman,"It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?"
952,5,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
953,5,4,Eric Cartman,"So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! [camera pulls back to reveal the setup: pony, scarecrow with wiener attached to groin]"
954,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,...What?
955,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! [laughs demonically] Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! [nothing happens for a few seconds]"
956,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You're such a dumbass, Cartman. [he and Stan turn and walk away]"
957,5,4,Eric Cartman,"...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! [walks over to the pony] Ready, pony? [the pony nods] Bite it! [the pony bites off a piece of the wiener] Yes!! [exults]"

Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it?

969,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Thennn why are you telling me?

975,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Hey.
976,5,4,Eric Cartman,"I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. [shows him the face of the ticket] Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!"
977,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great."
978,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[getting smug] Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!"
979,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Wow, a pony ride. Neat."
980,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, it will be very neat, Scott."
981,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?"
982,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] A little penis-biting, perhaps?"

984,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?"
985,5,4,Scott Tenorman,How can I turn it down?
986,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. [Scott turns around and closes the door] Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. [leaves]"
987,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned."
988,5,4,Mrs Tenorman,Oh dear.
989,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do."
990,5,4,Mr Tenorman,"[drops his paper. Both parents rise] Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter."
991,5,4,Mrs Tenorman,We sure can.
992,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now."
993,5,4,Mrs Tenorman,"[hugs him] Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you."

997,5,4,Buddy 1,"What are you doing, Scott?"
998,5,4,Scott Tenorman,What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
999,5,4,Buddy 2,[holds out a bag full of hair] We got everyone we could find to chip in. [his friend giggles] There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.
1000,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Awesome! [yanks the bag away, opens it, and mixes the pubes into the chili]"
1001,5,4,Buddy 1,"Oh, dude!"
1002,5,4,Scott Tenorman,The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
1003,5,4,Buddy 2,"Yeah! [hi-fives Scott, and the three laugh heartily]"
1004,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[steps out of the ticket booth to greet them] Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!"
1005,5,4,Stan Marsh,"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman."
1006,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[smug] Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!"
1007,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. [looks at Stan, who's smiling]"
1008,5,4,Eric Cartman,What's so funny?
1009,5,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?"
1010,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Not yet, but they will be."
1011,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, sure. [As Chef arrives, Stan and Kyle leave]"
1012,5,4,Chef,"Hello, Eric!"
1013,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey, Chef."
1014,5,4,Chef,I made some chili to enter into the contest.
1015,5,4,Eric Cartman,What contest?
1016,5,4,Chef,"This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?"
1017,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here."
1018,5,4,Chef,It's my special recipe.
1019,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[seeing Scott, interrupts. Slowly and sweetly] Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! [Scott holds a small container of chili]"
1020,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything."
1021,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[overjoyed] Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!"
1022,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
1023,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive."
1024,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
1025,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[sighs silently] Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. [Scott leaves] Goddamnit!"
1026,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[setting his plate before Cartman] Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?"
1027,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[inspecting the dish] Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. [hands his plate to Scott, who takes it to his end of the table and starts eating]"
1028,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it."
1029,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright. [takes the dish and starts eating. Both boys munch away for a few moments] Hey, this is great! [Stan and Kyle stifle giggles]"
1030,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Eh, it's a special recipe."
1031,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[begins to wolf down the food] Gawh, this is really good, Scott!"
1032,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you."
1033,5,4,Eric Cartman,"What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [Everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]"
1034,5,4,Scott Tenorman,What?!
1035,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [A shot of Cartman telling Denkins of such a thing. Denkins is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [A shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [The Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the ""starving"" pony, but upon seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them, and they go down]"
1036,5,4,Mr Denkins,"[looks of horror surround him] Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights."
1037,5,4,Scott Tenorman,My... mom and dad are... dead? [A shot of Officer Barbrady taking a report from Denkins]
1038,5,4,Eric Cartman,"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [A shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away. The pony munches at some grass] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behnd Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [A gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."""
1039,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[looks at Cartman for a while, realizing what's just happened] Oh my God! [gagging, he fishes through the plate and finds his mom's wedding ring, still on her finger. He tosses it away] Oh my God!! [vomits off to the side]"
1040,5,4,Eric Cartman,[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are way stunned]
1041,5,4,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ, dude!"
1042,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[grief-stricken, he buries his face on the table] My mom and dad are dead! [pounds the table] No! NOOO!! [Radiohead arrives and stands behind Scott. Stan notices]"

1069,5,5,Terrance,"Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the [faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaart. Whatever Terrance is saying is drowned out by the fart], and that's how you [boys join in] get to the auto garage!"
1070,5,5,Phillip,Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
1071,5,5,Terrance,Sure. You go the same way [Kyle chimes in] except stick your finger up your ass.
1072,5,5,Phillip,"No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?"
1073,5,5,Terrance,OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
1074,5,5,Phillip,"Alright, no problem, buddy. [Terrance lowers his pants enough to show his ass; Phillip sticks his finger in there] Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?"
1075,5,5,Terrance,[now wearing a mechanic's hat] You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
1076,5,5,Phillip,Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
1077,5,5,Stan Marsh,Because I had an itch up my ass.
1078,5,5,Terrance,"Because I had an itch up my ass. [the two laugh, then the boys laugh, then the laughter dies down. Terrance farts again, and they both laugh as the camera's iris shuts slowly.]"
1079,5,5,Terrance,Terrance & Phillip will be right back...
1080,5,5,Phillip,...after these messages. [toilet water erupts from the toilet and blows them off camera]
1081,5,5,Stan Marsh,When are they gonna make new ones?
1082,5,5,Announcer 3,"[On TV, ""HEY KIDS!!,"" white on green, appears and gets bigger, then dances on a blinking background] Hey kids, don't miss the greatest event of the year! This Thursday night at the Denver Coliseum, see Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person! [""Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person"" appears, then Terrance and Phillip flank the text on either side]"
1083,5,5,Stan Marsh,What's this?
1084,5,5,Announcer 3,"[scenes from various episodes appear] One night and one night only, see all your favorite Terrance and Phillip bits live! [Kenny starts babbling incoherently]"
1085,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God!
1086,5,5,Eric Cartman,[running in circles] You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
1087,5,5,Stan Marsh,Enough! I know!
1088,5,5,Announcer,"To order tickets, call TicketSlave NOW!! [a crawl at the bottom of the screen, black on red, reads ""CALL NOW! 555-TIXS""]"
1089,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,Write the number down! Write the number down!!
1090,5,5,Stan Marsh,Dude! Did you get 'em?
1091,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!"
1092,5,5,Eric Cartman,Awesome! Give me mine! [Kyle gives them out]
1093,5,5,Butters Stotch,"Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?"
1094,5,5,Stan Marsh,Yep. Tomorrow night.
1095,5,5,Ms Choksondik,"[enters and goes before the chalkboard] Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day. [writes it on the board] and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival."
1096,5,5,Class,Oohh.
1097,5,5,Ms Choksondik,"The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it. [moves aside for the heads. Two men and a woman come in, each of them sporting a bow on the left lapel.]"
1098,5,5,Older man,"Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town."
1099,5,5,Younger man,"[slowly waves his left forearm in a broad arc, to the left, palm out] You care very much about the earth, don't you?"
1100,5,5,Class,Yes.
1101,5,5,Older man,"Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night. [the boys stir and the camera closes in]"
1102,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,What??
1103,5,5,Younger man,We've all gotta pitch in.
1104,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night."
1105,5,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
1106,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
1107,5,5,Kenny McCormick,Yeah.
1108,5,5,Older man,You... what??
1109,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
1110,5,5,Older man,And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?
1111,5,5,Eric Cartman,"Well yeah, dude."
1112,5,5,Older man,"[slowly waves his left forearm in a broad arc, to the left, palm out] You don't care about Terrance and Phillip. [the boys stare back] Nothing matters more than saving the planet from Republicans. [draws close and repeats the arm movement] You don't need to see Terrance and Phillip."
1113,5,5,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, we really, really do."
1114,5,5,Older man,"[to the woman at his left, whispers] Their will is strong."
1115,5,5,Ms Choksondik,"I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day."
1116,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[fielding] Uhuh, but that's why we're going."
1117,5,5,Stan Marsh,Huh?
1118,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival."
1119,5,5,Younger man,You can get Terrance and Phillip to perform? [to the older man] That would be great. Terrance and Phillip would draw huge ratings from children all over the country.
1120,5,5,Older man,"Very well, kids; we'll work on getting the event ready here, and you go get Terrance and Phillip."
1121,5,5,The Boys,All right!
1122,5,5,Older man,[ominously] But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.
1123,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[the boys look sufficiently scared] Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!"
1124,5,5,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen! [the kids cheer and hoot. Spotlights wash over the audience, their beams moving around aimlessly] Put your hands together for... Terrance! [only one spotlight remains on, illuminating the mic, and the music cuts off]"
1125,5,5,Terrance,"[approaches the mic from behind the curtains] Hellooo, Den-ver! [the roar of the audience fades quickly as they see only Terrance there, and he's not quite himself. A smattering of applause follows]"
1126,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat."
1127,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he looks terrible."
1128,5,5,Terrance,"How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh. [Terrance farts and the audience claps awkwardly] Hey, do you all remember this one? ""Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass."" ""Reallih? Let me take a look."" ""Look closer."" [farts, and laughs]"
1129,5,5,Stan Marsh,Uuuuhh.
1130,5,5,Eric Cartman,Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
1131,5,5,Eric Cartman,Phil-lip!
1132,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,Phil-lip!
1133,5,5,Ed Sullivan Audience Members,Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip!
1134,5,5,Terrance,"[""Phil-lip! Phil-lip!""] And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! [the crowd cheers and music plays a bit]"
1135,5,5,Phillip Stand in,Hello Terrance.
1136,5,5,Terrance,Hello Phillip.
1137,5,5,Stan Marsh,Phillip? That's not Phillip.
1138,5,5,Terrance,"Say, Phillip, I have a question for you."
1139,5,5,Phillip Stand in,"Ho-okay, shoot. [bends down to receive the fart. Terrance bends over and farts on ""Phillip's"" face. They both laugh]"
1140,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?"
1141,5,5,Eric Cartman,I think this new guy's funny.
1142,5,5,Terrance,And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. [he and his partner pull out top hats]
1143,5,5,Phillip Stand in,"Excuse me, sir. Do you know Who farted?"
1144,5,5,Terrance,He sure did.
1145,5,5,Phillip Stand in,What's the person's name?
1146,5,5,Terrance,Who.
1147,5,5,Phillip Stand in,The guy that farted!
1148,5,5,Terrance,Who!
1149,5,5,Phillip Stand in,The person that passed gas!
1150,5,5,Terrance,Who passed gas!
1151,5,5,Phillip Stand in,"Now, why are you asking me?"
1152,5,5,Terrance,That's the man's name?
1153,5,5,Phillip Stand in,That's Who's name?
1154,5,5,Terrance,Yes!
1155,5,5,Phillip Stand in,"Something very terrible has happened in the world of Terrance and Phillip, and we've got to find out what."
1156,5,5,Phillip Stand in,"Look, buddy, all I'm trying to find out is What's the guy's name that farted?"
1157,5,5,Terrance,"Right, the guy that drank his own urine."
1158,5,5,Phillip Stand in,Who?
1159,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this. [they reach the dressing room, but a bouncer stands in the way] 'Scuse us."
1160,5,5,Bouncer,Where do you think you're going?
1161,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,We have to talk to Terrance.
1162,5,5,Bouncer,"Hyeah, right."
1163,5,5,Stan Marsh,It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
1164,5,5,Bouncer,"Then get in the ""Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club"" line. [points to the line, which has a lot more kids waiting to see Terrance. The boys turn to see...]"
1165,5,5,Eric Cartman,"Aw, dude, gay!"
1166,5,5,Stan Marsh,You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
1167,5,5,Bouncer,"You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face! [the boys head for the end of the line]"
1168,5,5,Eric Cartman,Racist! [a boy wearing glasses watches the foursome approach. The boys fall in]
1169,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Man, this sucks!"
1170,5,5,Boy in glasses,"[quite timidly] Are you guys official presidents, too?"
1171,5,5,Eric Cartman,"Don't talk to us, kid."
1172,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! Look at that line! [a post next to it reads ""FEMALE GROUPIES AND OTHER RANDOM SLUTS"" An obese woman stands last in line] It's way shorter."
1173,5,5,Stan Marsh,I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
1174,5,5,Eric Cartman,Kenny's a random slut. [a look of anger flashes across Kenny's face]
1175,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on. [moves to the other line. His friends follow.] Sshh. [stretches the fat woman's pants enough so that all four of them climb in and disappear under her fat]"
1176,5,5,Terrance,"Mmm. Mmm, yummy. [spanks her twice] Mmm. [they separate a bit]"
1177,5,5,Groupie,It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.
1178,5,5,Terrance,"We sure did, baby. [stands her up quickly and she looks back, disappointed in his reaction] Next? [the obese woman comes in happily]"
1179,5,5,Obese Woman,[voice trembling] Hello Terrance. I'm such a huuuge fan.
1180,5,5,Terrance,You're a huge fan alright!
1181,5,5,Obese Woman,Can I just have you sign my breasts?
1182,5,5,Terrance,But what do I get in return?
1183,5,5,Obese Woman,Whatever you want. [starts making out with him]
1184,5,5,Terrance,"Oh yeah. [lays down on the sofa, under her] Oh, that's good, baby."
1185,5,5,Obese Woman,"Oh, Terrance, I love you."
1186,5,5,Terrance,"You like that? [the woman unzips his pants, then her own]"
1187,5,5,Obese Woman,I love you! [coitus ensues]
1188,5,5,Terrance,Yeah.
1189,5,5,Obese Woman,I LOVE you!
1190,5,5,Terrance,Ah good.
1191,5,5,Obese Woman,I LOVE YOU!!
1192,5,5,Terrance,Yeah-
1193,5,5,Both,[reaching climax] OH!!! [Cartman leaps out the back of the woman's pants]
1194,5,5,Eric Cartman,"Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! [Terrance and the woman stand up]"
1195,5,5,Terrance,"Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?"
1196,5,5,Obese woman,What the hell? [the other three boys climb out]
1197,5,5,Terrance,Oh wow! We had quadruplets! [the woman throws up her arms and runs out screaming]
1198,5,5,Stan Marsh,"We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here."
1199,5,5,Terrance,"Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids. [gets a pen and paper] What do you want, an autograph or something?"
1200,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform."
1201,5,5,Terrance,"Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?"
1202,5,5,Stan Marsh,But where's Phillip?
1203,5,5,Terrance,[crosses his arms and looks mad] Who?
1204,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Phillip, your partner."
1205,5,5,Terrance,"Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, ""Hey, where's Phillip?"" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK! [shot of the boys listening] You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!"
1206,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,But the guy who replaced him sucks!
1207,5,5,Terrance,"Ah, I know. [sulks away from the sofa] I know he sucks [walks to his dresser and mirror. The boys are seen in the reflection] To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?"
1208,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip."
1209,5,5,Terrance,"Ogh, whatever. [turns around to face the boys] The point is, Phillip and I are through. [wistfully] And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money."
1210,5,5,Stan Marsh,What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
1211,5,5,Terrance,"HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do [does a quote with his index and middle fingers from both hands] ""more serious"" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto."
1212,5,5,Kenny McCormick,(Toronto?)
1213,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,[pleading] But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
1214,5,5,Terrance,"Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. [the boys look at each other in dismay]"
1215,5,5,Older man,"[through a bullhorn] Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work!"
1216,5,5,Clyde Donovan,"Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming."
1217,5,5,Older man,"That's not true. [waves his right forearm slowly to the right, palm out] Global warming is going to kill us all. [repeats the arm movement] The Republicans are responsible."
1218,5,5,Clyde Donovan,"Thank you. [turns and returns to work. Stan and friends come in from the other direction and stop at a sign announcing Terrance and Phillip: ""TERRANCE & PHILLIP As Promised By KYLE AND HIS FRIENDS""]"
1219,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, dude."
1220,5,5,Older man,"[arriving with his assistants] Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule."
1221,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Uuuh, we didn't get them."
1222,5,5,Older man,[gravely] You what?
1223,5,5,Stan Marsh,"They're not together anymore, dude."
1224,5,5,Younger man,You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.
1225,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy."
1226,5,5,Older man,"You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!"
1227,5,5,Stan Marsh,But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
1228,5,5,Older man,"Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements. [the three of them start to move away] Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives. [leaves]"
1229,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada."
1230,5,5,Eric Cartman,Weak.
1231,5,5,Phillip,"Ahhh [leaps on his rival, and both lose their swords. The two scuffle on the floor for a few seconds. Phillip's rival fends him off, but Phillip picks up the rival's sword and wounds him with it. We soon learn this is Act 5, Scene 2 of the play, the finale. And so...]"
1232,5,5,King Claudius,Part them; they are incensed.
1233,5,5,Hamlet,"[Phillip] Nay, come, again."
1234,5,5,Queen Gertrude,Aaaah! [falls]
1235,5,5,Osric,"[steps forth.] Look to the queen there, buddih! [Hamlet looks over his left shoulder]"
1236,5,5,Horatio,"They bleed on both sides. [Hamlet goes to check on the Queen] How is it, my lord?"
1237,5,5,Osric,"How is't, Laertes?"
1238,5,5,Laertes,"Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery."
1239,5,5,Hamlet,How does the queen?
1240,5,5,King Claudius,"Hey guy, she swounds to see them bleed, buddih. [in the audience Stan and Kyle sigh deeply and Kenny plays with a toy plane, Cartman is asleep]"
1241,5,5,Queen Gertrude,"No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. Blagh! [dies]"
1242,5,5,Hamlet,O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.
1243,5,5,Laertes,"[genuflects next to the poisoned sword] It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame."
1244,5,5,Hamlet,"[picks up the poisoned sword] The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work, buddih! [Stabs King Claudius]"
1245,5,5,All,Treason! treason!
1246,5,5,King Claudius,"O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt."
1247,5,5,Hamlet,"Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother."
1248,5,5,King Claudius,Blagh! [dies]
1249,5,5,Laertes,"He is served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Blagh! [dies]"
1250,5,5,Hamlet,"Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act, [chuckles] Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you, buddih--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest, guy; report me and my cause aright, to the unsatisfied. [chuckles]"
1251,5,5,Horatio,"Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih."
1252,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? [Kenny continues playing with his plane]"
1253,5,5,Hamlet,"...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh. [dies]"
1254,5,5,Horatio,"Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!..."
1255,5,5,Stan Marsh,[reaching Phillip] Phillip! Phillip!
1256,5,5,Phillip,Yes?
1257,5,5,Stan Marsh,Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
1258,5,5,Phillip,"Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there."
1259,5,5,Stan Marsh,"[stammering] Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-"
1260,5,5,Phillip,AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
1261,5,5,Stan Marsh,But we need you!
1262,5,5,Phillip,"Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? [farts and laughs despite himself]"
1263,5,5,Eric Cartman,"Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!"
1264,5,5,Phillip,"Yeah, whatever, kid."
1265,5,5,Stan Marsh,"He'll do it, dude."
1266,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side."
1267,5,5,Phillip,What?
1268,5,5,The other boys,What?
1269,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."""
1270,5,5,Phillip,Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
1271,5,5,Stan Marsh,Two thousand dollars.
1272,5,5,Phillip,"[opens the driver-side door] I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details. [hands Stan a business card] Gotta run! [peels away]"
1273,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there."
1274,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times."
1275,5,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies."
1276,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[silent for a bit, then] Ih-it'll be okay."
1277,5,5,Older man,"[through a bullhorn] Work faster! Faster, children! Earth Day is coming! [they approach and ascend a stage set up for Terrance and Phillip. Stan and friends are already there, waiting] Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up."
1278,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,They said they'd come.
1279,5,5,Stan Marsh,I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
1280,5,5,Older man,"[moves to stand behind the boys with his assistants flanking him] Maybe you kids don't understand how important Earth Day is for the future of our planet. Maybe you need some convincing. Carl? [the younger man, now known as Carl, takes an Earth Day meat cleaver and chops off Kenny's left hand]"
1281,5,5,Kenny McCormick,(AAAAHH!)
1282,5,5,Stan Marsh,Oh my God!
1283,5,5,Phillip,"[arriving] Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?"
1284,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,He's here! [Stan and Cartman smile]
1285,5,5,Older man,"Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event."
1286,5,5,Phillip,Whatever. Where's my check? [Terrance enters from the other side of the stage.]
1287,5,5,Terrance,"Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?"
1288,5,5,Phillip,[angrily] What's HE doing here?
1289,5,5,"The Earth Day Brainwashing Committee 
 Jack Farliss
 Carl
 Woman","Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it. [a zoom-out shows Terrance and Phillip facing away from each other]"
1290,5,5,Kyle Broflovski,Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
1291,5,5,Stan Marsh,"Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first."
1292,5,5,Phillip,"So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!"

[a shot of a poster announcing their next performance] Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere. [stock footage of Las Vegas in the 1960s] At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show [stock footage of the building the show was filmed at]. where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time."

[Phillip farts. A man and woman laugh, and soon the audience joins in. Ed claps joyfully as well. The crowd is soon roaring with cheers and then Terrance farts in return. More laughter and cheers] It was the birth of Canadian comedy. [a shot of Terrance and Phillip using their fart routine in their music act, a shot of them with President Gerald Ford] Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meeting some of America's most influential people.

[a shot of Terrance and Phillip propped up as scarecrows out on a field] But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues. [a shot of Johnny Carson laughing it up with Terrance and Phillip] The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip. [a shot of the Donny and Marie Show with Terrance and Phillip cavorting in the background] Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine. [The Times, Teen Heat] And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip. [From episode #102, ""Terrance and Phillip and the Land of the Goat People."" The camera pans an alien landscape, from a star in the sky to a pair of muscular men in spandex space suits] Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices."
1359,5,5,Phillip,"Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?"
1360,5,5,Terrance,"I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas."

1363,5,5,Phillip,"Wow, that sucks. [he and Terrance laugh. The dialog continues as the narrator speaks]"
1364,5,5,Narrator,"The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998, [a shot of them working on a script] the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called ""Not Without My Anus."" [a shot of the duo on the Metro, then the opening logo is shown, then shots of the episode itself] It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour [a shot of John singing], was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie [a clip of Terrance and Phillip on the Metro], they were enraged, bewildered, and scared. [a shot of the HBC building in flames] The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others. [a shot of the dead and wounded, another of rioting] The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish. [Terrance sits slumped over his sofa with a small can of polish at his feet] Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure [a shot of teen Terrance and Phillip superimposed on a burning HBC building], and it nearly killed them both."

It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer. [shots of the duo singing and dancing in the street, during ""Uncle Fucka""] And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 [shots of the war], in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success. [a shot of Terrance and Phillip holding an Oscar] After almost being executed by the American government [a shot of the attempted execution], Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada [they are shown getting off the plane, with the captain waving at them from behind], where they were touted as heroes. [a shot of Phillip looking at the video] They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through. [a shot of the duo being hoisted above the crowd, Terrance holding a golden cup.] And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow. [the audience cheers and claps.

1378,5,5,Terrance,"No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. [now dejected. Phillip farts long and soft.

Everywhere you go, people, crowds, [shot of people waiting to enter ""The Mine Shaft""] The rides are great, but... [a shot of crowds on Main Street] All the lines, lines, LINES! [shot of people waiting to enter a ghost ride, another shot of a kids' mine shaft ride; another of Cartman pissed off, eyes squeezed shut, with waiting times floating past him] If there's one thing I hate, [a shot of two lines of people entering his head] all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!! [opens his eyes, and a moment later...] And then there get to be so many people [his eyes roll around independently of each other] that they make FastPass. [a shot of people in a FastPass line] So then there's lines for FastPass. [zoom out to show Cartman in line for a FastPass] You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms [two lines for the Waterworks Restrooms], lines for the drinks [Astro Food line], lines for cantakuras [Seussian characters play strange instruments for the people in line] and rare Kartankulas Plinks! [a vendor sells them - they are a fruit treat shaped like strawberries] ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it."
1476,5,6,Mr Fun,"Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad. [signs the papers]"
1477,5,6,Chris the Investment Broker,"[the broker] Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. [slides the documents to Cartman]"
1478,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Gentlemen, I thank you."
1479,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle? [at the front of the synagogue, Kyle sits in the first pew right, and a shaft of moonlight shines down on him from the rose window over the altar. Stan approaches] Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?"
1480,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[not turning around, voice quivering] Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park."
1481,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--"
1482,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[leaves the pew to face Stan, teary-eyed] Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense! [to God] What is your logic?! [feels a pang in his ass] Ow. [tends to the pain]"
1483,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already."
1484,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[gleefully] Yyeessss! Yyeessss! [next, ""Java Jam!!"" a Teacup ride. Cartman laughs to himself] Awesome! [continues laughing. Next shot: Cartman in the ""Bumper Buggies"" bumper cars] Ho ho! [bumps into the car before him] Sweet! [bumps into the car behind him] Yes! [next shot: Cartman announcing at the Mine Shaft Ride] Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! [pulls the lever and the cars pull away. Cartman rushes to jump in the first car and buckles in. Outside, the cars go to one end of the ride] Yes! [the cars go to the other end of the ride] Yes! [next shot, goes to ""Ride Shots: pictures of your ride""] Oh, cool! [a picture of him on the ride appears on one screen] Oh, look how much fun I had! [next shot: a haunted ride. First, a mummy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheheheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Ah! Heheh. [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heh, heheh. [next shot, Cartman on a ferry around an island] Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome! [the island seems to have real animals there, like giraffes, elephants. Next shot, Cartman on a log ride, ""The Yeti."" He goes down the chute] Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess! [lands in the lake below] Yehess! [comes to the end of the ride, sobs joyfully] I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!"
1485,5,6,Stan Marsh,"[on the sofa] Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start."
1486,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,Great. [tosses the ring onto the sofa]
1487,5,6,Stan Marsh,What's that?
1488,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid. [hops onto the ring] Ow.
1489,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Heh, heh. [Kyle glares at him] Sorry."
1490,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!"
1491,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins."
1492,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hunh, I guess you're right."
1493,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[voice, from the TV] Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides [Cartman stands next to a Yeti. When the log car comes out, he jumps in and takes off], six roller coasters [one of them is shown], and tons of great surprises! [a haunted tree and the Yeti do their stuff. Cartman is back at the front gate] And the best part is: [zoom in] You can't come!! [Stan and Kyle look confused. Next shot: Cartman on Main Street] That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister [a shot of the fancy new ride, with Cartman in one of the cars, going through the loops], a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! [an overview of Adventure Island, with Cartman showing it off] It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!! [a shot of Cartman landing in a space capsule, with parachute] So come on down to Cartmanland now! [Cartman in the Haunted Mansion ride] But don't plan on getting past the parking lot, [back at the front gate] 'cause remember: [cue music] So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come! [cut music] Especially you, Stan and Kyle."
1494,5,6,Stan Marsh,"[hops off the sofa and heads for the door] That does it, dude!"
1495,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,Where are we going?
1496,5,6,Stan Marsh,We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! [Kyle hops off and takes his seat ring. Both boys leave]
1497,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[a mommy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Whoa! [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heheheheheh. [he exits the ride and ambles back to the road] Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh."
1498,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[in the distance, while Cartman speaks] Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts! [the sound of chain-link is heard] Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!"
1499,5,6,Eric Cartman,[lifts his hand to his ear to hear better] What the hell?
1500,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hohohooho! Oowwww!
1501,5,6,Eric Cartman,You sons of bitches! [goes towards the source of the sound]
1502,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude!"
1503,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!"
1504,5,6,Eric Cartman,[arriving] What the hell are you doing?!
1505,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Aw, crap."
1506,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, get me off of here!! [falls off, but outside the park]"
1507,5,6,Stan Marsh,Dude! [rushes out of the park to Kyle]
1508,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[now standing, rubbing his ass] Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!"
1509,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Alright, let's go."
1510,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[reaches the scene, but stays inside the park] That's right! You stay out!"
1511,5,6,Stan Marsh,"You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!"
1512,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,My life can't get any worse!
1513,5,6,Stan Marsh,You'll see! We'll get in! [walks off with Kyle as Cartman glares after them.]
1514,5,6,Eric Cartman,"...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!"
1515,5,6,Security Guard,So what does does this job pay?
1516,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them."
1517,5,6,Security Guard,"Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides."
1518,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[looks warily at the guard] But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line."
1519,5,6,Security Guard,I'm not interested.
1520,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines."
1521,5,6,Security Guard,"If you need security, I need a cash salary."
1522,5,6,Eric Cartman,But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
1523,5,6,Security Guard,"Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary."
1524,5,6,Eric Cartman,Ugh... Two people?
1525,5,6,Security Guard,This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.
1526,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park..."
1527,5,6,Security Guard,I will shoot on sight.
1528,5,6,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
1529,5,6,Doctor,You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you. [walks away]
1530,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,Lucky. [the operating room doors open and in walks Stan]
1531,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you."
1532,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, are you okay?"
1533,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?"
1534,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in."
1535,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
1536,5,6,Stan Marsh,Jesus.
1537,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude."
1538,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, don't say such things!"
1539,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?"
1540,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--"
1541,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God![Stan casts his eyes down] Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
1542,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[on the bullhorn] Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. [turns it off]"
1543,5,6,Kids,Aw.
1544,5,6,Boy,That's gay.
1545,5,6,Eric Cartman,"I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in."
1546,5,6,Butters Stotch,Hoh.
1547,5,6,Clyde Donovan,Oh. [Cartman moves a post and the two boys walk out. Cartman places the post back]
1548,5,6,Eric Cartman,The rest of you will just have to try another day.
1549,5,6,Kids,Aw. [they turn around and walk away. Cartman goes to the ticket booth and opens the window. Butters is waiting]
1550,5,6,Eric Cartman,"'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir. [Butters gives him the money and gets back change, his ticket, and a map of the park] Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland."
1551,5,6,Butters Stotch,"Hoh boy, oh boy! [Clyde purchases his ticket]"
1552,5,6,Eric Cartman,"...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. [Clyde leaves] Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides. [walks in and dances down Main Street] Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! [enters the ride and makes his way through the line] Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah- [finds Clyde and Butters waiting for the ride as well. They turn to see him] What are you doing?"
1553,5,6,Butters Stotch,We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
1554,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? [Clyde and Butters lean away from Cartman, a bit afraid]"
1555,5,6,Butters Stotch,"Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. [crosses his arms in disappointment]"
1556,5,6,Clyde Donovan,Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
1557,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, alright, alright, hang on. [pulls out a walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Security!"
1558,5,6,Security Guard,[arrives talking into his own walkie-talkie] What?
1559,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it."
1560,5,6,Security Guard,"Uh, I'm security, not maintenance."
1561,5,6,Eric Cartman,But I don't know how it works.
1562,5,6,Security Guard,Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.
1563,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person."
1564,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[on the bullhorn] Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day. [a shot of the crowd from the front, then one of Cartman] However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood? [everyone nods] Alright, let's go. [unhinges the velvet rope, and in walk Token, Timmy, Filmore and friend, Kenny, two adults, Bebe, and another boy]"
1565,5,6,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
1566,5,6,Eric Cartman,[eyes the new boy and stops him] Wait a minute! Who are you?
1567,5,6,Boy,Mike Gainor. [Cartman sees a bandage on the boy's face and rips it off]
1568,5,6,Eric Cartman,"HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!"
1569,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!"
1570,5,6,Eric Cartman,I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
1571,5,6,Stan Marsh,"It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!"
1572,5,6,Eric Cartman,Get him out of here! [Stan looks up in surprise]
1573,5,6,Security Guard,"Move along, sir. [sprays the pepper gas on Stan]"
1574,5,6,Stan Marsh,"AGGH! [The guard escorts him away] This isn't over, Cartman!"
1575,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides! [smiles and walks into the park. Next shot, Cartman in a roller coaster. Next, Cartman on ""Plummet from the Summit""] Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared! [reaches the top of the ride, then the car goes into free fall] AAAGGGHHH...."
1576,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,Agh! [the nurse moves the pincers one way] Agghh! [then another]
1577,5,6,Nurse,Just a little more. [one twist more] There we go. [withdraws the pincers. Gerald and Sheila enter Kyle's room with the Bible]
1578,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?"
1579,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,[the nurse leaves] Awesome. [Gerald and Sheila take their seats near Kyle]
1580,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible."
1581,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
1582,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle. [Kyle gets cross, and Gerald corrects himself] Uh, okay. [begins the story. A Middle Eastern scene appears] You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago. [camera pans across the landscape and rests behind a man in a red robe and long gray hair] Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children [they come out of a building with their mother], a wonderful wife, and many friends. [his friends show up to join the family behind Job, a proud and happy man]"
1583,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"[a shot of Job petting a bull] He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. [Job brings a bag of food to a woman with three kids next to her. One of them, a girl, walks up, and her mother hands her a loaf of bread]"
1584,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. [Job falls to his knees in praise, as his shepherds look on]"
1585,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God."
1586,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,[still mad] Satan talked to God?
1587,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, ""Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."""
1588,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"But Satan said, ""Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."""
1589,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"To which God said, ""Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."""
1590,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. [that scene is shown]"
1591,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. [meteorites rain down and destroy the fields and workers there, as well as the sheep]"
1592,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. [the palm trees bend low as the winds pick up, then the two-story house collapses as the palm trees are swept away by the winds, and Job's family dies]"
1593,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, ""The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away,"" and praised God's name. [Job falls to his knees and prays to God.]"
1594,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. [shown, with the burning fields behind him]"
1595,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. [another shot of Job among the dead, then a close-up of Job with his sores]"
1596,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"God said to Satan, ""See? I told you. Job still praises me."" [all that is heard after that is the sound of the heart monitor attached to Kyle.]"
1597,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,[a few seconds later] And that's it? That's the end?
1598,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,Basically.
1599,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
1600,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh. Uhhh, I don't know."
1601,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God."
1602,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[checking off items on a clipboard] ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day... [the clipboard reads, ""Cartmanland Expenses.""] Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... [under his breath] God-damnit! [picks up the bullhorn and says] Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! [the crowd hoots and hollers and surges forward, engulfing Cartman. The people rush towards the one open ticket booth]"
1603,5,6,Bijou Ticket Clerk,Welcome to Cartmanland.
1604,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Isn't he getting any better, doctor?"
1605,5,6,Doctor,"I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run. [leaves. The TV monitor is seen, with a picture of a financial program]"
1606,5,6,Announcer,"And now back to Money Quest, on HBC."
1607,5,6,Host 1,"[Camera zooms in on the two hosts] Welcome back to Money Quest. [Kyle looks at the show] In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman [his picture appears on the screen behind the hosts] has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands."
1608,5,6,Host 2,"And the way he did it is with the brilliant ""You Can't Come"" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing."
1609,5,6,Host 1,"Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country."
1610,5,6,Waitress,"I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now."
1611,5,6,Bijou Ticket Clerk,"No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in."
1612,5,6,Associate,[the shoppers rush out of there] Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's anymore! Get out of here! [kicks the last shopper out]
1613,5,6,Host 1,Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
1614,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... [passes out. A flatline appears on the heart monitor]
1615,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,[approaches] Kyle? Kyle? [turns to Gerald] Get the doctor!
1616,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[Bumped from ahead by car #9, Clyde] Eh! [Bumped from ahead by car #4, Kevin] Goddamnit, stop running into me! [at the Mine Shaft Ride he sits in the fist car, but is not enjoying it with all those other kids. Kenny is in the last car]"
1617,5,6,Kenny McCormick,"[around one bend] (Woohoo!) [around another] (Heeheehee!!) [he's out of his seat flying with the car, and he gets impaled in the face by a water pipe. It goes along for the ride. Outside, at Ride Shots, the shots from the just-completed ride are shown. Kenny is shown on screen 3 with the pipe buried into his face, which is now unrecognizable. On the steamboat ferry circling Adventure Island Cartman covers his ears and looks around angrily]"
1618,5,6,Eric Cartman,AGH! [he's next in The Yeti log ride with older kids] DAAGGHHHH!!
1619,5,6,Mr Fun,"My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!"
1620,5,6,Chris the Investment Broker,He sure did!
1621,5,6,Mr Fun,"Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!"
1622,5,6,Eric Cartman,"[approaches] Hey, there you are! [The two men see him]"
1623,5,6,Mr Fun,"Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success."
1624,5,6,Eric Cartman,Just give me my money back.
1625,5,6,Mr Fun,What?
1626,5,6,Eric Cartman,I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
1627,5,6,Mr Fun,...But it's doing great!
1628,5,6,Eric Cartman,"You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!"
1629,5,6,Mr Fun,[Chris smiles at this turn of events] You bet! I'll go get your money right now. [the men leave]
1630,5,6,Boy,"[walking along] Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?"
1631,5,6,Eric Cartman,"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! [scares the hell out of the boy. The father holds on to the boy]"
1632,5,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Isn't he responding at all, doctor?"
1633,5,6,Doctor,"[turns around to face them] I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life."
1634,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,But then... are you saying...?
1635,5,6,Doctor,There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.
1636,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"[walks up to Kyle] Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!"
1637,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! [three men in suits approach Cartman]"
1638,5,6,Agent,Excuse me? Eric Cartman?
1639,5,6,Eric Cartman,[turns to face them] Yeah?
1640,5,6,Agent,"I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy. [to the two other men] Seize the assets. [the men grab the discrepancy]"
1641,5,6,Eric Cartman,"He-hey, that's my money!"
1642,5,6,Mr Garrett,There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this. [takes the wagon with the other half million]
1643,5,6,Eric Cartman,What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
1644,5,6,Mr Garrett,"You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court. [the men walk away with the million]"
1645,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!"
1646,5,6,Mr Garrett,We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
1647,5,6,Eric Cartman,"No! But I don't... ah... ah... [sees Mr. Fun through a fence and rushes to talk to him] Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back."
1648,5,6,Mr Fun,"Nohoho way, José!"
1649,5,6,Eric Cartman,"But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!"
1650,5,6,Mr Fun,"""I don't care,"" said Pierre. ""I'm from France."" [turns around and disappears into the crowd]"
1651,5,6,Eric Cartman,This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
1652,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, you gotta see!! [the doctor looks at him. Sheila and Gerald turn around]"
1653,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"[sadly] Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! [weeps into Gerald's chest]"
1654,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?"
1655,5,6,Doctor,"Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I--"
1656,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Then damnit man, do it!"
1657,5,6,Eric Cartman,"It isn't fair! [throws another stone] You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! [throws another. Stan arrives with the doctor, the nurse, Kyle, and Kyle's parents]"
1658,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Look, Kyle. Look. [smiles]"
1659,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,[opens his eyes] Huh?
1660,5,6,Eric Cartman,"You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! [throws another stone]"
1661,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,[more alert] Huh?
1662,5,6,Eric Cartman,"I'M SO PISSED OFF! [the security guard arrives, ready to spray Cartman]"
1663,5,6,Security Guard,"Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!"
1664,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Ey! You used to work for me! [the guard sprays Cartman in the face] Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! [coughs and wheezes. Stan grins and Kyle's vital stats get stronger. Kyle sighs]"
1665,5,6,Stan Marsh,Kyle!
1666,5,6,Doctor,He's coming back.
1667,5,6,Sheila Broflovski,"That's it, baby. That's it."
1668,5,6,Eric Cartman,"Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!"
1669,5,6,Doctor,Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission!
1670,5,6,The Hemorrhoid,"[receding into the colon] Oh, shit!"
1671,5,6,Stan Marsh,"Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable. [a shot of Cartman on his knees, sobbing] Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it."
1672,5,6,Eric Cartman,"It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! [Kyle looks at Cartman, then up at the sky, then sits up and removes the oxygen mask]"
1673,5,6,Kyle Broflovski,You are up there! [smiles]
1674,5,7,Stan Marsh,"[voice only] ""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"""
1675,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[face appears] ""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."""
1676,5,7,Stan Marsh,"[face appears] ""That's what you said last time [pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket], but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures"" [moves the magnifying glass over the doll's body and fixes it there, focusing the sun's rays into a point]"
1677,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[fakes a cry] ""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"""
1678,5,7,Stan Marsh,"""Scream for me, bitch!"""
1679,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"""AAAAAAAH!"" [the doll's head begins to melt and shrivel, then Stan removes the magnifying glass]"
1680,5,7,Stan Marsh,Whoa! Awesome!
1681,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! Awesome!
1682,5,7,Eric Cartman,"[runs up excitedly] Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!"
1683,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, what now?"
1684,5,7,Eric Cartman,"No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! [goes away, and Stan and Kyle follow]"
1685,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"What's this all about, Kenny?"
1686,5,7,Kenny McCormick,(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
1687,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Watch this. It's sooo funny. [grins] Come 'ere, dog, come on. [giggles as he starts pleasing the dog] Good dog. [the dog rolls over on its back and Cartman starts stroking the dog's penis] Red rocket red rocket. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. Kenny starts to laugh and clap, and the dog's penis lengthens] Red rocket. Red rocket. [chuckles] Come on. [giggles]"
1688,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
1689,5,7,Eric Cartman,I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
1690,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,No they don't!
1691,5,7,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah they do!)
1692,5,7,Eric Cartman,"[continues milking] Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it. [concentrates on the dog] Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket! [the dogs ejaculates, and the semen lands on Cartman's face] Ohooohhh!"
1693,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, cool! [the dog quickly stands up and walks off]"
1694,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,That's awesome!
1695,5,7,Eric Cartman,I told you guys.
1696,5,7,Stan Marsh,I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
1697,5,7,Eric Cartman,"[sighs] Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away."
1698,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You ""beat off?"""
1699,5,7,Eric Cartman,[rolls his eyes up] That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off. [looks at Kenny] Don't you guys know anything?
1700,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?"
1701,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! [laughs as a gray dog approaches]"
1702,5,7,Sharon Marsh,I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
1703,5,7,Stan Marsh,[rushes in with Sparky] Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
1704,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?"
1705,5,7,Stan Marsh,But it's super-cool!
1706,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"Later, sweetie. [to the group] Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery."
1707,5,7,Man,Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.
1708,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"[Stan takes the dog and sets up near the table, away from the club circle] Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: [reads from ""Cannery Row."" Stan starts milking the dog]"
1709,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket."
1710,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"""Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"" [""Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.""] ""-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."" [The other adults lean in to see the action in the background. ""Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky.""] It's amazing how with three images [Mrs. Tweek covers her mouth as Mr. Tweek looks on, surprised] he puts you right there, and..."
1711,5,7,Stan Marsh,"[his parents turn at the sound of his voice] Red rocket, red rocket!"
1712,5,7,Randy Marsh,[recognizes the activity] WAAAH!
1713,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!"
1714,5,7,Stan Marsh,"I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. [the other adults turn away or show shocked looks]"
1715,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"[both parents now standing] STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!"
1716,5,7,Stan Marsh,My room? Why?
1717,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"Go, Stanley! [he walks off to his room. Sparky looks at the group, then gets up and follows Stan out, with penis still erect. Sharon turns around and says sheepishly] Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades."
1718,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?"
1719,5,7,Stan Marsh,No!
1720,5,7,Randy Marsh,"Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company! [Sharon glances at him] Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!"
1721,5,7,Stan Marsh,Why?! What's the big deal?!
1722,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??"
1723,5,7,Stan Marsh,"I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out."
1724,5,7,Randy Marsh,"No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual."
1725,5,7,Stan Marsh,Huh??
1726,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!"
1727,5,7,Randy Marsh,"Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out. [Stan looks confused] Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!"
1728,5,7,Stan Marsh,What things??
1729,5,7,Sharon Marsh,Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?
1730,5,7,Stan Marsh,No!
1731,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!"
1732,5,7,Randy Marsh,Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! [walks out the door. Sharon follows him out. Stan looks ahead blankly]
1733,5,7,Principal Victoria,"Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time."
1734,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"[stands] Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age."
1735,5,7,Principal Victoria,School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.
1736,5,7,Mr Tweek,It isn't soon enough.
1737,5,7,Stuart McCormick,"Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. [Randy and Sharon look at each other in recognition of the act]"
1738,5,7,Chef,"Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while."
1739,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex."
1740,5,7,Chef,The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
1741,5,7,Sheila Broflovski,"[rising] No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education. [sits, then rises again] From the school."
1742,5,7,Adults,"Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to."
1743,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like ""penis"" and ""vagina."" [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stifle some giggles] Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay. [turns and goes over to turn off the light, and turn on the projector with a remote control. Color cross-sections of male and female anatomies show up on the screen. Mackey jabs the screen with his pointer. The boys, especially Kyle, analyze the pictures. Mackey then points to the male anatomy] Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stifle some more giggles] STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral! [the boys stop quick] M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh... [slows his speech a bit] let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm."
1744,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?"
1745,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh... [turns around and starts again] I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??"
1746,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it."
1747,5,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited."
1748,5,7,Bebe Stevens,"Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!"
1749,5,7,Girls,Yeah!
1750,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we? [writes on the board] SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!! [the girls sit quietly] That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?"
1751,5,7,Wendy Testaburger,I didn't mean that-
1752,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, ""It's not going to happen to me."" You say, ""Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado."" WRONG! [the girls look chastened] Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences! [the girls are definitely afraid] You think that sex is about fun and games and love? [now with a folder in her left hand] Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes."
1753,5,7,Girls,AAAHHH!
1754,5,7,Ms Choksondik,And here's a little syphilis for you!
1755,5,7,Girls,AAAHHH!
1756,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!"
1757,5,7,Chef,"Hello there, children."
1758,5,7,Boys,Hey Chef.
1759,5,7,Chef,How is sexual education class going?
1760,5,7,Stan Marsh,It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
1761,5,7,Chef,"Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life."
1762,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?"
1763,5,7,Chef,"...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line."
1764,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
1765,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. [they approach the girls] Hey Wendy, did you guys get-"
1766,5,7,Girls,AAAAHHH! [hurry away from their table]
1767,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell is wrong with them? [the boys move towards the girls, who now have their backs against the far wall]"
1768,5,7,Stan Marsh,"You guys, we just wanna know-"
1769,5,7,Girls,AAAAHHH!
1770,5,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Stay away from me, Stan!"
1771,5,7,Stan Marsh,Why?
1772,5,7,Wendy Testaburger,Are you wearing a condom?
1773,5,7,Stan Marsh,...A what?
1774,5,7,Girls,AAAAHHH!
1775,5,7,Bebe Stevens,Do any of you have your condoms on?
1776,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,No.
1777,5,7,Girls,AAAAHHH!
1778,5,7,Wendy Testaburger,Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
1779,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Nuh uh.
1780,5,7,Bebe Stevens,"Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS."
1781,5,7,Eric Cartman,AIDS?
1782,5,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas."
1783,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Is that what you learned in sex ed?
1784,5,7,Eric Cartman,Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
1785,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything."
1786,5,7,Wendy Testaburger,"You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS."
1787,5,7,Stan Marsh,"[moves towards Wendy] But Wendy, we don't understand how that-"
1788,5,7,Girls,"AAAAHHH! [they throw their food up in the air and scatter, leaving the boys confused]"
1789,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, dude."
1790,5,7,Butters Stotch,"Uh what are we gonna do, huh?"
1791,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick."
1792,5,7,Boys,Yeah. [they set their meals down at nearby tables and walk away. Cartman returns for his meal and takes it with him]
1793,5,7,Pharmacist,Can I help you boys?
1794,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we need condoms!"
1795,5,7,Pharmacist,[looks at them funny] Condoms?
1796,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Quick!
1797,5,7,Pharmacist,How old are you boys?
1798,5,7,Stan Marsh,Why does that matter?
1799,5,7,Butters Stotch,Ha-I'll be nine next week.
1800,5,7,Pharmacist,"Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms."
1801,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
1802,5,7,Pharmacist,I just don't think kids your age should be-
1803,5,7,Mark the pharmacist and Assistant,"[intervening] Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them."
1804,5,7,Mark the pharmacist and Assistant,But... they're... children!
1805,5,7,Mark the pharmacist and Assistant,Would you rather them do it unprotected?
1806,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!"
1807,5,7,Mark the pharmacist and Assistant,I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
1808,5,7,Mark the pharmacist and Assistant,"Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected."
1809,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side."
1810,5,7,Mark the pharmacist and Assistant,I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
1811,5,7,Mark the pharmacist and Assistant,"Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty."
1812,5,7,Butters Stotch,"Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?"
1813,5,7,Mark the pharmacist and Assistant,"No, you have to change it."
1814,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things."
1815,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik."
1816,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway."
1817,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... ""missed"" anything."
1818,5,7,Ms Choksondik,[reaches for a book and opens it] Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.
1819,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Right! Oral sex, which of course would be..."
1820,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"[reading, then she looks at him] Using your mouth on the penis or vagina."
1821,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay."
1822,5,7,Ms Choksondik,It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.
1823,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, why d-uh, did you?"
1824,5,7,Ms Choksondik,Did I what?
1825,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers."
1826,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin. [thinks, then quickly adds] But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college. [rises and moves off some distance] I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses. [looks down at her rims] The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days."
1827,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Oh, I'm... I'm sorry."
1828,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand."
1829,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh, [softly] anyhow [normal] And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. [places the book on the side table]"
1830,5,7,Ms Choksondik,Your nickname?
1831,5,7,Mr Mackey,"""That guy with the really big head."""
1832,5,7,Ms Choksondik,...Right.
1833,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm."
1834,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me."
1835,5,7,Mr Mackey,Neither have I.
1836,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"[pause] Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?"
1837,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Uh not me! [they both giggle.] Huhuh, okay."
1838,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Well, back to the lesson plan, then."
1839,5,7,Mr Mackey,Right. [gets the book again]
1840,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Okay. [they both open their books] ""Oral Sex"""
1841,5,7,Stan Marsh,Doesn't it give any other directions?
1842,5,7,Butters Stotch,"Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener. [takes a condom out and gives the bag it Kyle] ""If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"""
1843,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, what are ""studzes"""
1844,5,7,Butters Stotch,"How the heck should I know? [removes the wrapper from the condom] Why, it's just a little doughnut. [squeezes it a little] Hoh- it's all gooey."
1845,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Just put it on, Butters."
1846,5,7,Butters Stotch,Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
1847,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?"
1848,5,7,Butters Stotch,"Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man. [turns his back to the camera and drops his pants, then slips the condom on] O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky."
1849,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
1850,5,7,Butters Stotch,"I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. [Cartman leans in for a better look]"
1851,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!"
1852,5,7,Eric Cartman,"I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!"
1853,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Sure.
1854,5,7,Butters Stotch,But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
1855,5,7,Tweek Tweak,"Ah, I got rubber bands. [pulls a few out and walks over to Butters. Butters takes one]"
1856,5,7,Butters Stotch,"[rubber band snaps in place] Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh. [snap] Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on."
1857,5,7,Stan Marsh,How do you feel?
1858,5,7,Butters Stotch,...Pretty good.
1859,5,7,Eric Cartman,Do you feel protected?
1860,5,7,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it."
1861,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Alright, here, everybody. [begins to move from his end to the other, visiting each of the boys] Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on."
1862,5,7,Timmy Burch,Timmehah!
1863,5,7,Principal Victoria,"Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use."
1864,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade."
1865,5,7,Principal Victoria,But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
1866,5,7,Ms Choksondik,...Kindergarten.
1867,5,7,Chef,Kindergarten?!
1868,5,7,Ms Choksondik,We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.
1869,5,7,Chef,"Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!"
1870,5,7,Mr Adler,I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
1871,5,7,Principal Victoria,I guess we have no choice.
1872,5,7,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is? [puts a box of Gladiator condoms on the table. The kindergartners look at him, and finally a girl raises her hand] Yes, Jenny?"
1873,5,7,Jenny,It flies around and it's endangered.
1874,5,7,Mr Garrison,"That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor. [holds up the box] Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs. [Filmore raises his hand] Yes, Filmore?"
1875,5,7,Filmore,Can we do fingerpaint?
1876,5,7,Mr Garrison,"NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom. [puts a phallus on the table] First of all you remove the condom from its package. [demonstrates] Then you find which way the condom rolls out. [demonstrates] Put it in your mouth... [puts it in his mouth] And apply. [proceeds to do so. The kids watch on astonished, and one of the boys finally cries. Mr. Garrison finishes and raises his head] And it's as simple as that. Any questions?"
1877,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all. [writes on the board] PREGNANCY! [turns around] That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?! [goes towards the door and wheels back a TV cart with VCR, and turns on the TV.]"
1878,5,7,"""The Miracle of Child Birth"" Narrator","[""The Miracle of Child Birth""] Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth. [shot of the girls watching] The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking."
1879,5,7,Girls,"Eeeeww. [as the narrator speaks, the girls get more and more shocked]"
1880,5,7,"""The Miracle of Child Birth"" Narrator","Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born. [Screen shot of baby being handled by the doctor is shown] but Mom's not done yet."
1881,5,7,Girl,Eeww.
1882,5,7,"""The Miracle of Child Birth"" Narrator",She still got some afterbirth to push out of her. [shot of afterbirth being pushed out]
1883,5,7,Girls,AAAAAAAA!!!! [they get out of their seats and rush out of the room]
1884,5,7,"""The Miracle of Child Birth"" Narrator",That's right.
1885,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"[follows the girl to the door] Girls! Girls! Where are you going?! [gets no answer, but she sees Mr. Mackey in front of her, in the hallway ending at her door, about to enter another door. She looks down and notices his butt, and just stands there...]"
1886,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Man, this condom's driving me crazy."
1887,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
1888,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. [takes a condom just filled with urine and tosses it at the trashcan. It hits the side and splatters the urine next to the can.]"
1889,5,7,Mr Mackey,"[enters with briefcase and books] Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay. [tosses the briefcase and books onto his desk and moves towards the light switch, grinning. He turns off the lights and starts the projector] M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening. [a picture of the female reproductive system. He points to the opening. Cartman works on a new condom] This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?"
1890,5,7,Eric Cartman,I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
1891,5,7,Mr Mackey,Why are you wearing a condom?
1892,5,7,Eric Cartman,So I don't get AIDS.
1893,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex."
1894,5,7,Stan Marsh,From sex??
1895,5,7,Mr Mackey,Yes.
1896,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You mean, intercourse with a girl?"
1897,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye."
1898,5,7,Stan Marsh,All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
1899,5,7,Eric Cartman,I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
1900,5,7,Mr Mackey,Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
1901,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!"
1902,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, come on guys, this is war! [leaves his seat and heads for the door. The other boys follow]"
1903,5,7,Boys,"[among their statements] Yeah! That's right! Come on!  [The last of the boys leaves, and Mr. Mackey doesn't notice. He begins to daydream. The generic female drawing turns into one of Ms. Choksondik, and he grins. He goes to the screen again, and moves his hand over the image]"
1904,5,7,Mr Mackey,"And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay."
1905,5,7,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?"
1906,5,7,Filmore,[raises his hand] Miss'nary position?
1907,5,7,Mr Garrison,"[turns around and writes the position] Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?"
1908,5,7,Girl,Doggie?
1909,5,7,Mr Garrison,"[turns around and writes the position] That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm."
1910,5,7,Boy,Pile driver?
1911,5,7,Mr Garrison,"[turns around and writes the position] Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid."
1912,5,7,Sally,The Filthy Sanchez?
1913,5,7,Mr Garrison,"[turns around and writes the position] Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez."
1914,5,7,Boy 2,Hot Karl?
1915,5,7,Mr Garrison,"[turns around and writes the position] Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure."
1916,5,7,Clyde,"There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. [the stronghold has a moat and reads: ""Boys Keep Out""]"
1917,5,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[at the helm of a gun turret] Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!"
1918,5,7,Bebe Stevens,Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
1919,5,7,Stan Marsh,Ha! They're your diseases!
1920,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! You get out of town!
1921,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Here, talk to them, Butters."
1922,5,7,Butters Stotch,"[lifts up his mask] Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?"
1923,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence."
1924,5,7,Butters Stotch,[lowers his mask and speaks into the mike. A deep raspy voice comes out] Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
1925,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Stan] Man, he's pretty good."
1926,5,7,Bebe Stevens,"We'll never walk away. Never! [tosses a boomerang towards the boys. Clyde ducks as the boomerang comes towards him, and Kenny is struck dead]"
1927,5,7,Kenny McCormick,(Waa-ooo!) [falls back and expires]
1928,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, bitch!"
1929,5,7,Stan Marsh,That does it! Attack! [the boys rush the stronghold]
1930,5,7,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay."
1931,5,7,Ms Choksondik,I've already gone through that with the girls. [closes her book and sets it down] It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?
1932,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Why, sure. [she goes to get drinks] Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm... [he gets a good look at her derriere] Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan."
1933,5,7,Ms Choksondik,[hands Mr. Mackey his drink] Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. [sits down]
1934,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples."
1935,5,7,Ms Choksondik,Or the... shaft... of the penis? [they look away from each other]
1936,5,7,Mr Mackey,"It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay."
1937,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the... [looks at him. They draw close to each other] clitoris of the woman."
1938,5,7,Mr Mackey,And these... are the two areas most important to-
1939,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Sexual stimulation. [they kiss quick, then kiss full and long. Some love music comes up. She pulls back] Oh, is this wrong?"
1940,5,7,Mr Mackey,"I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong. [they kiss full again] I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik."
1941,5,7,Ms Choksondik,Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?
1942,5,7,Mr Mackey,I go crazy.
1943,5,7,Ms Choksondik,Do you touch yourself?
1944,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Yeah. Hmm. [they embrace. She takes off his tie. He stands, walks some distance, and takes off his shirt. She stands, takes off her top, and tosses it away. She approaches him and removes his belt. He takes off his pants. She looks at him again and goes down to remove his briefs. She tosses them aside. He bends down to remove her underwear and tosses them aside. She coaxes him down, and he follows]"
1945,5,7,Ms Choksondik,[writhing] Haawww. Haawww.
1946,5,7,Mr Mackey,"G'oh, m'kay."
1947,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!"
1948,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Huh, what's wrong?"
1949,5,7,Ms Choksondik,It's your turn. [goes down to work on him]
1950,5,7,Mr Mackey,"Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. Okay! Okay!"
1951,5,7,Ms Choksondik,[gets up] Do you want me?
1952,5,7,Mr Mackey,I do.
1953,5,7,Ms Choksondik,Tell me.
1954,5,7,Mr Mackey,"I want you. M'kay. [they go down, then moments later quickly get up]"
1955,5,7,Ms Choksondik,Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?
1956,5,7,Mr Mackey,Well. No.
1957,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"[looks into his eyes and then] Oh well, fuck it [they go down, and the consummation begins] Oh God, give it to me! [his ass rises for the first time]"
1958,5,7,Mr Mackey,Oh yeah. Woh. [his ass appears again]
1959,5,7,Ms Choksondik,"Woh. [his ass appears again] Ooh, that's it baby! That's it!"
1960,5,7,Mr Mackey,"[his ass appears again] Aw, this feels so good, m'kay. [his ass appears again]"
1961,5,7,Boys,"WAAAAHHH!! [two boys prepare a Molotov cocktail, and one of them tosses it at the tires on the right side of the gate entrance. The tires go up in flames. The boys run away, and a huge flash explosion rises inside the stronghold]"
1962,5,7,Girls,"Waaaahh!! [they bail out immediately, and a much larger explosion rises, tossing kids away left and right]"
1963,5,7,Sharon Marsh,What the hell was that?
1964,5,7,Ms Choksondik,Did you feel something?
1965,5,7,Chef,"Oh, no!"
1966,5,7,Mr Garrison,"Jesus Christ. [a shot of the burning wreckage, then of Butters, Cartman, Stan, and Kyle looking at the wreckage]"
1967,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now."
1968,5,7,Sharon Marsh,"Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. [in the background paramedics pick up injured kids and put them in ambulances]"
1969,5,7,Stan Marsh,We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
1970,5,7,Ms Choksondik,I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.
1971,5,7,Kids,Oooohhh.
1972,5,7,Chef,"Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved."
1973,5,7,Parents,Huh?
1974,5,7,Chef,"Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know, [a shot of Mr. Mackey] someone who has a bad opinion of it, [a shot of Ms. Choksondik looking around] or even a complete pervert. [a shot of Mr. Garrison]"
1975,5,7,Mr Garrison,Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
1976,5,7,Ms Choksondik,He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.
1977,5,7,Sharon Marsh,This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
1978,5,7,Sheila Broflovski,"It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject."
1979,5,7,Principal Victoria,Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
1980,5,7,Kids,Hooray!
1981,5,7,Stan Marsh,"But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?"
1982,5,7,Chef,"It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17."
1983,5,7,Kyle Broflovski,Seventeen? [Sheila and Gerald approach]
1984,5,7,Chef,Seventeen.
1985,5,7,Sheila Broflovski,So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
1986,5,7,Chef,"Nope, just 17."
1987,5,7,Gerald Broflovski,"But, what if you're not ready at 17?"
1988,5,7,Chef,Seventeen! You're ready. [Stan walks up to Wendy]
1989,5,7,Stan Marsh,"Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?"
1990,5,7,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah. Thank God.
1991,5,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy! [a dog enters the scene, and the camera begins to zoom out. Everyone is smiling and looking on as Cartman pleases the dog] That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now."
1992,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,HA! I killed you!
1993,5,8,Stan Marsh,"HA, I blew your head off!"
1994,5,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Aw, Goddamnit!)"
1995,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?"
1996,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?"
1997,5,8,Eric Cartman,Let a man take a crap!
1998,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet."
1999,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing"
2000,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!"
2001,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[from behind the bathroom door] I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? [finishes wiping his butt and zips himself up. He comes out of the bathroom with something in his hands] You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper."
2002,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?"
2003,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody."
2004,5,8,Sharon Marsh,[walks in with a basket of laundry] Are you guys still playing that video game?
2005,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom."
2006,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[holds it up] Look. [Sharon gasps and drops the laundry. Cartman unravels it] But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. [looks through it]"
2007,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Eric, put that down!"
2008,5,8,Eric Cartman,Why?
2009,5,8,Sharon Marsh,Just go put it back in the trashcan!
2010,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[inspects it] Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive."
2011,5,8,Sharon Marsh,No that... that came from me; just put it away.
2012,5,8,Eric Cartman,This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! [hick accent] You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
2013,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[looks up at his mom] What is it, Mom?"
2014,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?"
2015,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing. [game play stops and the boys look at her] I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting."
2016,5,8,Stan Marsh,The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
2017,5,8,Sharon Marsh,Sure.
2018,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cool!
2019,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!"
2020,5,8,Stan Marsh,"There it is. The Okama GameSphere. [the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console]"
2021,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM."
2022,5,8,Stan Marsh,What's that?
2023,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't know, but it kicks ass. [they watch as Sharon buys the console from Mr. Harris and he wraps it up and delivers it to her] Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park."
2024,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. [the boys turn away from the window]"
2025,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. [checks his watch.] It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!"
2026,5,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
2027,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Awesome! [suddenly remembers] Oh, crap."
2028,5,8,Stan Marsh,What?
2029,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
2030,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we got GameSphere."
2031,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. [a strange character walks up next to them]"
2032,5,8,Towelie,"Don't forget to bring a towel. [it's a walking, talking towel]"
2033,5,8,Stan Marsh,What?
2034,5,8,Towelie,"When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, ""Don't forget to bring a towel."""
2035,5,8,Stan Marsh,...O-kay.
2036,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks, Towelie."
2037,5,8,Towelie,[after a few moments of silence] Do you wanna get high?
2038,5,8,Stan Marsh,"No. [Towelie looks for a few moments, then walks away]"
2039,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games."
2040,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere."
2041,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Here you go, boys. [Stan takes the shopping box and the boys take off]"
2042,5,8,Boys,AAAAAA.
2043,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, turn it on."
2044,5,8,TV,"""Okama GameSphere""!"
2045,5,8,Boys,Whoa!
2046,5,8,TV,[the game title comes up] Thirst For BLOOD!
2047,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it."
2048,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, this is so cool."
2049,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Bring it, bring it! [on the TV two monsters fight each other. The one on the right attacks the other with a chainsaw. ""Oh!""]"
2050,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late."
2051,5,8,Stan Marsh,"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere."
2052,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[slowly slides into a hick accent] Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih."
2053,5,8,Randy Marsh,What?
2054,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Nothing. Come on, Randy. [whisks him off to bed. From the TV: ""Twenty kills.""]"
2055,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- [to Cartman] wha-what is it?"
2056,5,8,Eric Cartman,Date-rape psychosis.
2057,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. [hangs up] I don't have to go outside!"
2058,5,8,Eric Cartman,Awesome!
2059,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight.."
2060,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!"
2061,5,8,Eric Cartman,We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
2062,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, it's alright. We can still play for [looks at his watch] six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball."
2063,5,8,Towelie,[walks in from nowhere] Don't forget to bring a towel.
2064,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Uh no.
2065,5,8,Towelie,"When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, ""Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."""
2066,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Okay, we will."
2067,5,8,Towelie,"[raises its arms in victory] Alright! [lowers them, then after some moments] Do you wanna get high?"
2068,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,No we don't wanna get high!
2069,5,8,Towelie,Okay... You sure?
2070,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! [Towelie goes away]"
2071,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!"
2072,5,8,Eric Cartman,That's... so... cool!
2073,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now."
2074,5,8,Stan Marsh,"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer."
2075,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school."
2076,5,8,Eric Cartman,It's Monday?
2077,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh, I'm sick."
2078,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
2079,5,8,Sharon Marsh,"No, you're not sick. Now get to school. [disconnects the console from the TV] All of you."
2080,5,8,Stan Marsh,But Mom...
2081,5,8,Sharon Marsh,Go!
2082,5,8,Boys,Aagh!
2083,5,8,Stan Marsh,Can't believe we have to go to school!
2084,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid."
2085,5,8,Stan Marsh,We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. [a green car pulls up in front of them. Two soldiers are in it]
2086,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Hello, boys, how are you?"
2087,5,8,Stan Marsh,Fine.
2088,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere."
2089,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,What? You mean Towelie? [the two soldier look alarmed. The passenger quickly gets on the radio]
2090,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at... [checks his map] Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado! [the men look at the boys]"
2091,5,8,Eric Cartman,"What, dude? [the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.]"
2092,5,8,Stan Marsh,This is gonna be one looong-ass day. [Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.]
2093,5,8,Stan Marsh,That was the longest day of school ever!
2094,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! [the boys burst in and head for the television]"
2095,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Where is it?
2096,5,8,Stan Marsh,It... it was right here.
2097,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Where the hell is it??
2098,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Come on, man, this isn't funny! [Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman look around and behind the TV] I need my fix! [the phone rings, and Stan goes to answer it.]"
2099,5,8,Stan Marsh,Hello?
2100,5,8,Voice,"If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel. [the boys gather to wait for Stan]"
2101,5,8,Stan Marsh,What? Who-who is this?
2102,5,8,Voice,"Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else! [in the background: ""Okama GameSphere!""]"
2103,5,8,Stan Marsh,Don't hurt it! [Click. Stan then hangs up]
2104,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,What? [Stan turns around]
2105,5,8,Stan Marsh,They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
2106,5,8,Eric Cartman,"[in disbelief, backs up.] No! ...No!"
2107,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh-uh-uh what do you mean ""they've taken it""? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!"
2108,5,8,Stan Marsh,Towelie!
2109,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, towel!"
2110,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Where the hell is he?
2111,5,8,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know. Where could it be?)
2112,5,8,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him."
2113,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
2114,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. [the others stop, and he calls out in one direction] Gebaayybeh! [then in another] Gebaayybeh!"
2115,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,That's a towel call?
2116,5,8,Stan Marsh,This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
2117,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water."
2118,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey yeah. [goes into the street and clears his throat] Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! [looks around. So do the others] Aaah. Let's go take a shower! [all look around] Let's go waterskiing!"
2119,5,8,Towelie,[walks up] Don't forget to bring a towel.
2120,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,There he is!
2121,5,8,Towelie,"Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. [Stan walks over angrily and takes Towelie's left hand, and pulls him along]."
2122,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude! [the others follow]"
2123,5,8,Towelie,Where are we goin'?
2124,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Just come on! It's getting dark.
2125,5,8,Towelie,Are we gonna get high?
2126,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Are you sure this is where they said to be?
2127,5,8,Stan Marsh,They said the gas station outside of town.
2128,5,8,Towelie,"Well, I'm gonna get a little high. [A high-powered light comes on]"
2129,5,8,Man,Hold it! [ten men stand in the light. Some of them wear red berets]
2130,5,8,Stan Marsh,Who is that? [squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same]
2131,5,8,Man,"Step... away... from the towel! [the boys do so, and an official steps forth]"
2132,5,8,Official,"There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you."
2133,5,8,Towelie,"If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel."
2134,5,8,Official,"It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you."
2135,5,8,Stan Marsh,"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games."
2136,5,8,Official,Your what?
2137,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!"
2138,5,8,Official,I don't know what you're talking about.
2139,5,8,Stan Marsh,You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
2140,5,8,Official,"Omigod! [shrieks] IT""S A TRAP!! [gunfire strikes him and kills him. Behind the boys soldiers pop up in the hills and continue firing]"
2141,5,8,Man 2,"Cover! Cover! [the officials and their personal security force fire back, and the light is knocked out]"
2142,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit, what now?!"
2143,5,8,Official,"Run, towel! [a grenade lands between two guards and blows up, shredding them to bits. The boys just look on]"
2144,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[disinterested] Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. [leads the others away]"
2145,5,8,Soldier 1,Where's the towel?!
2146,5,8,Soldier 2,"It can't be far! [two more soldiers come up, and others move along behind them] Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!"
2147,5,8,Guard,[coughs up blood. The boys arrive] Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
2148,5,8,Stan Marsh,[grabs the guard by the lapels and throttles him] Where is our Okama GameSphere?
2149,5,8,Guard,"Get the towel home [cough] They will explain everything. Please, hurry! [coughs up blood once more, and dies]"
2150,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, God-damnit!"
2151,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?"
2152,5,8,Towelie,"What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away."
2153,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. [they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements]"
2154,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Well?
2155,5,8,Soldier,"They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air."
2156,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. [gets pensive] They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
2157,5,8,Soldier 2,"Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T. [the commander looks at him annoyed, and he leaves]"
2158,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B."
2159,5,8,Soldier 3,You mean...?
2160,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Yes. [camera zooms in] Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. [fade to black]
2161,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Are we getting close?
2162,5,8,Towelie,I think so.
2163,5,8,Stan Marsh,"A little more gas, Kenny. [Kenny presses down on the gas pedal]"
2164,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,How long has it been since you've been back there.
2165,5,8,Towelie,"I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important."
2166,5,8,Eric Cartman,No it isn't.
2167,5,8,Towelie,Is!
2168,5,8,Eric Cartman,No it isn't.
2169,5,8,Towelie,"Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road."
2170,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Brake, Kenny, brake. [Kenny brakes, and Stan steers the truck to the right to go down the dirt road. Towelie moves to the window]"
2171,5,8,Eric Cartman,Egh!
2172,5,8,Towelie,M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
2173,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[sighs] Dude, don't you remember where it is?"
2174,5,8,Towelie,"I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high. [pulls out a joint...] then I'll remember where it is. [lights the joint and puffs deeply. The boys watch him as his eyes get bloodshot.]"
2175,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, so where is it?"
2176,5,8,Towelie,Where's what?
2177,5,8,Boys,Agh!
2178,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! [Towelie simply snorts]
2179,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! [Kenny brakes angrily and the truck jerks to a stop] Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!"
2180,5,8,Towelie,Well calm down.
2181,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,That's it! [takes the joint] You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
2182,5,8,Towelie,"That's my last joint, asshole!"
2183,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
2184,5,8,Towelie,"Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit."
2185,5,8,A Woman,"Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil. [some strange sounds are heard outside the door] Kevin, is that you?"
2186,5,8,Soldier,Harris! Reach bang and clear!
2187,5,8,A Woman,"Hello? [the bathroom door flies open and five soldiers pour in, firing away] WAAH! [she falls to the ground quick] Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod! [she covers her head]"
2188,5,8,Soldier,"Alright, it's clear! It's clear! [the soldiers leave the restroom. The woman gets up and checks herself for bullet wounds and finds none. She turns to see the wall behind her. The towels on their rack are shot through with holes. She blinks, confused]"
2189,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! [Mrs. Tweak leans out of the way, watching her towels get shot up.]"
2190,5,8,Soldier,Let's go let's go! [The soldiers finish their job and walk away. Mrs. Tweak straightens up]
2191,5,8,Soldier,Get it!
2192,5,8,Mr Garrison,What the? [two soldiers rush over and make him face the lockers. One of them pulls off his towel]
2193,5,8,Soldier,Throw it down! [the soldier throws it down]
2194,5,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! [the soldier stabs at the towel twice, then directs another soldier to fire away at it. The other soldier shoots at it while the other two watch]"
2195,5,8,Soldier,"Alright, let's go! [the soldiers leave]"
2196,5,8,Mr Garrison,Huh where are you goin'?
2197,5,8,Eric Cartman,This is where you came from?
2198,5,8,Towelie,"Yeah, I think so. [gets woozy] Oh man."
2199,5,8,Stan Marsh,What?
2200,5,8,Towelie,I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. [the group goes around the fountain and goes inside]
2201,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400."
2202,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?"
2203,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
2204,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth"
2205,5,8,Stan Marsh,We don't care.
2206,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly."
2207,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we don't care."
2208,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off."
2209,5,8,Stan Marsh,We... don't... care.
2210,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?"
2211,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop."
2212,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Who's they?
2213,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction."
2214,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[dismissive] Don't care, don't care, don't care."
2215,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again."
2216,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!"
2217,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at ""their"" base."
2218,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?"
2219,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),You mean to go right into their base? [thinks] Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.
2220,5,8,Soldier,"Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!"
2221,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Ah yes. [salutes back, and all three men lower their arms] Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?"
2222,5,8,Sgt Masters,Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
2223,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this. [the two sergeants look at each other]
2224,5,8,Sgt Boll,"Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles."
2225,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Hmm... [taps his pointer on the strategic map] So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!"
2226,5,8,Sgt Masters,Oo we...
2227,5,8,Sgt Boll,"He must have outsmarted us, sir."
2228,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
2229,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
2230,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
2231,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"[rolls up to Towelie] I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks."
2232,5,8,Towelie,That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
2233,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you."
2234,5,8,Stan Marsh,"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?"
2235,5,8,Guard,"Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?"
2236,5,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah. [the boys join Towelie and all go to jump from the helicopter]
2237,5,8,Guard,"Go go go go! [one after the other, the four boys and Towelie jump off, and then the helicopter leaves. Stan is the first to pull his parachute string, and the others follow. Soon they're all next to each other, floating down. Stan sighs]"
2238,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I figured it out."
2239,5,8,Stan Marsh,What?
2240,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!"
2241,5,8,Stan Marsh,"So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?"
2242,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Seven and a half.
2243,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[getting impatient] Hurry up, stupid parachute!"
2244,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I think we go over there. [the Secret Government Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching the gate]"
2245,5,8,Towelie,"[at the security entry pad] Let's see. [types in some numbers] No. [touches his lips with his right index finger, trying to figure out what to type next]"
2246,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks."
2247,5,8,Towelie,Hey it's been a long time!
2248,5,8,Eric Cartman,You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
2249,5,8,Towelie,"[faces Cartman] Don't preach to me, fatso!"
2250,5,8,Eric Cartman,"I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!"
2251,5,8,Towelie,You're stupid!
2252,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and you're a towel!"
2253,5,8,Towelie,"You're a towel! [Cartman has nothing more to say, and Towelie hops off the box towards the boys] Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high."
2254,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! [gives Towelie the joint] Here's your stupid lighter. [tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.]"
2255,5,8,Towelie,Hold on. [hops on the box and types into the entry pad again.] Wait a second [presses a few buttons] That's it!
2256,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,That's it?
2257,5,8,Towelie,"Yeah. That's the melody to ""Funky Town."" [starts playing the melody on the keypad] Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town."
2258,5,8,Stan Marsh,"No, Towelie, the entry code!"
2259,5,8,Towelie,[turns around] For what?
2260,5,8,Stan Marsh,"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence."
2261,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Well let's look in here. [opens the door and leads the others in. Before them are cylinders of liquids, each with a floating deformed clone of Towelie in it. They come across a Towelie clone drying under a heat lamp]"
2262,5,8,Towelie Clone,Kill... me... Kill... me.
2263,5,8,Towelie,Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
2264,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"[enters with four soldiers, who quickly get set to fire] Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in."
2265,5,8,Towelie,[turns around with the boys] What are these things?
2266,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid."
2267,5,8,Towelie Clone,Kill... me.
2268,5,8,Stan Marsh,Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
2269,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story."
2270,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh God, don't care, don't care."
2271,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"[pacing proudly, solemnly] Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. [the boys show no interest.]"
2272,5,8,Soldier,Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
2273,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,What terrifying secret?
2274,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
2275,5,8,Eric Cartman,"We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?"
2276,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. [his voice begins to deepen] Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know."
2277,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,And we don't care.
2278,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down."
2279,5,8,Stan Marsh,So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
2280,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Oh yes. It has been all along.
2281,5,8,Soldier,"Can I kill the towel now, sir?"
2282,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Go ahead. [the boys move away quickly]
2283,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"No, wait. [stays the weapon] Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. [zoom in on a tiny camera close to Towelie's lower border. Officials back at Tynacorp's command center are looking at the live feed] You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all."
2284,5,8,Stan Marsh,But we don't care!
2285,5,8,Official 1,What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
2286,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
2287,5,8,Official 2,We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
2288,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. [presses a button. A door with ""GS-401"" on it slowly spins around. A towel rack appears and a mean-looking buff towel hangs from it]"
2289,5,8,GS 4 1,[deep voice] Don't forget to bring a towel!
2290,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. [hands a disk to Stan] Then upload this encryption disk into their computers."
2291,5,8,Stan Marsh,We're just going in to get our video game back.
2292,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. [hands it to Kyle]"
2293,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Photon rifle, whatever. [the boys enter Tynacorp with Towelie.]"
2294,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Hello? Hello, anybody here? [GS-401 hops down from the rafters]"
2295,5,8,GS 4 1,"Welcome to the party, boys! [flexes and rushes Towelie] HAAARRRHHHH!! [the two towels wrestle a bit]"
2296,5,8,Towelie,Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
2297,5,8,GS 4 1,HAAARRRHHHH!! [Kyle fires the photon rifle and knocks the beefier towel away with the beam. The research team and security force pour into the room angrily]
2298,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?"
2299,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"[he and his troops pour in another door] Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! [the two forces face each other, with the boys and Towelie in the middle] Don't make a move, you bastards!"
2300,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children."
2301,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
2302,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!"
2303,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Ohmigod, look! [in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it]"
2304,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Our GameSphere! [the boys each get a controller and activate the GameSphere: ""Okama GameSphere""]"
2305,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. [behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play]"
2306,5,8,Tynacorp Research Leader (Zytar),"[turns to look at the boys] You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!"
2307,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!"
2308,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level."
2309,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Sweet!
2310,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,[now facing the research leader] But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar! [pulls at the research leader's head and the face comes off. Under it a green fish-alien head appears]
2311,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!"
2312,5,8,Zytar,Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
2313,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"[looks at the boys] And now you know the horrible truth, boys."
2314,5,8,Zytar,"Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! [fires a gun at the commander. Both sides begin to fire at each other and there are casualties on both sides. Zytar and two guards slowly back away and out of view]"
2315,5,8,Eric Cartman,Could you turn it up?
2316,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out! [the boys continue playing their game, so the commander comes up and reaches for the encryption disk in Stan's pocket, then goes away. Towelie sits on the floor with a huge bong, getting high. The commander reappears across the room moving towards a red button] I think I can get it from here, boys!"
2317,5,8,Zytar,[returns] What are you doing? You'll kill us all!
2318,5,8,Resistance Commander and Soldiers,"Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings. [inserts the disk and a huge explosion blows the boys out of the room.]"
2319,5,8,Boys,"Oooww! [Then it blows out the roof and some sides of the main building, and the boys find themselves hanging from Towelie, above a boiling tank of acid]"
2320,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Hup hup. Come on, hang on. [Stan and Kyle moan]"
2321,5,8,Stan Marsh,Whoa.
2322,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa.
2323,5,8,Kenny McCormick,(Help help! Heeelllppp!) [loses his grip on Kyle]
2324,5,8,Eric Cartman,Kenny!
2325,5,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Nooo!) [falls into the acid tank, disintegrating and sinking. Kyle looks on, but next to him is the GameSphere]"
2326,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[sees it] Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! [above him, Stan watches large pieces of metal fall to the ground]"
2327,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! [Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere]"
2328,5,8,GS 4 1,[walks in on an adjacent catwalk and sees Towelie with the boys hanging] What are you doing?
2329,5,8,Towelie,"Get away from me, you evil towel!"
2330,5,8,GS 4 1,"Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them."
2331,5,8,Towelie,No way! They're my friends!
2332,5,8,GS 4 1,"They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now."
2333,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,[swings closer] I've almost got it!
2334,5,8,GS 4 1,"You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. [holds out a joint. Towelie looks at it longingly] Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!"
2335,5,8,Stan Marsh,"[feels Towelie slip] Aw, crap!"
2336,5,8,GS 4 1,"You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high."
2337,5,8,Towelie,You asshole.
2338,5,8,Eric Cartman,"Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!"
2339,5,8,GS 4 1,"Come, Towelie! Make your decision!"
2340,5,8,Towelie,"I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! [Stan is shocked at the answer. Towelie stretches enough to take a puff while holding on to the boys, then slips enough for Kyle to succeed]"
2341,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,I got it! [grabs the GameSphere. Towelie pulls himself and the boys up to the catwalk in front of a door. An explosion behind GS-401 sends it into the air]
2342,5,8,GS 4 1,Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [floats down into the acid and disintegrates]
2343,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!"
2344,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Alright!
2345,5,8,Towelie,Alright!
2346,5,8,Eric Cartman,Hooray!
2347,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude, we finished level 50!"
2348,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Awesome!
2349,5,8,Towelie,"Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on."
2350,5,8,Kyle Broflovski,Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
2351,5,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level."
2352,5,8,Towelie,[heavily slurred] Don't forget to bring a towel. [the boys laugh]
2353,5,8,Eric Cartman,"You're the worst character ever, Towelie."
2354,5,8,Towelie,I know.
2355,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
2356,5,9,Eric Cartman,...Not really.
2357,5,9,Butters Stotch,"[runs up] Uh, hey! [The boys jump, startled] How's it goin', fellas?"
2358,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?"
2359,5,9,Butters Stotch,"Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?"
2360,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"These are gas masks, Butters!"
2361,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!"
2362,5,9,Butters Stotch,"What?! [frightened] Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?"
2363,5,9,Stan Marsh,There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
2364,5,9,Butters Stotch,Stop breathin'?
2365,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe."
2366,5,9,Butters Stotch,"Well. Alright, then. [takes in a big gulp of air and holds his breath hard. His head goes cock-eyed. A few seconds later, the bus pulls up. The kids on the bus and Ms. Crabtree wear gas masks as well. Officer Barbrady, wearing a gas mask, gets out of the bus to inspect the boys' backpacks. The boys, including Butters, line up before him, and he inspects Stan's backpack. He pokes at it in a few places and then gives it back to Stan. Butters begins turning blue]"
2367,5,9,Officer Barbrady,"Well okay. Next? [Stan boards the bus and Kyle steps up, giving his backpack to Barbrady. He inspects the backpack quickly and returns it to Kyle] Next? [Kyle boards the bus and Kenny steps up, giving his backpack to Barbrady. He inspects the backpack and pulls out some magazines...] Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers... [returns the magazines and backpack to Kenny, who quickly boards the bus. Cartman walks up.] Okay, next? [Cartman hands him the backpack and Barbrady quickly pulls out some scissors in it] A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!"
2368,5,9,Eric Cartman,Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
2369,5,9,Officer Barbrady,"These are a weapon! [holds the scissors aloft, away from Cartman]"
2370,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?"
2371,5,9,Officer Barbrady,I'll think of a way. Now move along!
2372,5,9,Eric Cartman,God-damnit! [boards the bus without his scissors]
2373,5,9,Officer Barbrady,"Alright, next! [No one steps up. Butters is quite blue now and just stands there. Then he just faints forward] Okay, clear. [the bus starts up, Barbrady boards it, and away it goes.]"
2374,5,9,Tweek Tweak,"[drops off his mask] Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me! [sits down] Oh Christ! [under his breath] they might - could get me."
2375,5,9,Ms Choksondik,"Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan. [holds up a sheet of paper with writing on it] So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in."
2376,5,9,Eric Cartman,HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
2377,5,9,Ms Choksondik,"Eric, the Afghan people need our help!"
2378,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!"
2379,5,9,Wendy Testaburger,"We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!"
2380,5,9,Eric Cartman,"That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents? [cue soft music. Cartman stands on his seat] Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids. [now standing on his desk] There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault."
2381,5,9,Wendy Testaburger,"The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!"
2382,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Yes, but they're sand monkeys!"
2383,5,9,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion!"
2384,5,9,Eric Cartman,"[drops into his seat angrily] God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!"
2385,5,9,Afghan Boys,"Awww!
[Afghan Kyle] .حالا پاشو بریم فیلم ببینیم ""Well, let's go watch a movie.""
then the four move off to their right. They pay for their tickets and head for the doors. A bomb falls on the theater and blows it up]Awww!
[Afghan Kyle] حالا چی کار می‌خوایم بکنیم؟ ""What do we do now?""
[Afghan Stan] پاشو بریم خونه‌ی ما بازی کنیم. کاری نمی‌تونیم بکنیم که. ببینین بچه‌ها، پدر و مادر من خونه هستن. خیلی متنفرم وقتی بمب می‌اندازن ""Let's go play at my house. There's nothing else we can do. See guys, my parents are home. I hate it when they drop bombs.""
[Afghan Kenny] حالا چی کار کنیم؟ ""What do we do now?"""
2386,5,9,Reporter,"[on TV] Another high-alert status for terrorists activity this weekend. [SNN - America Fights Back. A news ticker crawls by. Major headlines appear to the left, stock quotes on top, weather forecasts under the crawl] The government said ""bad things are likely to happen."" [the door bell rings] Meanwhile, the world continues to back down from their support of the United States [dingle] saying that they were really only kidding to begin with."
2387,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[approaching] Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'."
2388,5,9,Sharon Marsh,Can huh get th'ere 'or me? [Stan goes to open the door.]
2389,5,9,Randy Marsh,"[approaching through the kitchen, stops at the kitchen door] Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit? [Sharon mutters something] Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else? [the door closes] Shu-Shu-Sharon? [Stan comes back into view, pulling a box a bit bigger than he is into the living room]"
2390,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!"
2391,5,9,Sharon Marsh,"Weh, that's nahice."
2392,5,9,Stan Marsh,We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! [looks back at Randy] Do you have some scissors to get this open?
2393,5,9,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?"
2394,5,9,Stan Marsh,Well alright. [pushes the package back towards the front door. Randy returns to the kitchen... Sharon bolts from the sofa as Randy rushes back into the living room]
2395,5,9,Randy Marsh,Big brown package from Afghanistan??!!
2396,5,9,Sharon Marsh,Big brown package from Afghanistan??!!
2397,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaching] Dude, what's going on?"
2398,5,9,Stan Marsh,We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
2399,5,9,Hazmat man,"[in white] Prelims show negative, sir."
2400,5,9,Official,Then we're gonna have to blow it!
2401,5,9,Two SWAT men,[in gray] Yes sir!! [they leave and rig the box so it opens without much damage]
2402,5,9,Tweek Tweak,"AAHH! This is it, man! It's over!"
2403,5,9,Richard Tweak,"Tweek, calm down. Have some coffee. [Tweek looks up at Richard. The two SWAT members finish and return to the crowd. Everyone kneels behind the barriers and then cover their heads.]"
2404,5,9,Official,Open! [one of the SWAT officers presses the remote control and the box pops open. Inside is a goat]
2405,5,9,Goat,Mma-a-a-a-a-a-a. [people begin to look up at the goat]
2406,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, it's just a goat. [all rise]"
2407,5,9,People,Oohhh.
2408,5,9,Blond Man,"Look, it's a goat."
2409,5,9,Man 1,Awww.
2410,5,9,Brunet Man,A precious goat.
2411,5,9,Goat,Ba-a-a-a-a. [Stan approaches it as soft music plays]
2412,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[now next to the goat] Hey there, little guy."
2413,5,9,Official,[steps forward] Stay away from it! Terrorists could have given that goat anthrax or smallpox before sending it over! Johnson!! [another official steps forward and salutes] Check the goat for diseases!
2414,5,9,Johnson,"Yes sir! [walks over to the goat and begins licking its face. Stan backs away. After a few licks Johnson rises and announces] The goat seems to be clean, sir!"
2415,5,9,Stan Marsh,I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
2416,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off."
2417,5,9,Official,"Alright, men, this area is secure. Let's head out! [the various services disperse and drive away in their vehicles. ]"
2418,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well what are we supposed to do with it?
2419,5,9,Goat,Ba-a-a-a-a.
2420,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle."
2421,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster."
2422,5,9,Stan Marsh,Kenny?
2423,5,9,Kenny McCormick,"(No fuckin' way, dude!)"
2424,5,9,Stan Marsh,My parents will never let me keep a goat
2425,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it."
2426,5,9,Stan Marsh,"No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to [removes the return address from the box] take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. [takes the goat's reins and leads it away. The other boys follow]"
2427,5,9,Goat,Ba-a-a-a-a.
2428,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh oh, they're closing!"
2429,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?"
2430,5,9,Postman,Excuse me?
2431,5,9,Eric Cartman,"It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom."
2432,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
2433,5,9,Postman,"Afghanistan? [cautions] H-I'm sorry boys, but our planes aren't flying there."
2434,5,9,Stan Marsh,They're not.
2435,5,9,Goat,Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a.
2436,5,9,Postman,The only planes goin' to Afghanistan are the military planes over at the base. I'm sorry. [walks away]
2437,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. [leads the goat away. The others stand there for a second, then catch up to them]"
2438,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[calls out] Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us."
2439,5,9,Stan Marsh,I don't care! We're going!
2440,5,9,Towelie,[dropping in] Don't forget to bring a towel.
2441,5,9,The Boys,Aaagh!
2442,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh no, not Towelie."
2443,5,9,Towelie,"When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel."
2444,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Okay, thanks, Towelie. [rolls his eyes]"
2445,5,9,Towelie,Do you wanna get high?
2446,5,9,Eric Cartman,"[quickly] No, we don't wanna get high!!"
2447,5,9,Towelie,"You mean, you don't want Towelie around?"
2448,5,9,Eric Cartman,That's right!
2449,5,9,Towelie,So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... [snorts and starts laughing]
2450,5,9,The Boys,[not amused. Kyle covers his eyes] Awww!
2451,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!"
2452,5,9,Towelie,"Alright, see ya. [walks off]"
2453,5,9,General,"Alright, troops. We depart for Afghanistan in five minutes! Let's move out!"
2454,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[now in the base with the others] Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes."
2455,5,9,Soldier 1,"[off-screen] Isn't this exciting, Tony? [the boys hide behind some boxes nearby] We're finally gonna see some action."
2456,5,9,Tony,"[the soldiers, in desert fatigues, appear] Yeah, and uh, I hear that as soon as we land we get a USO show."
2457,5,9,Soldier 1,We do! [draws close] Stevie Nicks is goin' to perform.
2458,5,9,Tony,"Hoh, Stevie Nicks. Huh, I love her! [they move on]"
2459,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[peeks out] Okay, it's clear. Come on! [moves out with the goat and the other boys. A shadow falls across them]"
2460,5,9,Soldier,[off screen] Hey you!
2461,5,9,Tony,[aims his rifle at the boys] What the hell do you think you're doing here?!
2462,5,9,Goat,...Ba-a-a-a-a.
2463,5,9,Tony,"[chastened, quickly retracts the rifle] H-uh, I'm sorry, Miss Nicks, uh. [looks around] Hey guys, this is Stevie Nicks. [a black soldier walks up]"
2464,5,9,Soldier 2,Oh wow!
2465,5,9,Goat,...Ma-a-a-a-a.
2466,5,9,Soldier 3,"Uh, can I get a picture?"
2467,5,9,Soldier 4,"Miss Nicks. Over here, Miss Nicks! [takes a picture]"
2468,5,9,Goat,...Ma-a-a-a-a.
2469,5,9,Tony,"Oh... M- Miss Nicks, I... I don't wanna bother you, but... could you sing a quick Fleetwood Mac for us. Could ya?"
2470,5,9,Other Soldiers,"Oh yeah. Please. Come on, come on. Please. Yeah."
2471,5,9,Goat,...Ma-a-a-a-a. Ma-a-a-a-a.
2472,5,9,Soldiers,Oh! No way! That was wild! That was great!
2473,5,9,Soldier 3,Wait till I tell my sister about this; she is gonna flip!
2474,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys."
2475,5,9,Tony,"Oh, can we just get a-"
2476,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[turns right and walks off] Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions."
2477,5,9,Tony,"Oh, sure, we understand. Move along. [the soldiers watch the goat walk away with the boys]"
2478,5,9,Soldier 3,...She looks great.
2479,5,9,Tony,She looks great.
2480,5,9,Stan Marsh,"'K, let's put him on here. [walks up the ramp, pushing the goat along]"
2481,5,9,Goat,[inside the hold] Ma-a-a-a-a.
2482,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[enters and soothes the goat] Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours."
2483,5,9,Eric Cartman,"[he and the other two peek in] Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?"
2484,5,9,Pilot,"Alright, tango clear. [lifts the ramp up and swings it into the cargo hold...]"
2485,5,9,The Boys,Waaah!
2486,5,9,Pilot,Let's head out. [...then closes the door and walks to the cockpit. The boys drop into the hold]
2487,5,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and wrestles with the door] Aw, son of a bitch!"
2488,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[gets up, turns, and pounds at the door] Hey, wait! There are children in here!"
2489,5,9,Kenny McCormick,"[rises and moves a bit] (Oh, shit, we're locked in.)"
2490,5,9,Goat,[inside the hold] Ma-a-a-a-a.
2491,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan."
2492,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,[steps toward Stan] Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? [poot. Cartman blinks tightly and smiles]
2493,5,9,Boys,"Awww! [Kyle covers his nose, Kenny draws his hoodstring tight]"
2494,5,9,Kenny McCormick,(Ee-hew-hoo!)
2495,5,9,Eric Cartman,"[giggles] Uh ho, you guys."
2496,5,9,General,"Welcome to Afghanistan, troops! Get your gear ready and report to the barracks at o-nine hundred!"
2497,5,9,Soldiers,"Sir yes sir! [they march away. The pilot comes, opens up the small side door, and pulls down the ramp. The boys move out and go down the ramp with their jackets over their noses]"
2498,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, it was horrible!"
2499,5,9,Stan Marsh,Twenty hours!
2500,5,9,Kenny McCormick,"(God-damn, it stinks like shit!)"
2501,5,9,Goat,Ma-a-a-a-a! [leaps out and runs off]
2502,5,9,Pilot,What the hell?
2503,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
2504,5,9,Eric Cartman,It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
2505,5,9,Pilot,[leans in and sniffs] I don't smell any- boh! Oh God! [begins choking] Hohhgh! [looks away] Blagh! [convulses] Bleeaagghh [throws up twice and passes out]
2506,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Uh, whatever!"
2507,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You sonofabitch, Cartman! [begins to walk away, passing Cartman] You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! [Stan passes by]"
2508,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!"
2509,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[finds the goat next to Kenny] Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home! [pulls out the return address] We have to find this address. [leads the goat off. The other boys follow]"
2510,5,9,Goat,Ma-a-a-a-a.
2511,5,9,Eric Cartman,"God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!"
2512,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!"
2513,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey look! There's a taxi! [horse-drawn, with small back tires. The boys head for it, passing a street performer.]"
2514,5,9,Performer,[raises his hands] Haa-aa-aa. [the boys into the taxi's back seat]
2515,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[to the driver] Hello. We need to go... [hands the driver the address] here. [the driver says: شما می‌خواین برین خونه؟ ""You guys wanna go home?"" and whips the horse into action. The taxi moves off]"
2516,5,9,Eric Cartman,What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
2517,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Is this the right house?
2518,5,9,Stan Marsh,I think so. [steps up and knocks on the door]
2519,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","[approaches and opens the door] شما چیزی می‌فروشید؟ ""You guys selling something?"""
2520,5,9,Stan Marsh,"A-ah, hi. We're from America. [Akmarh simply looks back] Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?"
2521,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh",Goat? [the other Afghan boys show up behind Akmarh]
2522,5,9,Goat,Ma-a-a-a-a.
2523,5,9,Stan Marsh,Here. Wu-we don't want it.
2524,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","Oh, you want something else? All we had was the goat. Your country bombed everything else."
2525,5,9,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat."
2526,5,9,Eric Cartman,"It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. [the Afghan boys are insulted]"
2527,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh uh, and here. [pulls out a small flag] Take this American flag as... a gift. [hands it to Akmarh and backs up. Akmarh considers the gift for a few moments, then throws it on the ground and steps back. The fat kid moves up and pours some fuel on it, then the poor kid strikes a match and throws it on the fuel, setting the flag on fire.]"
2528,5,9,Afghan Boys,Yaaay. [they jump up and down]
2529,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
2530,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America."
2531,5,9,Fat Boy,Huh! !آمریکایی‌ها با خوک می‌خوابن Americans are pig fuckers!
2532,5,9,Eric Cartman,What did you call us?!
2533,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh",Your country is the evil empire! Your government wants to rule the world! But your values and your spirituality are in the guh-ter!
2534,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Then why did you send us the goat?
2535,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Because, in Afghanistan, we have pride. If you send us something, we must send something in return."
2536,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","It doesn't mean we don't still hate you. Now, get out of here! [the Afghan boys back up and Akmarh shuts the door]"
2537,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey! Hey, open the door!"
2538,5,9,Eric Cartman,I told you! Jawas have no heart.
2539,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Jawas?
2540,5,9,Eric Cartman,"You know, sand people."
2541,5,9,Stan Marsh,How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
2542,5,9,Goat,Ma-a-a-a-a.
2543,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!"
2544,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Alright. [leads the others away. The goat follows. Stan hears the hoofbeats and stops] Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad."
2545,5,9,Eric Cartman,"[softly] God, I hate you so much, Stan!"
2546,5,9,Stan Marsh,"What? [voices rise in the distance (مرگ بر آمریکا! مرگ بر آمریکا ""Down with USA"" or ""Death to America""! The boys look on. The protesters march by the boys and stop, curious about the boys standing there. Stan greets them] Howdy. [the protesters remain motionless]"
2547,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Um... [looks around, then slowly] Greetings from Canada. [now with Canadian accent] Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?"
2548,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Ey, what the hell are you talking about?! [Stan and Kyle look at Cartman angrily] I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!"
2549,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[buries his face in his hand in disgust and shakes it] Cartman, you stupid asshole! [the crowd roars with anger and ties the four boys and the goat up. Two of the protesters talk about what to do next. One of them ends with]"
2550,5,9,Protester,...Osama bin Laden! [the others crack up and lead the captives away]
2551,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Good job, fatass!"
2552,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, don't call me a Canadian! [the protesters lead the captives up a mountain road. A bird in a tree warbles an Arabic song. When the lead protester reaches the tree he shoots the bird, and the bird falls down and away, dead. The trek resumes]"
2553,5,9,Stan Marsh,You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! [one of the guards says something]
2554,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-"
2555,5,9,Voice,"Amaar madmallah [the guards look up, then line up at either side of the cave entrance. A lanky figure walks in]"
2556,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"[swaying as he walks in] Oooo, alamalamalamalaah."
2557,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh crap, it's him!"
2558,5,9,Goat,Ma-a-a-a-a.
2559,5,9,Osama bin Laden,[pacing before the boys] Amalama hamahamahama? [draws close to Cartman] Una Haqa mala
2560,5,9,Eric Cartman,"[leaning away] Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive."
2561,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Haqaama hamahalahamahaqa. [the guards move off and return with studio equipment - two spot lights and television camera. The cameraman announces that they're ready to tape (!اوساما خان، حاضره ""Osama sir, we're ready."". Osama sways over to his spot. The cameraman gives a signal and several makeup artists rush in for some quick touch-ups, then leave. The cameraman gets behind the camera and gives the signal to start talking] U bataqataqaa maladala. Ameriqa la tabakabaka haka haqadaqadaqa [laughs] Haqahaqa, daaqadaqa!"
2562,5,9,Cameraman,"Aaaaand... cut! [Osama grins and the guards clap. Osama takes a small bow and tosses the mic away, then walks off]"
2563,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, these people are insane."
2564,5,9,SNN reporter,"...as more and more case of terrorist-related AIDS continues to grow. And this just in: the Taliban has apparently taken American civilians as hostages. The Taliban has just released this videotape [the boys and the goat in their chairs, flanked by two Taliban guards], in which it is clearly visible that they have indeed captured [closeup of the goat, with Kenny to the left] Stevie Nicks. Miss Nicks appears to be in good spirits, though her whereabouts are unknown."
2565,5,9,Randy Marsh,"[pops in from the kitchen] Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?"
2566,5,9,Sharon Marsh,[raises her head a bit] Yes. I just saw him.
2567,5,9,Randy Marsh,Oh okay. [slowly moves back into the kitchen]
2568,5,9,SNN Reporter,"With Stevie Nicks in captivity, the other members of Fleetwood Mac have been hidden so the Taliban can't get to them as well. [the soldiers are crestfallen]"
2569,5,9,Tony,They... took Stevie Nicks?
2570,5,9,Soldier 2,"Bastards! Heartless, gutless bastards!"
2571,5,9,General,Alright men! Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks back!
2572,5,9,Soldiers,[cheering] Hooray!!! [some of them have their arms raised]
2573,5,9,SNN Reporter,"The Taliban's video also shows what appears to be four American children in captivity, though they could just be French."
2574,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh",[rising] We have to help them.
2575,5,9,Fat Boy,Do you say??
2576,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh",They are not espies. They came to give us our goat back.
2577,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,Screw them! They are evil Americans!
2578,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","I know! But if we don't help the innocent ones, then we are no better than the Americans are."
2579,5,9,Fat Boy,Help the Americans? That doesn't make sense.
2580,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","Dude, we are espeaking English right now. Does that make sense??"
2581,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Alright, let's go. [they pick up their rifles and exit]"
2582,5,9,Fat Boy,"!ای لعنت ""Oh, goddammit!"""
2583,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Aw, jihad, jihad. [the boys look at each other for reactions, and the alarms go off] Oh? [walks over to his security screen and sees the Americans converging outside the cave entrance, then runs around unsure what to do] Oh, oh! Ameriqa haqa haqa! Dursha! Dapadapadapa! [the guards respond and give each other orders while moving out. Osama pulls out a walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Hulagugla hugagugahagahaa!"
2584,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Qubada durqaana Ameriqanab! Qubada durqaana- [a grill next to the boys rises, and the Afghan boys climb out]"
2585,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
2586,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,Shh. We've come to save you.
2587,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,But I thought you hate us.
2588,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"We do. [Osama talks away, and the boys slip out quietly with the goat. Cartman decides not to join them, and walks towards Osama]"
2589,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, where are you going??"
2590,5,9,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
2591,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, he's crazy!"
2592,5,9,Eric Cartman,"He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. [walks off]"
2593,5,9,Osama bin Laden,A flippity flappity floop! Jihad jihad!
2594,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Mehah... [bites on some food] What's up, bin Laden?"
2595,5,9,Osama bin Laden,Arrrrrrrrrrrubadubaduba! Durbadurba haq!
2596,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray. [quickly rushes for a prayer rug and rolls it out, then kneels and bows deeply a few times.] Allah, Allah, m'heh"
2597,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Taba haqa?? [goes for his prayer rug and does as Cartman does] Allah Allah Allah, Allah hakadurrpa durpa adurpa hagalah [Cartman brings out a huge mallet and smashes it on Osama's head. Osama's head rings like a bell, then he looks at Cartman and aims his rifle at him]"
2598,5,9,Eric Cartman,Uh oh! Mmm-mm! [kisses Osama and tumbles away]
2599,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh",We will have to be quick! The Americans are attacking!
2600,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where do we go? [they look around]
2601,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","Get down! [all boys hit the floor and hide their faces. A bomb blows up in front of them. When the smoke clears, Kenny and the poor Afghan boy are both dead, both riddled with bullets]"
2602,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"!اوه الله! کشتن کیوانو ""Oh, my God! They killed Keyvan!"""
2603,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","!تو، دیوث ""You bastards!"" [Stan and Kyle look at each other. Akmarh gets his rifle and fires away at American helicopters] You... murdering Americaaans!!"
2604,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war."
2605,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","America DID eh-start this war! They eh-started it YEARS ago, when they put their military bases on Muslim holy lands!"
2606,5,9,Osama bin Laden,[tossing the bush away] Ramadan!
2607,5,9,Eric Cartman,Hey look! An infidel! [bin Laden quickly turns around]
2608,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Wuut? Peitoqaba! [Cartman gets up and pulls bin Laden's pants down. Osama looks stunned. A magnifying glass pops up over bin Laden's genitals, then another, then another... nine in all, and the penis is finally visible. A sign pops up... ""Tiny, ain't it?"" A few seconds later the sign and magnifiers go down and Osama pulls his pants up]"
2609,5,9,Eric Cartman,So that's what this is all about?
2610,5,9,Osama bin Laden,Ishta fatwa open sesame!
2611,5,9,Eric Cartman,[climbs up bin Laden and kisses him] Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!
2612,5,9,Osama bin Laden,Proila foqabam!
2613,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Woohoo! [zips away, leaving a dust cloud front of bin Laden. Bin Laden gives chase, leaving his own dust cloud.]"
2614,5,9,General,"We're coming, Miss Nicks! Hang on!"
2615,5,9,Goat,Ma-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a!
2616,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America."
2617,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,And you believe it? It is not just the Taliban that hates America. Over a third of the world hates America!
2618,5,9,Stan Marsh,But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
2619,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Because, you don't realize that a third of the world hates you!!!"
2620,5,9,Stan Marsh,[considers the argument...] ...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
2621,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh",You're butt-holes!
2622,5,9,Stan Marsh,You're buttholes!
2623,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're buttholes!
2624,5,9,Female voice,Youhoo.
2625,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Haduqaduqaduqa. [Osama's tongue has rolled out to the floor. He tugs it and it rolls up like a classroom projection screen] Huqadukadukadukaduuu. [Osama whistles and then lustily howls like a wolf as he stomps his foot down on the ground. Cartman hops off the camel, walks some distance, and bats his eyes at bin Laden. Osama takes big steps towards Cartman, and the camera alternates between the two. Bin Laden stops short of Cartman... and leaps over him, landing on the camel's neck. Bin Laden starts kissing the camel all over, and Cartman removes his veil, looks at bin Laden, then looks at the camera]"
2626,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"[on bended knee] Oh bella, bella falafel. [brings out a bouquet of flowers]Mi amore. Fatwa, fatwa. [Cartman holds up a sign with a screw and a baseball on it, then puts it away. Bin Laden hops away, then returns with a table, two chairs, two glasses and some wine, and sets up a table for two. He sets the camel down on one chair and sits on the other one opposite the camel. He then serves up some glasses of wine]Ahh, de vino! Mi fatwa! J'ai une fatwa! [Cartman holds up four other signs: a jack and donkey, a pile of feces and a bald head, a rooster and lollipop, and Barbra Streisand]"
2627,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!"
2628,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,It's better than a civilization that spends its time watching millionaires walk down the red carpet at the Emmys!
2629,5,9,Stan Marsh,"...He's got us there, dude. [pan out to see more fighting]"
2630,5,9,Tony,"[finds the goat and picks it up] I got her. I got Stevie Nicks. [carries it away. The Americans retreat, but continue firing away]"
2631,5,9,Goat,Me-e-e-eh.
2632,5,9,Eric Cartman,There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! [hauls bin Laden away.]
2633,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"Oh, dapidiuta ako. [Bin laden manages a wave good-bye at the camel.]"
2634,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Hur-ry, get into wardrobe! [bin Laden goes behind the walll and changes clothes. Cartman taps his foot impatiently] Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?! [bin Laden comes out dressed as Uncle Sam] Oh, you look marvelous, dahling."
2635,5,9,Osama bin Laden,Haqa hamahama.
2636,5,9,Eric Cartman,"Come on! The cameras are ready! [pulls bin Laden to his mark. Behind them, eight Taliban soldiers fire away at the Americans] Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras. [walks off and returns with a director's megaphone and a firecracker] Oh, and here's your microphone. [hands Osama the firecracker]"
2637,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"[the Taliban soldiers see Uncle Sam and approach him] Ogh. America adirqadirqa- [looks around. The soldiers fire away at him. Bin Laden staggers, then looks at the object in his hand. Other Taliban soldiers rush in to see, and they all recognize whom they just shot.] Uh ohhh."
2638,5,9,Osama and the Taliban Soldiers,"HAAAAAAGH! [the firecracker explodes, killing all the soldiers around it. Only Osama is left there at the point of impact, sitting on the ground, with his teeth dangling like piano keys. They play a few notes]"
2639,5,9,General,We've done it! The Taliban is destroyed!
2640,5,9,Soldiers,Hoorayyy!!
2641,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
2642,5,9,Osama bin Laden,"[flaps his lips with his finger, making some noise] Terrorists is the craziest peoples. Eheeee! [shows his teeth. An American soldier walks up behind bin Laden and dispatches him with one last shot]"
2643,5,9,Soldier,I got him! I got him!
2644,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,"Well, it looks like the Taliban and bin Laden are finally out of power."
2645,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh","Yeup, you don't need us anymore. [they turn and walk away]"
2646,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing. [the Afghan boys turn around] Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all."
2647,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
2648,5,9,Boy in Blue Vest,That's fine. But we still hate you. [the Afghan boys turn and walk away again]
2649,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too."
2650,5,9,"The Four Afghan Boys
 Akmarh",[the Afghan boys look again] Maybe. In time. [they turn once again and walk off]
2651,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm confused.
2652,5,9,General,"Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies!"
2653,5,9,Soldier 5,[cheering] Hooray!
2654,5,9,Soldier 6,"Hooray! Yeah, we sure did!"
2655,5,9,General,"The world is now safe, thanks to you. And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks!"
2656,5,9,Soldiers,"Whoa. Yeah. [the goat, dressed to look like Stevie Nicks, approaches the mic.]"
2657,5,9,Fleetwood Mac,"Just like the wild winged bird sings a song-Stand back, she's singin'."
2658,5,9,Goat,Maaa
2659,5,9,Fleetwood Mac,Baby
2660,5,9,Goat,Maaa
2661,5,9,Fleetwood Mac,Babe
2662,5,9,Goat,Maa-ha [the concert continues. The three boys watch the performance.]
2663,5,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go get to the plane. [turns left and walks away. The others follow. On the way there, Stan sees a flag on the ground and approaches it. He goes down on one knee, picks up the little flag, blows the dust off it, sets it into the ground, takes off his jacket, and wraps it around the base of the flag ]"
2664,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,[approaching with Cartman] Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
2665,5,9,Stan Marsh,"No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium."
2666,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
2667,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[rises, steps back, and salutes] Go America."
2668,5,9,Kyle Broflovski,[salutes] Go America. [lowers his right arm] Go Broncos. [moves off]
2669,5,9,Stan Marsh,"[follows] Yeah, go Broncos."
2670,5,9,Eric Cartman,Yeah. [follows the other two out]
2671,5,10,School Photographer,"Okay, now lift your chin a little. [no change on Stan's face] Look right here. Right here. [points at the camera lens] Hey, where's my smile? Come on, I bet you got a smile for me. I-I'm startin' to see a smile. [Stan doesn't smile] There it is. [FLASH!] Okay great, next."
2672,5,10,Stan Marsh,[reaches for his hat and puts it on] I didn't smile. [hops off the stool and walks away. A wider view shows Ms. Choksondik's class in line off to the right. The kids move forward. Butters heads for the stool]
2673,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
2674,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[in dress shirt and tie, holds out his palms] Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. [pulls out a comb and some gel, dabs the gel on the comb, and combs his hair back. Four strokes, and he's done]"
2675,5,10,School Photographer,"Okay, smile [Butters smiles, a lock of his hair goes up, and he blinks. Then the picture is taken, and Butters opens his eyes] Okay, next? [Butters hops off; Bebe, wearing heavy makeup, approaches and hops onto the stool]"
2676,5,10,Stan Marsh,[joins Kyle at the end of the line] Did you go yet?
2677,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,No. This is taking forever.
2678,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up, giddily breathless] You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!"
2679,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What, Cartman?"
2680,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! [points]. Kenny, Kenny, over here! [Kenny comes in looking as Cartman described, with his hands on the floor and his feet in the air, laughing uncontrollably. After Kenny stands still, Cartman roars with laughter]"
2681,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It isn't that funny, Cartman."
2682,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes it is! [while this is going on, the other kids get their pictures taken, Token being the last one. He hops off the stool and walks away.]"
2683,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! [Kyle walks up to the stool]"
2684,5,10,Eric Cartman,"...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny."
2685,5,10,School Photographer,"[Kyle sits for the camera] Take off your hat, please."
2686,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,But I never take off my hat.
2687,5,10,School Photographer,"Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural."
2688,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,This is how I look natural.
2689,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!"
2690,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[angrily] Crap. [takes off his hat to reveal big red bushy hair]
2691,5,10,School Photographer,"Smile! Come on, where's that smile? Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see a smile. [Kyle gives a small grin, and the picture is taken. He goes back to being angry, re-dons his hat and hops off the stool] Next!"
2692,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Gay-ass. [Cartman hops on, takes off his hat and quickly strikes a pose]"
2693,5,10,School Photographer,"[takes the picture] Very nice. Okay, last one? [hops off laughing as Kenny approaches]"
2694,5,10,Eric Cartman,Uh oh. [laughs]
2695,5,10,School Photographer,"Okay, have a seat, young man. [both Cartman and Kenny chuckle as Kenny sets himself down] Well, okay, lookin' great. Now where's that smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide smile. Wider. Perfect! [FLASH!]"
2696,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?"
2697,5,10,School Photographer,Should be about four days.
2698,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!"
2699,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!"
2700,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-"
2701,5,10,Eric Cartman,[bouncing in his seat] YES! YES!
2702,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures [Kenny looks around], and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!"
2703,5,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Aww, that's bullshit!)"
2704,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! [thrusts the photo out for a close-up]"
2705,5,10,Butters Stotch,Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
2706,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely."
2707,5,10,Butters Stotch,"But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! [the others get their photos and review them]"
2708,5,10,Eric Cartman,[rushes up and takes Kenny's photos] Let me see! [returns to his seat. Stan and Kyle look at Cartman curiously while Kenny looks on angrily]
2709,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[catches up to Ms. Choksondik as she sits at her chair] Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!"
2710,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[opens Kenny's envelope and looks at the photo, then roars with laughter] Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!"
2711,5,10,Kenny McCormick,(You've ever done?!)
2712,5,10,Eric Cartman,[Laughs] Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! [laughs some more]
2713,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!"
2714,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!"
2715,5,10,Ms Choksondik,"You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!"
2716,5,10,Eric Cartman,I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
2717,5,10,Butters Stotch,I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
2718,5,10,Ms Choksondik,Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. [points towards the door]
2719,5,10,Butters Stotch,"My mom? [turns around and walks out] Oh, sweet Jesus!"
2720,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny. [Kenny looks over] I just had the greatest idea... ever!"
2721,5,10,Receptionist,Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?
2722,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? [stifles a laugh]"
2723,5,10,Receptionist,"Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?"
2724,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes, I have it right hmya. [shows her Kenny's school photo]"
2725,5,10,Receptionist,"[takes the photo] O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately."
2726,5,10,Eric Cartman,"You will? [tries not to laugh, but some escapes] Ah. [stifles another laugh] Oh, ah, thank you for your help."
2727,5,10,Receptionist,Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? [Cartman stops in his tracks and turns around]
2728,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye. [sniggers, then laughs] Brown eye! [laughs some more under his breath]"
2729,5,10,Receptionist,"Okay, brown eye..."
2730,5,10,Eric Cartman,"And, and big rosy cheeks! [laughs some more]"
2731,5,10,Receptionist,...Full cheeks...
2732,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[cracks up] Full cheeks! [laughs] Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! [cracks up]"
2733,5,10,Reporter,"Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next? [Stan and Kyle are on the sofa eating popcorn. The phone rings, and Kyle answers it]"
2734,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hello?
2735,5,10,Eric Cartman,[between the laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! [laughs uncontrollably]
2736,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hello?
2737,5,10,Eric Cartman,[more laughter] ...You guys!... [more laughter]
2738,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[getting annoyed] Cartman?
2739,5,10,Eric Cartman,[more laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. [hangs up]
2740,5,10,Stan Marsh,What's he want?
2741,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[pissed off] I don't know. Let's go see. [they walk off]
2742,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Why'd you call us?
2743,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Come on. Come on. [whispers] Come on.[leads the way] Oho, this is so sweet! [still laughing as he walks to the sofa and picks up a milk carton] You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!"
2744,5,10,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit Cartman, what?! [Cartman hands him the carton and erupts in laughter as Stan and Kyle look it over]"
2745,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
2746,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! [falls to the floor, pounding the carpet with his fists in hysterics]"
2747,5,10,Stan Marsh,"That isn't funny, Cartman."
2748,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!"
2749,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children."
2750,5,10,Eric Cartman,"No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys."
2751,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[gasps] Oh my God. Oh my God! [holds the carton close. Her face looks like a derriere] Steven! Steven, come quick!"
2752,5,10,Steven Thompson,"[rushes in. His face does also.] What is it, Martha?"
2753,5,10,Martha Thompson,Look. It's him! It's... our son.
2754,5,10,Steven Thompson,Our ssson!
2755,5,10,Martha Thompson,...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.
2756,5,10,Receptionist,"[stunned] ... yes, I see. [pics up a milk carton carton] Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found."
2757,5,10,Steven Thompson,"We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition."
2758,5,10,Receptionist,...Riiight.
2759,5,10,Steven Thompson,"You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be."
2760,5,10,Receptionist,[flatly] ...Really?
2761,5,10,Steven Thompson,Yes.
2762,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Steven and I have a condition called ""torsonic polarity syndrome."" It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically."
2763,5,10,Steven Thompson,Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.
2764,5,10,Receptionist,"[flatly] Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing."
2765,5,10,Steven Thompson,Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.
2766,5,10,Receptionist,So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?
2767,5,10,Steven Thompson,"No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages..."
2768,5,10,Receptionist,"Well, Mr. and Mrs..."
2769,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Uh, Thompssson."
2770,5,10,Receptionist,"...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together."
2771,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!"
2772,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?"
2773,5,10,Martha Thompson,You're right. You're right.
2774,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?"
2775,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[gets up and hops off the sofa] Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God. [tries to compose himself] Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right? [wipes some moisture from his face] And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. [cracks up again]"
2776,5,10,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son."
2777,5,10,Eric Cartman,"No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! [waits a second, then roars with laughter again]"
2778,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,...Nuh uh.
2779,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!! [roars with laughter again. The doorbell rings and all three look at the door] Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh. [walks over to answer the door. He stops and stifle a laugh] Just- okay [chuckles] No. [takes a few steps] Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. [steps to the door, takes a deep breath, and opens it, grinning]"
2780,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[greeting] Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. [Cartman stands there grinning, then it disappears into a frown. A few moments later he turns around dejected.]"
2781,5,10,Eric Cartman,Oh God.
2782,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[starts laughing, but stifles it with his hands over his mouth] Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!"
2783,5,10,Stan Marsh,"No way! [Cartman turns around and looks again, frowning]"
2784,5,10,Steven Thompson,"We understand you've seen our son. [Cartman looks speechless, then turns around looking lost]"
2785,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[very softly] Oh my... God. [walks away from the door quite afraid, then begins to ascend the stairs stammering nonsense]"
2786,5,10,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, where are you going?? [Cartman keeps walking. The Thompsons simply shrug their shoulders, looking at each other]"
2787,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[holds up the milk carton] Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?"
2788,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[giggles a bit] Uh
2789,5,10,Stan Marsh,Oh boy.
2790,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house."
2791,5,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
2792,5,10,Martha Thompson,[Steven puts his arm around her shoulder] Oh thank you. Thank you! [they turn and walk away. The receptionist waits for them on the walkway]
2793,5,10,Receptionist,Well?
2794,5,10,Steven Thompson,They said to inquire four houses down.
2795,5,10,Martha Thompson,Let's hurry! [leads the way down the street. Steven and the receptionist follow]
2796,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
2797,5,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you missed them turning around."
2798,5,10,Eric Cartman,"You guys, something's wrong."
2799,5,10,Stan Marsh,What?
2800,5,10,Eric Cartman,I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
2801,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,[quizzically] Blew a funny fuse?
2802,5,10,Eric Cartman,[turns to face them] It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded. [turns away] I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
2803,5,10,Clyde,You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
2804,5,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's."
2805,5,10,Token Black,How do they eat?
2806,5,10,Stan Marsh,How the hell should we know? [the kids stop before a house]
2807,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
2808,5,10,Butters Stotch,[opens his bedroom window and looks down] W-what?
2809,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
2810,5,10,Stan Marsh,There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
2811,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture."
2812,5,10,Stan Marsh,"But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!"
2813,5,10,Linda Stotch,"Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!"
2814,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened."
2815,5,10,Linda Stotch,You made a goofy face!
2816,5,10,Butters Stotch,No! That's just what I look like. See?
2817,5,10,Linda Stotch,"[turns around and looks up] ...Don't you make that face at me, young man!"
2818,5,10,Butters Stotch,"I'm not makin' a face, mom!"
2819,5,10,Linda Stotch,Stop it!
2820,5,10,Craig,"...Come on, we wanna see the ass people."
2821,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Alright. [the kids turn left and walk away]
2822,5,10,Linda Stotch,"Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! [goes inside and shuts the door.]"
2823,5,10,Butters Stotch,Another week? [turns around and drops down] I hate my stupid face.
2824,5,10,Mr Mackey,"Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?"
2825,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?"
2826,5,10,Mr Mackey,"Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny."
2827,5,10,Eric Cartman,Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
2828,5,10,Mr Mackey,"Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?"
2829,5,10,Eric Cartman,"You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh."
2830,5,10,Mr Mackey,"Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things."
2831,5,10,Eric Cartman,[turns over to look at Mr. Mackey] So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
2832,5,10,Mr Mackey,"It's possible, hm'kay? [Cartman turns over and lays on his back again] But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, ""Friends"" [laughs at the unexpected humor in his own statement]. Ohokahay, huhuh."
2833,5,10,Eric Cartman,Ugh.
2834,5,10,Mrs McCormick,"...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton."
2835,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Yes. Yes, I see."
2836,5,10,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? [Kenny just stares at them]"
2837,5,10,Martha Thompson,"...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up."
2838,5,10,Steven Thompson,"It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be."
2839,5,10,Stuart and Mrs McCormick,Really?
2840,5,10,Receptionist,"Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?"
2841,5,10,Steven Thompson,Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.
2842,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[leans into Steven's right shoulder, sobbing, and he comforts her] Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again. [sobs uncontrollably]"
2843,5,10,Mrs McCormick,"[rises to soother her also] There there now. [looks around, then walks off]"
2844,5,10,Receptionist,"Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright. [Martha continues sobbing] Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time. [Mrs. McCormick returns with a box of tissues. Martha takes one and blows her ""nose"" with it. Mr. McCormick walks off again, and Martha resumes sobbing] We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!"
2845,5,10,Mrs McCormick,"[holds her arms out as if to keep Martha away] Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!"
2846,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[blows her nose again and sobs some more, then tries to compose herself] Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [blows her nose]"
2847,5,10,Receptionist,"Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?"
2848,5,10,Steven Thompson,Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.
2849,5,10,Martha Thompson,The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why. [Stan and Token are now looking in through the window. Kyle joins them. Martha blows her nose] We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own. [a couple of hands try to get a grip on the window sill]
2850,5,10,Receptionist,And this was back in Wisconsin? [Craig soon rises into view outside]
2851,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west. [Token, Craig, and Kyle start laughing. Tweek pops up and pushes Craig out of the way to have a good look. Stan laughs, and Craig climbs up on Tweek.] That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense."
2852,5,10,Martha Thompson,"We've tried every avenue to find him, [Officer Barbrady happens by and says something. The kids jump] but, we've never tried the milk company. [Stan seems to tell Barbrady to come over and look at the ass people.]"
2853,5,10,Receptionist,"Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk [Barbrady approaches] is not only the best resource for finding kids, [Barbrady's eyes widen] but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. [Barbrady walks away and calls out to some people, then returns to the window]"
2854,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us. [Mr. Garrison walks by and looks in, then seems to say ""Holy crap!""]"
2855,5,10,Steven Thompson,This certainly is a friendly town. [Sheila shows up behind Kyle] You've all been sssssso wonderful. [Chef shows up behind Mr. Garrison]
2856,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again."
2857,5,10,Stuart and wife,[they hold their palms out] NO!
2858,5,10,and Receptionist,[they hold their palms out] NO!
2859,5,10,Male 1,"Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties? [the audience laughs; Cartman sits there, glum, his head resting on his left hand.]"
2860,5,10,Male 2,"I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash. [the audience laughs; Cartman just blinks.] Look, can we just get this over with?"
2861,5,10,Male 1,"But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa! [the audience laughs]"
2862,5,10,Male 2,"Come on, dude."
2863,5,10,Male 1,"Oh, alright  Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa."
2864,5,10,Audience,Aww
2865,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[out of sorts] Oh, dude, oh."
2866,5,10,Jonesy,"[noticing] Dude, what's wrong with you?"
2867,5,10,Eric Cartman,Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
2868,5,10,Male 1,"Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing. [Cartman fakes a laugh and the audience turns to look at him. Cartman manages a few weak laughs, then sinks in his seat]"
2869,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons."
2870,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Please, please. It's not your fault."
2871,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room. [stops] As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible. [commercial music comes up] That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself."
2872,5,10,Martha Thompson,Amazing.
2873,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"[a worker comes by with some food] Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones. [the Thompsons take some milk and scones and start eating]"
2874,5,10,Steven Thompson,Delicious.
2875,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition. [the couple set their milks back on the tray and the worker walks out.]"
2876,5,10,Steven Thompson,Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
2877,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center. [leads them into a large darkened room]
2878,5,10,Martha Thompson,"Oh my, isn't this impressive?"
2879,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases."
2880,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"[the receptionist] We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?"
2881,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time."
2882,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,Alright then. Computer...
2883,5,10,Computer,Workiiing.
2884,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.
2885,5,10,Computer,TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.
2886,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?
2887,5,10,Martha Thompson,That's right.
2888,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?"
2889,5,10,Steven Thompson,"Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo, [takes a bite out of the scone and chews it] we assumed someone had seen him since we did."
2890,5,10,Martha Thompson,"[pulls out a baby picture] This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy. [in diapers in a crib, looking like he's just finished eating]"
2891,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.
2892,5,10,South Park Milk Company President,"Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili. [walks out. The Thompsons follow him]"
2893,5,10,Steven Thompson,We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.
2894,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much."
2895,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! [goes inside, and Jimmy follows, closing the door]"
2896,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,What's this all about?
2897,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor."
2898,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much."
2899,5,10,Eric Cartman,I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
2900,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine."
2901,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let me have it."
2902,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
2903,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay, why?"
2904,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. [Cartman doesn't respond]"
2905,5,10,Eric Cartman,"...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing."
2906,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock."
2907,5,10,Eric Cartman,Who's there?
2908,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,Orange.
2909,5,10,Eric Cartman,Orange who?
2910,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
2911,5,10,Eric Cartman,"[stares back] ...naw, that didn't work either."
2912,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock."
2913,5,10,Eric Cartman,Who's there?
2914,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,An interrupting ca'ow.
2915,5,10,Eric Cartman,An interrupting cow who
2916,5,10,Jimmy Valmer,[interrupting] Moooooo! [...no response.] ...What a terrific audience. [the two of them stand in the middle of the living room looking at each other]
2917,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?"
2918,5,10,Computer,Workiiing.
2919,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity."
2920,5,10,Computer,Workiiing. [some computer noises] Negative.
2921,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?"
2922,5,10,Computer,Workiiing.
2923,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing.
2924,5,10,Computer,Workiiing. [some computer noises] One million six thousand hits.
2925,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years."
2926,5,10,Computer,Workiiing. [some computer noises] Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits.
2927,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk."
2928,5,10,Computer,"In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks."
2929,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,"Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S."
2930,5,10,Computer,"Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match"
2931,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,Bingo. Do you have a photo
2932,5,10,Computer,"Printiiing. [the screen reads ""Processing"". A picture starts appearing on screen]"
2933,5,10,Mrs Garthunk,My God. Oh my God!
2934,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! Hey Butters!
2935,5,10,Butters Stotch,[opens his windows; has a paper bag over his head] Hehyeah?
2936,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!"
2937,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems."
2938,5,10,Stan Marsh,Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
2939,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to [raises his hand high] here with me."
2940,5,10,Stephen Stotch,Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?
2941,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[hops down to the floor] I sure am, Dad!"
2942,5,10,Stephen Stotch,"Alright, you can take the paper bag off."
2943,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[removes the bag] Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-"
2944,5,10,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!"
2945,5,10,Butters Stotch,"Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-"
2946,5,10,Stephen Stotch,Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!
2947,5,10,Butters Stotch,I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-
2948,5,10,Stephen Stotch,Put that bag back on!
2949,5,10,Butters Stotch,"[subdued] Yes, sir. [slips the bag over his head again]"
2950,5,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that poor kid. [walks off]"
2951,5,10,Clyde,"Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. [turns with the other boys and follows Kyle off. Butters slams his windows shut]"
2952,5,10,Eric Cartman,"Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school."
2953,5,10,Eric Cartman,And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
2954,5,11,Mr Garrison,"Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight! [sees a guard] E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?"
2955,5,11,Airport Security Guard,Uh I don't know nothin'.
2956,5,11,Mr Garrison,"But you work for the- [the guard turns around and walks way] uh, God-damnit!!"
2957,5,11,Voice,[over the PA system] Snooty Airlines announces the arrival of flight 239 from Connecticut.
2958,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us."
2959,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),What's he look like?
2960,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,He's your age and about your height.
2961,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. [Ike flashes an angry look]
2962,5,11,Ike Broflovski,I todd a nurra.
2963,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, there he is. [waving] Over here, Kyle! [a boy wearing a NY cap and a #34 shirt appears. Kyle grins and holds up the sign. The boy looks to his right and walks off. Another boy appears, with bushy hair and a part down the middle and thick glasses]"
2964,5,11,Kyle Schwartz (Kyle),"Hello, Aunt Sheila."
2965,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,How was your flight? [Kyle lowers the sign and looks stunned]
2966,5,11,Kyle Schwartz (Kyle),"Oh, it was terrible. They recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't. [walks up and joins the family]"
2967,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,You remember Uncle Gerry.
2968,5,11,Kyle Schwartz (Kyle),"Hi, Uncle Gerry."
2969,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"[kneels on one knee] And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle."
2970,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Hey dude.
2971,5,11,Kyle Schwartz (Kyle),It's nice to meet you.
2972,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. [rises and moves]"
2973,5,11,Both Kyles,Okay:
2974,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"[returns and genuflects again] Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you [to the nephew] Kyle, and you can be Kyle... [to the son] Two! [holds up two fingers and walks off. Kyle Schwartz (Kyle) follows her while Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two) sorts this out]"
2975,5,11,Kyle Two,Cool. [follows the others out]
2976,5,11,Clerk,[female] Next?
2977,5,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. [hands her his ticket]"
2978,5,11,Clerk,"[starts typing away] Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it."
2979,5,11,Mr Garrison,"What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more!"
2980,5,11,Clerk,"Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning."
2981,5,11,Mr Garrison,"I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!"
2982,5,11,Clerk,[ignoring comments] Would you like a window or an aisle seat?
2983,5,11,Mr Garrison,"This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, ""We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-""!"
2984,5,11,Clerk,"Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?"
2985,5,11,Mr Garrison,[people in the lines hear him and turn to look] Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!
2986,5,11,Man,"Hey, he's right!"
2987,5,11,People,YEAH!
2988,5,11,Clerk,"Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?"
2989,5,11,Mr Garrison,"So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion dollar salaries!"
2990,5,11,People,YEAH!
2991,5,11,Clerk,[prints out a pass and hands it out for Garrison to get] And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.
2992,5,11,Mr Garrison,"You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!"
2993,5,11,People,YEAH! ALRIGHT! GO!
2994,5,11,Mr Garrison,"You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!! [turns and stretches his arms over the crowd] Come on, everybody!"
2995,5,11,People,YEAH!
2996,5,11,Man,"[next in line, approaches the clerk] Can I get on that 7:30 a.m. flight?"
2997,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Here we go, Kyle Two. [Kyle Two smiles at the soup he's gotten] And here's yours, Kyle. [Kyle inspects it]"
2998,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"[sniffs] Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?"
2999,5,11,Kyle Two,Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.
3000,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Oh is, is this beef?"
3001,5,11,Kyle Two,"Yeah, dude, it's great! [eats the soup with gusto]"
3002,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass."
3003,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?"
3004,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-"
3005,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
3006,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble."
3007,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,[rises and heads for the kitchen] I'll put it in the microwave right away. [heavy breathing is heard. Kyle Two looks at his cousin]
3008,5,11,Kyle Two,Mom?
3009,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, Kyle Two?"
3010,5,11,Kyle Two,How am I related to him again?
3011,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already."
3012,5,11,Kyle Two,"Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?"
3013,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
3014,5,11,Kyle Two,So we have the same blood?
3015,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school."
3016,5,11,Kyle Two,What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
3017,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,I'm sure your friends will love him.
3018,5,11,Kyle Two,"What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!"
3019,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle Two, he's your responsibility."
3020,5,11,Kyle Two,Oh my God.
3021,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
3022,5,11,Kyle Two,Well what do you mean? [she catches her breath] What room is he sleeping in?
3023,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?"
3024,5,11,Kyle Two,"I don't know, dude."
3025,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?"
3026,5,11,Kyle Two,I don't think so.
3027,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on."
3028,5,11,Kyle Two,"Okay. [reaches for the light and turns it off, then tries to sleep. That distinctive breathing returns as Kyle slowly goes to sleep, and Kyle Two takes a peek. Kyle swallows and turns his head to the left. Kyle Two looks at him, annoyed, then turns his back on Kyle and tries to sleep again]"
3029,5,11,Mr Garrison,"Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!"
3030,5,11,Mr Hat,What was wrong with that plan?
3031,5,11,Mr Garrison,"It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit! [tries something new] Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?"
3032,5,11,Mr Hat,"Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around."
3033,5,11,Enrique Iglesias,"[on TV, gyrating his hips around, holding his crotch in his left hand, the back of his head with the right one] ...I think about you day and night. I think about you..."
3034,5,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?"
3035,5,11,Mr Hat,I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!
3036,5,11,Mr Garrison,That's it. Gyration. [pulls something onto his desk] A gyroscope. [sets it in motion] It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius! [starts writing again] It's so simple and yet genius!
3037,5,11,Mr Hat,"Check out his hot bulge, too."
3038,5,11,Stan Marsh,Hey dude.
3039,5,11,Eric Cartman,What's that thing?
3040,5,11,Kyle Two,"Cartman, I need to talk to you. [takes him off to one side]"
3041,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"[to Stan] Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle."
3042,5,11,Kyle Two,"Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal."
3043,5,11,Eric Cartman,What?
3044,5,11,Kyle Two,"That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him."
3045,5,11,Eric Cartman,Forty bucks?
3046,5,11,Kyle Two,"But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'."
3047,5,11,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright."
3048,5,11,Kyle Two,And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
3049,5,11,Eric Cartman,"Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?"
3050,5,11,Kyle Two,"Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? [Cartman looks past Kyle Two and sees Kyle talking away at the bus stop]"
3051,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),I can't believe how cold it is out here.
3052,5,11,Eric Cartman,[pulls back and mulls his chances] Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
3053,5,11,Kyle Two,Alright. [both return to the bus stop]
3054,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
3055,5,11,Kyle Two,"[formal introductions] Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish."
3056,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"[goes over to greet Cartman] Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?"
3057,5,11,Eric Cartman,"[weakening] ...Oh, man."
3058,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),[observes this and gets angry] Cartman?!
3059,5,11,Eric Cartman,"[snaps into action] Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. [at that moment, a large wheel zips by the bus stop, and the kids cover their eyes]"
3060,5,11,Stan Marsh,What the hell was that?
3061,5,11,Officer Barbrady,Uh what the hell was that?
3062,5,11,Stuart McCormick,What the hell was that?
3063,5,11,Randy Marsh,"I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it. [looks at Stuart] But I want one."
3064,5,11,Stuart McCormick,"Yep, me too."
3065,5,11,Mr Garrison,"We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone! [Mr. Hat doesn't move] Well what are you waiting for?!"
3066,5,11,Ms Choksondik,"And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student. [To Kyle] Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?"
3067,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family. [Kyle Two buries his face in his hands] I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are."
3068,5,11,Eric Cartman,"[resisting an urge] Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it."
3069,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker."
3070,5,11,Eric Cartman,[resisting mightily] I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
3071,5,11,Ms Choksondik,"Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle? [Kyle goes to the desks, looks around, then runs around]"
3072,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
3073,5,11,Ms Choksondik,"Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin."
3074,5,11,Kyle Two,What?
3075,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Eh, oh, alright. [moves to Kyle Two's desk and squeezes in, and that breathing is heard again]"
3076,5,11,Ms Choksondik,[turns to the blackboard] Now let's get on with our lesson on the-
3077,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
3078,5,11,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, ugh!"
3079,5,11,Ms Choksondik,"[faces the class] I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do. [turns to the blackboard again] Now let's get back to the le-"
3080,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?"
3081,5,11,Ms Choksondik,"[faces the class] Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate."
3082,5,11,Eric Cartman,Oh!
3083,5,11,Ms Choksondik,Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.
3084,5,11,Eric Cartman,"Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!"
3085,5,11,Kyle Two,CARTMAN!
3086,5,11,News Anchor Tom,"Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money. Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device, which he simply calls ""IT"". [""IT"" appears in the window] So what exactly is ""IT""? [""IT?"" appears in the window] Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel. [a window with that reporter pops up and soon fills the screen. Behind him is the Garrison house, and a small crowd is standing outside]"
3087,5,11,Hispanic Reporter,"Thanks, Tom, I-oh... [looks at his lapel and brushes some of the stain off] Thanks, Tom. So far, Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention. He claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one's eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it. But earlier today HBC News got footage of some of the country's top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look, including: Steve Forbes [seen exiting a black limo], Steve Jobs [seen exiting a white limo], Ted Turner [seen exiting a helicopter], Donald Trump [seen exiting a private jet], Bill Gates [seen leaving his own ship, the U.S.S. Bill Gates XP], and Yasmine Bleeth [seen exiting a small dingy car and wiping her nose]. Their curiosity is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What is ""IT""? What does ""IT""do? And when will IT be somewhere where I can buy one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando [trills the Rs], HBC News."
3088,5,11,Kyle Two,"You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, ""Catch the Ball."" I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me."
3089,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands."
3090,5,11,Kyle Two,It's fine!
3091,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?"
3092,5,11,Kyle Two,"Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it. [Kyle's arms spread out] Alright, here we go. [throws the ball, and it lands in the snow in front of Kyle, who just looks at it]"
3093,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Now what?
3094,5,11,Kyle Two,Now throw it back to me.
3095,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),But it's down in the snow.
3096,5,11,Kyle Two,...So dig it out.
3097,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
3098,5,11,Kyle Two,"...Well, then we'll dry them off!"
3099,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Alright, then. [walks to the ball and digs it out]"
3100,5,11,Kyle Two,[turns away] Oh my God.
3101,5,11,Eric Cartman,"[offscreen] Kyle, Kyle! [arrives] I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps."
3102,5,11,Kyle Two,"[Angrily] Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!"
3103,5,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea."
3104,5,11,Kyle Two,"You did, too! You are so full of crap!"
3105,5,11,Eric Cartman,"No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan. [Kyle Two gets even angrier] What a misunderstanding, huh? [tries to be chummy with Kyle. Kyle brushes him off]"
3106,5,11,Kyle Two,"You blew the deal, Cartman!"
3107,5,11,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit, give me another chance!"
3108,5,11,Kyle Two,"[his cousin walks up behind him with the football] Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!"
3109,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Uh you did what? [Kyle Two blanches]
3110,5,11,Kyle Two,[puts his mittens up to his cheeks] Oh no.
3111,5,11,Eric Cartman,"Haha, [slaps him on the back] serves you right, asshole. [leaves]"
3112,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"You, you paid your friends tuh... [hangs his head] not make fun of me?"
3113,5,11,Kyle Two,"Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you."
3114,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me."
3115,5,11,Kyle Two,"Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry."
3116,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
3117,5,11,Kyle Two,What?
3118,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go."
3119,5,11,Kyle Two,"Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh [shuffles away]"
3120,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Boy it sure is dry out here.
3121,5,11,Mr Garrison,"Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!"
3122,5,11,Mr Hat,"That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison."
3123,5,11,Mr Garrison,"It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible [the back gate open and Kyle walks in] is IT's patented gyroscope design. [he backs up and unveils the vehicle] Gentlemen, I give you, IT!"
3124,5,11,Guests,Whoa.
3125,5,11,Steve Forbes,Nice.
3126,5,11,Donald Trump,Sweet.
3127,5,11,Mr Garrison,"IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour."
3128,5,11,Guests,Whoa. Wow.
3129,5,11,Bill Gates,This will change everything.
3130,5,11,Steve Jobs,We're going to have to rethink cities!
3131,5,11,Mr Garrison,"[puts on a helmet] Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering. [operates each one as he describes it] The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. [gets into the wheel and activates the flexigrip. It extends into his anus and he groans as it locks him in.]"
3132,5,11,Guests,Ugh. Oh.
3133,5,11,Mr Garrison,"...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such. [begins to suck on the flexigrip, then stops] Put the four together and we're ready to go. [gets the four flexigrips to work in unison and the vehicles takes off, first one way...]"
3134,5,11,Steve Jobs,Oh my God! [...and then the other. The guests turn to see IT zoom across the yard]
3135,5,11,Steve Forbes,"Look at it go! [Garrison crashes through the fence and disappears in the distance. Kyle, standing next to the new hole in the fence, isn't hurt]"
3136,5,11,Bill Gates,But the way it works... do you think people will go through that to travel?
3137,5,11,Steve Forbes,"Hey, it... still beats what you go through at the airports."
3138,5,11,Guest 1,True.
3139,5,11,Guest 2,Yup.
3140,5,11,Guest 3,"Yeah, that's true."
3141,5,11,Guest 4,Yeap.
3142,5,11,Kyle Two,"I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane."
3143,5,11,Stan Marsh,"I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass."
3144,5,11,Kyle Two,"I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews."
3145,5,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype."
3146,5,11,Kyle Two,Ya see?
3147,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),[opens the door] I'm ba-ack!
3148,5,11,Kyle Two,[slaps his head] Ugh.
3149,5,11,Stan Marsh,"Book. Later, dude. [leaves the desk, walks to the door and around Kyle, and exits. Kyle Two gets out his own writing book and starts writing. Kyle's breathing can be heard, and Kyle Two stops. Kyle eats a bit of cracker and Kyle Two resumes writing. After a while he grimaces, then buries his face in his arms]"
3150,5,11,Field Reporter Jeff Arrando,"Tom, the day is finally here. IT has arrived for retail sale, and people are getting their first look at it."
3151,5,11,Mr Garrison,"[showing Craig's father how it works] Okay, good. Just step through here [the man does so] And then this is your steering and here's your throttle."
3152,5,11,Craig s father,Okay. [starts working the flexigrips]
3153,5,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch."
3154,5,11,Craig s father,[feeling it] HAAAOW!
3155,5,11,Mr Garrison,"It's alright, it's just locking you in. [some more groans from the man] You can take it. [looks up to see another rider] Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride? [she mumbles something, gives a thumbs-up, and continues driving. Garrison goes back to Craig's father] Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off. [the man gets all four flexigrips going, and he begins to roll down the street. Two men bring out a new one] Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? [an elderly woman steps forth grinning]"
3156,5,11,Randy Marsh,"Oh, man, it that the IT?"
3157,5,11,Craig s Father,Hehyeah.
3158,5,11,Stuart McCormick,How is it?
3159,5,11,Craig s Father,"Well, ugh. Ih ih it beats dealing with the airline companies, that's for sure. [rolls on]"
3160,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous."
3161,5,11,Kyle Two,"Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn."
3162,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"It seems like I might get splinters, though."
3163,5,11,Kyle Two,"[moves to the front of the sled to face his cousin] Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on."
3164,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Hold on. I see. [...a bus. It revs up and leaves, headed for Connecticut. The rope between the bus and sled tightens, and the sled takes off] Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast."
3165,5,11,Kyle Two,[calls out] Hang on!
3166,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! [the bus goes around a corner and is gone]"
3167,5,11,Kyle Two,How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
3168,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),It's a least a couple of hours.
3169,5,11,Kyle Two,Think he'll be alright?
3170,5,11,Eric Cartman,[leaving] He's faaahn.
3171,5,11,Announcer,"[shot of a plane in the air, then of a full cabin] Are you tired of corporate airline companies treating you like a worthless sardine? [angry faces crowded into each other] Tired of ridiculous lines and horrible security at airports? [angry, vocal crowds yelling at security guards who seem to be taking their time. Next: shot of the plane in midflight again] Well, now there is an alternative to airline travel. [Next shot, an IT zooming down the road. The camera now moves along with IT] IT. [the driver leans to the left a bit to see where he's going] IT has taken the country by storm. [A J-mart is shown, and several ITs are parked out in the lot] And already two million have been sold. [An IT driver is shown going down the street. Another IT driver passes him] Never have another important business trip ruined by airline incompetence. [two elderly women ride to the edge of a canyon] Hey ladies! How did you get to the Grand Canyon? [they answer, but their voices carry and blur in the canyon. Next shot: a woman exits her house with her baby] IT comes in sizes for the entire family."
3172,5,11,Woman,"[putting the baby, Robby, into his own small IT.] Here you go, Robby. [Robby cries]"
3173,5,11,John Travolta,"[in a studio stage, Stage C, somewhere, gets off his chair] Hello, I'm John Travolta. I used to rely on airlines to get me to set, but once I got used to IT, [walks over to IT and gets in] I found it to be a little less painful than dealing with the airline companies. I just power up the flexigrips. [groans in pain as the anal flexigrip takes hold] And I'm ready to go. Thank you, IT. [revs up and takes off.]"
3174,5,11,Announcer,[a shot of ITs entering and leaving a parking lot] So join the millions of Americans who have felt a little more comfortable with... traveling. [the oral flexigrip squirts something in a driver's eye. The IT logo appears] Order yours today and remember our slogan: IT's better than flying.
3175,5,11,Kyle Two,"...Hm, that was pretty gay. [starts humming, and Sheila enters the room]"
3176,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle Two, where is Kyle?"
3177,5,11,Kyle Two,"[poised] I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding."
3178,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,Where on earth could he be? [starts to leave]
3179,5,11,Kyle Two,"You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut."
3180,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,[quickly returns] What?
3181,5,11,Kyle Two,"Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her."
3182,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends."
3183,5,11,Kyle Two,I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. [the doorbell rings and he goes to answer the door]
3184,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),[at the door] I'm ba-ack.
3185,5,11,Kyle Two,AAA!
3186,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),[enters] I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. [looks at Kyle Two]
3187,5,11,Kyle Two,"A, a bus. R-really?"
3188,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"[rushes up] Kyle, what happened to you??"
3189,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas. [gives Kyle Two the remains of the sled] I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle."
3190,5,11,Kyle Two,"Oh no- don't worry about it, dude."
3191,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes. [leads him away. Kyle Two looks dismayed] Are you alright?
3192,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long."
3193,5,11,Mr Garrison,"We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat... [Jimbo, holding his lower back, walks up to Mr. Garrison] Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?"
3194,5,11,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT."
3195,5,11,Mr Garrison,"[reaches under his desk and pulls out a form] Oh, right, right. Take a seat."
3196,5,11,Jimbo Kern,"Uh, that's okay, I'll stand."
3197,5,11,Mr Garrison,"[Randy walks up to the desk] What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?"
3198,5,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works."
3199,5,11,Mr Garrison,Sure.
3200,5,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, [walks back to IT] it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle."
3201,5,11,Mr Garrison,Yeup.
3202,5,11,Randy Marsh,[returns to the desk] Well... so... they don't really... do anything.
3203,5,11,Mr Garrison,Right.
3204,5,11,Randy Marsh,"So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?"
3205,5,11,Mr Garrison,"[thinks about this a moment] Well, I... guess you could. [a view of the showroom]"
3206,5,11,Man 1,Huh?
3207,5,11,Man 2,Whazzat?
3208,5,11,Man 3,Wha- what did you- what did he say?
3209,5,11,Man 4,What?
3210,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
3211,5,11,Kyle Two,"Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport."
3212,5,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is."
3213,5,11,Kyle Two,"[leans towards Stan and in a low voice] Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave. [looks at the guard] Ey! Can we speed things up here??"
3214,5,11,Airport Security Guard,"Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees."
3215,5,11,Kyle Two,"Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!"
3216,5,11,Airport Security Guard,"Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus... times... divided... two hours domestic, three hours international."
3217,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
3218,5,11,Kyle Two,No!
3219,5,11,Airport Security Guard,"[to Kenny] Dah ha! What's this?! A toenail clipper! [rises to his feet and aims a gun at Kenny] Die, terrorist! [kills him with one shot]"
3220,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Oh, Jesus!! [the corpse starts to bleed]"
3221,5,11,Airport Security Guard,"See, we do these checks for a reason!"
3222,5,11,Kyle Two,"This is ridiculous! Come on! [leaves. The others except Kyle follow. Cartman stops and pulls Kyle away. The boys head through some doors designated for employees only, with security bypass]"
3223,5,11,Kyle Two,"Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting. [Kyle Two pulls Kyle away, Stan follows]"
3224,5,11,Eric Cartman,"[turns toward the landing gear and buried his face in a wheel, then starts counting] 1, 2, 3, 4..."
3225,5,11,Kyle Two,"[Stan and Kyle Two stop at a box] Here, Kyle. You go hide in here. [shows him the box]"
3226,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
3227,5,11,Kyle Two,JUST GET IN THE BOX!
3228,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Uh, alright then. [goes in. Stan and Kyle Two quickly seal the box with wrapping tape and carry it off] Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle. [the two boys toss the box into a luggage cart, an employee tosses the box onto the conveyor, and it falls into the cargo bay with the other luggage] Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- [the plane taxis to the runway and is ready to take off]"
3229,5,11,Kyle Two,I hope he doesn't suffocate.
3230,5,11,Eric Cartman,[leaving] He's faaahn.
3231,5,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. [he and Kyle watch the plane lift off]
3232,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast! [as the plane climbs, the side of it is shown: Air Antarctica] Oh, I did it again!!"
3233,5,11,Mr Garrison,"Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?"
3234,5,11,Agent 1,"It's alright, we're with the government."
3235,5,11,Agent 2,We're just shutting you down.
3236,5,11,Mr Garrison,Shutting me down? Why?
3237,5,11,Agent 3,[the first two agents exit with an IT] The airlines are in desperate trouble. Your vehicle is causing them to lose money.
3238,5,11,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!"
3239,5,11,Agent 4,"Right, so the government is bailing the airlines out again, by shutting you down and making ITs illegal."
3240,5,11,Mr Garrison,"OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding! [pounds the desk]"
3241,5,11,Agent 5,"Sir, many people work for the airlines. We can't let them all be fired."
3242,5,11,Mr Garrison,THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!
3243,5,11,Agent 6,"That may be true. But if you build, sell, or ride another IT, ""it"" will be the last time. Have a nice night. [the agent and his partner walk off with the last IT and Garrison is left with a barren showroom]"
3244,5,11,Mr Garrison,"HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! [the agents, in their black cars and big rigs, leave]"
3245,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?"
3246,5,11,Kyle Two,"I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air."
3247,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there."
3248,5,11,Kyle Two,"[gets off the sofa] I already checked the playground, Ma. [reaches the front door and opens it] I told you, he isn't really- [turns in astonishment to see Kyle back at the front door]"
3249,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),I'm back.
3250,5,11,Kyle Two,GAAAH! [hangs his head in dismay]
3251,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,[offscreen] Kyle! [Kyle enters] You're back!
3252,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there."
3253,5,11,Stan Marsh,"So dude, did Cartman's idea work?"
3254,5,11,Kyle Two,"No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home."
3255,5,11,Stan Marsh,Damn!
3256,5,11,Kyle Two,I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
3257,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"[approaching with Sheila, carrying suitcases, ready to go home] Well, Kyle, I I gotta go."
3258,5,11,Kyle Two,[the boys are stunned] ...What?
3259,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut."
3260,5,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back."
3261,5,11,Kyle Two,"[gasps in relief and turns to Kyle] Do you promise?? [steps back] I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?"
3262,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. [heads for the door with Sheila]"
3263,5,11,Kyle Two,"Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon. [once Kyle is out of earshot, says in a low voice] Not too soon, I hope."
3264,5,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, haha."
3265,5,11,Eric Cartman,Heheheheheh. [the door is heard opening and they realize what Kyle just told them]
3266,5,11,All Three,Five million dollars??? [they quickly rush up to Kyle and block him from leaving the house. Sheila is already outside]
3267,5,11,Kyle Two,Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??
3268,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya."
3269,5,11,Kyle Two,"[holds his palms out] Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!"
3270,5,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
3271,5,11,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
3272,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),Re- really?
3273,5,11,Kyle Two,"Yeah. You see, I've learned something today. [Sheila watches from outside, waiting for Kyle. Music starts up] Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,... [music dies] and um... Let's see, what did I learn about? [voice fading, strokes his chin] What did I learn about today?"
3274,5,11,Eric Cartman,"[steps forth] I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait."
3275,5,11,Kyle Two,"Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?"
3276,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags."
3277,5,11,Kyle Two,... Uhwhat?
3278,5,11,Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two),"I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog. [picks up his suitcases and goes towards the door] Ah I can't take it. See ya. [walks out and joins his aunt to the car. The boys are left stunned, having been judged and found wanting once again]"
3279,5,11,Kyle Two,Dude! Weak.
3280,5,11,Eric Cartman,"[turns to Kyle] ...Good job, Jew!"
3281,5,12,Butters Stotch,"...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and... [throws his head back, closes his eyes, and chants] O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh- [the belching volcano draws his attention as it coughs up the ""lava""] Aw, it's all uh g-gooey."
3282,5,12,Ms Choksondik,"Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check."
3283,5,12,Butters Stotch,"Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik! [wheels his experiment back to his desk] I got a check. That's like a C!"
3284,5,12,Ms Choksondik,Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric? [tape is heard leaving its spool] Eric Cartman?
3285,5,12,Eric Cartman,"[wrapping something together] Stand by, please."
3286,5,12,Ms Choksondik,NOW Eric!
3287,5,12,Eric Cartman,"[leaving his seat] Oh, god dammit!"
3288,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,Haha!
3289,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Shutup, Jew! [moves to the clearing, turns around, and faces the class. He clears his throat] Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature."
3290,5,12,Ms Choksondik,You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.
3291,5,12,Eric Cartman,Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
3292,5,12,Ms Choksondik,Siddown. [Cartman walks towards his desk]
3293,5,12,Eric Cartman,I'll make you eat your parents!
3294,5,12,Ms Choksondik,What did you say?!
3295,5,12,Eric Cartman,Nothing! [takes his seat]
3296,5,12,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, Token, you're next. [Token leaves his seat carrying a laptop computer, then turns towards the class]"
3297,5,12,Token Black,"Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site. [pops open the case and displays the page] I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. [pulls the projector over and plugs it into the laptop, then runs the graph. The resulting projection shows cloud formations moving across the U.S. Ms. Choksondik is impressed]"
3298,5,12,Clyde Donovan,Wwooww.
3299,5,12,Token Black,"[turns around and shows some sheets to the class] I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. [hands her the papers]"
3300,5,12,Ms Choksondik,"Very very good, Token. You get a check plus."
3301,5,12,Token Black,Alright! [goes back to his seat with his laptop]
3302,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Aw, that is such bullcrap!"
3303,5,12,Ms Choksondik,"[sigh] Eric, for the love of God. [drops her head down to her desk]"
3304,5,12,Eric Cartman,"No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!"
3305,5,12,Token Black,My family isn't rich.
3306,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!"
3307,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Your family is rich, dude."
3308,5,12,Token Black,But I...
3309,5,12,Eric Cartman,"[leaves his seat and walks over to Token] Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we? [tugs at his sweater] Ooooo, Armani Exchange!"
3310,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,Aharmani Exchange?
3311,5,12,Eric Cartman,"All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?! [Token opens his mouth to say something, but shuts it up instead] I didn't think so! [moves back to his seat.]"
3312,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table."
3313,5,12,Butters Stotch,Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? [zoom in on Token's face as he realizes they may be right]
3314,5,12,Linda Williams,[notices and lowers her book] Hello Token. How was school today?
3315,5,12,Token Black,Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? [both parents blink and lower their reading materials]
3316,5,12,Bob,"Well, because we have more money, son."
3317,5,12,Token Black,I know. But why?
3318,5,12,Bob,"...W-well, because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town. For instance, your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's mother is a crack whore. One pays more than the other."
3319,5,12,Linda Williams,"Why, sweetie? What's the matter?"
3320,5,12,Token Black,All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.
3321,5,12,Bob,...Oh.
3322,5,12,Token Black,"I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!"
3323,5,12,Linda Williams,[voice quivering] J mart?
3324,5,12,Bob,"[comforts Linda] Son, you, you don't know what you're saying."
3325,5,12,Token Black,"I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. [his parents blink and look at each other]"
3326,5,12,Bob,"You... sure you want to do this, son?"
3327,5,12,Token Black,"I'm sure. [the SUV stops and Token hops out. His parents follow, but just stand by the car]"
3328,5,12,Linda Williams,Hmmm...
3329,5,12,Bob,Where's the... valet?
3330,5,12,Linda Williams,He must be parkiing someone else's car.
3331,5,12,Bob,"Ah, here we go. [moves to his right as a man approaches and stops the man] Take good care of it, please. [puts the keys in the man's hands] Here's twenty dollars. [the man just stands there. The family walks into J mart through the center doors] Hoh? [shields his eyes from the lights] They've activated some kind of alien blinding device."
3332,5,12,Token Black,"That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting."
3333,5,12,Bob,[relaxing] Oh.
3334,5,12,Linda Williams,"[calling out] Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? [an obese blonde woman appears]"
3335,5,12,Obese Woman,"Aisle 6, next to the pretzels."
3336,5,12,Bob,[eyes widen] Next to the-?!
3337,5,12,Token Black,"Come on! [runs forth. His parents follow, his father shielding his eyes. Token stops at a clothes rack and pulls out a pair of pants] Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?"
3338,5,12,Linda Williams,"What, what brand are they?"
3339,5,12,Token Black,"It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants."
3340,5,12,Randy Marsh,"[nearby with Sharon, who is checking out toilet paper] Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?"
3341,5,12,Sharon Marsh,"[puts the paper in the shopping cart] Huh? [looks to see] Oh. Yeah, it is. [they see Token look at more pants] What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. [nearby two shopping carts clash]"
3342,5,12,Liane Cartman,"Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here."
3343,5,12,Sheila Broflovski,"I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. [others stop and stare as Token brings out another pair of pants for comparison. More people stop and stare, and a long silence follows]"
3344,5,12,Bob,"S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here."
3345,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars."
3346,5,12,Token Black,[enters the room] Hey you guys. [has a DVD under his arm]
3347,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?"
3348,5,12,Token Black,I sure did.
3349,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you changed your clothes, Token."
3350,5,12,Token Black,"Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart."
3351,5,12,Stan Marsh,"[gets up and walks over to Token] Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. [stops next to Token]"
3352,5,12,Token Black,Here you go. [hands him a DVD disk]
3353,5,12,Stan Marsh,[looks at the disk] What's that?
3354,5,12,Token Black,It's a DVD of the Lion King
3355,5,12,Stan Marsh,DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
3356,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. [rises and joins Stan and Token] Nobody does. They're too expensive."
3357,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. [the others laugh and gether around Token]"
3358,5,12,Craig Tucker,Don't you have a VHS of it?
3359,5,12,Token Black,I only have this.
3360,5,12,Eric Cartman,"[takes the DVD and holds it up] Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. [the others laugh]"
3361,5,12,Token Black,What's a VHS?
3362,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, dude. [Lowers the disk and laughs with the others]"
3363,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. [heads for the door]"
3364,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[jokingly] What's a VHS? [laughs and the others laugh as they head for the door. Cartman tosses the DVD to Token, but it just falls to the floor.]"
3365,5,12,Token Black,"Why can't I be like all the other kids?
[sees Kenny and brother Kevin playing on their lawn. Kenny is flying around getting dizzy while Kevin plays with a deflated basketball.]
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
[hops onto a wooden box and peeks in - he sees Butters eating]
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
[leaves the window and walks over to Stark's Pond, then sits and pulls out a dollar coin from a small collection. The pond has thawed, and lily pods can be seen on the water. Token tosses the coin, and it skips across the water. He then walks on and stops across the street from the South Park Welfare Office. Craig and his family leave the office with their welfare check as Cartman and mom walk in.]
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
[he fades into a baseball uniform and holds a bat with Barry Bonds' signature on it]
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
[across the street he sees a baseball game, with Kyle pitching, Cartman catching, Stan at bat, Clyde in left field, and three other boys. Sticks and cones are being used. Stan hits the cone. It sails away and Stan rounds the bases]
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
[drops his bat and glove and walks away, then stops and gets a look of determination.]
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
[rushes home and goes to his desk to work on something - a 2-page tabloid ad extolling South Park as the next Aspen]
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
[he finishes, puts the ad into a sturdy envelope addressed to Forbes Magazine Department with some bills, and goes to the window to look at the sunset. Outside, the camera pulls back from the window]
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town
[As the camera pulls back, Token's house is shown to be big indeed, with a three- or four-car garage set back some distance from the street. To the right, two more houses appear, but they are small next to the Williams house.]"
3366,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"Ooo, look at this, honey. [his wife Jada walks up] A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!"
3367,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"""Like Aspen was 30 years ago."" Sounds nice."
3368,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.
3369,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"Oh Will, the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids!"
3370,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,O kids? [they show up]
3371,5,12,Older Boy,"Yes, Daddy?"
3372,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?
3373,5,12,Older Boy,"The mountains, Daddy?"
3374,5,12,Girl,Can we have horses?
3375,5,12,Older Boy,O can we? Can we Daddy?
3376,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,You bet!
3377,5,12,Kids,Hooray!
3378,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"Well, here it is. Our home to be."
3379,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"Oh, Will, it's beautiful."
3380,5,12,Token Black,[turns to greet them] Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!
3381,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths."
3382,5,12,Older Boy,"Ah, a local boy. You shall be our new playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel [the younger boy grins and waves]"
3383,5,12,Token Black,I'm Token.
3384,5,12,Lisa,Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?
3385,5,12,Token Black,"Aah, he's a lawyer. I think."
3386,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town."
3387,5,12,Frederick,"Very well. Come, local boy. [the kids move off] Show us how to play your mountain games."
3388,5,12,Token Black,"All right! [rushes to catch up to them, but returns and stops] Thanks, God. [runs to catch up with the others]"
3389,5,12,Token Black,...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.
3390,5,12,Frederick,"Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe."
3391,5,12,Token Black,"[with relief] You do? God, that's great!"
3392,5,12,"Fredreick, Lisa, and Daniel Smith",Why?
3393,5,12,Token Black,"I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda [motions a low palm] low to [raises his arm to shoulder level] middle-income."
3394,5,12,Lisa,Why? What happened to all their money?
3395,5,12,Token Black,"Well, they never really had any money."
3396,5,12,Lisa,"Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?"
3397,5,12,Token Black,Well I... think that.. they...
3398,5,12,Frederick,Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.
3399,5,12,Lisa,Indeed.
3400,5,12,Frederick,Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.
3401,5,12,Lisa,"So we must plead with him: [falls on her knees] ""Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy."""
3402,5,12,"Fredreick, Lisa, and Daniel Smith","[falls on his knees] ""Please, Daddy, please!"""
3403,5,12,Frederick,"[falls on his knees] ""Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!"""
3404,5,12,Lisa,"""I want a llama, Daddy!"""
3405,5,12,Frederick,"""I'd do the picture, Daddy!"""
3406,5,12,Lisa,"""Please, Daddy!"""
3407,5,12,Frederick,"""Daddy, please!"""
3408,5,12,Lisa,"""Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!"""
3409,5,12,"Fredreick, Lisa, and Daniel Smith","""But Daddy!"" [all three rise]"
3410,5,12,Frederick,And so Daddy does the picture.
3411,5,12,Token Black,...That's ...great.
3412,5,12,Lisa,Twenty million dollars great.
3413,5,12,Snoop Dogg,I found a girl who had an innie and I felt her with my jimmyPlayer-haters try to do me 'cause my rhymes are just tooo-
3414,5,12,Engineer,"Sorry, Snoop Dogg, but Will Smith is on line three for you?"
3415,5,12,Snoop Dogg,Oh. [removes his headphones and answers the telephone] William! How are you buddy?
3416,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"[back in South Park on a public phone] Great, Snoop Dogg, and you?"
3417,5,12,Snoop Dogg,Couldn't be better. I'm just laying down some vocals for my new album.
3418,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"[chuckle] Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses?"
3419,5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all the time."
3420,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful."
3421,5,12,Snoop Dogg,Ogh. It sounds lovely!
3422,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.
3423,5,12,Snoop Dogg,"I certainly will, William. And perhaps I'll give ol' Maigc and Kobe Bryant a call. They've been looking for vacation properties as well."
3424,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording."
3425,5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Hah, see you soon. Bye. [hangs up and puts on his headphones]"
3426,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,Bye. [hangs up]
3427,5,12,Snoop Dogg,"Alright, let's take it from the top, gang. [the rhythm starts up again and plays for a few seconds...]I shout ""Hell Yeah!"" from my vehicle. Livin' is a miracle-"
3428,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Look, there's more of them moving into our town. [other men join these three. Among them are Randy, Gerald, Stuart, and Skeeter] You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main."
3429,5,12,Jimbo Kern,"Yep, there goes the neighborhood. [a shot of the new family headed for the house]"
3430,5,12,Mr Garrison,That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
3431,5,12,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey! W-what are you saying? What ""types""?"
3432,5,12,Mr Garrison,"[pointing] Yiou know, those types! Rich people! [shot of movers and family members moving furniture into the new home]"
3433,5,12,Jimbo Kern,Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
3434,5,12,Ned Gerblansky,Nnnope.
3435,5,12,Jimbo Kern,"I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!"
3436,5,12,Skeeter,"They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!"
3437,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!"
3438,5,12,Skeeter,"Damn, I hate those stupid richers!"
3439,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Yeah. [calls out] Hey, rich guy! [a man holding a box of dishes is laughing at something his partner said, but both men look at Mr. Garrison, and the grin vanishes] Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook? [the men laugh]"
3440,5,12,Jimbo Kern,Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! [the men laugh again]
3441,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers! [the men laugh. The two black men just look at this crowd] Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! [laughs. The two men across the street look at each other, confused, and go into the house with the boxes they pulled from the truck]"
3442,5,12,Jimbo Kern,I guess we showed them!
3443,5,12,Oprah Winfrey,"A little to the left. That's great and- Let's put another pool over there. [a kid stands across the street, behind Oprah] Uh huh, good. [close-up in the kid - it's Token. Frederick approaches him from screen left]"
3444,5,12,Frederick,"Token, these are Oprah's newly-adopted children, Dominique and Zizi."
3445,5,12,Dominique and Zizi,Hello. [Lisa and Daniel join Frederick so that Dominique and Zizi are behind them]
3446,5,12,Token Black,Hi.
3447,5,12,A Boy,[enters screen right] Cheerio!
3448,5,12,Frederick,"Ah, and these are Puff Daddy's kids: P Diddy Mini, P Poofy Bite-size, and Poppa Diddy Diddy Puff Fun-size."
3449,5,12,Token Black,"Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding."
3450,5,12,Lisa,"Oh no, we're going shopping."
3451,5,12,The Kids,[exulting] Shopping!
3452,5,12,Frederick,"Yes, come Token. We're all going to head down to the mall and buy some of the stores. [the group begins to move screen left as Token stands there]"
3453,5,12,Token Black,Oh. Alright then. [turns right and joins the group]
3454,5,12,Kobe Bryant,"'Scuse me, can ew get a couple of beers here? [the jukebox stops and all the bar patrons look at the new guests.]"
3455,5,12,Skeeter,They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's.
3456,5,12,Kobe Bryant,"That's alright, we just want some cheap beer tonight. [the men at the bar glare at the three men]"
3457,5,12,Barkeep,...Maybe you didn't see the sign out front: This bar is for people livin' below their means ONLY!
3458,5,12,Men,Yeah!
3459,5,12,Kobe Bryant,This is a free country. I can have a drink wherever I want.
3460,5,12,Man 1,"[stands up and urges] Come on, Kobe, let's just go."
3461,5,12,Kobe Bryant,[]This ain't over! This ain't over by a long shot! [leads his two friends out of the bar]
3462,5,12,Mr Garrison,[turns to the bar with the others next to him] Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!
3463,5,12,Ned Gerblansky,Nn-what do you mean?
3464,5,12,Mr Garrison,"How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase ""t""!"
3465,5,12,Jimbo Kern,"Lowercase ""t""?"
3466,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, for ""time to leave""!"
3467,5,12,Bar Patrons,Yeah!
3468,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase ""t""! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!"
3469,5,12,Mr Garrison,Alright!
3470,5,12,Kobe Bryant,Tee. T- Time to- leave?
3471,5,12,Mr Garrison,"[from some bushes across the street] T is for ""time to leave,"" cashchucker!"
3472,5,12,Kobe Bryant,I'm callin' the police. [moves inside to make the call]
3473,5,12,Skeeter,I think we scared 'im.
3474,5,12,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!"
3475,5,12,Men,Yeah!
3476,5,12,Frederick,"Now Token, polo is very simple. You simply must hit the williard into some cilium with your fracaman."
3477,5,12,Token Black,"Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? [the other players laugh]"
3478,5,12,Frederick,"[playfully jabs Token] ""Can't we play without the uniforms?"" Yes, um. Lert's eat caviar without Bellini's as well! [the others laugh] Now come, Token, and remember: it doesn't matter who wins. It matters who wins three times in a row. Tally ho!"
3479,5,12,Child Polo Players,Tally ho!
3480,5,12,Player 1,Oh!
3481,5,12,Player 2,Yay!
3482,5,12,Player 3,This is exciting.
3483,5,12,Player 4,"Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful!"
3484,5,12,Eric Cartman,What in the hell are they doing?
3485,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,Is that fun?
3486,5,12,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play."
3487,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Well, let's just play our game, then."
3488,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,Alright.
3489,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! [goes over and kicks Kenny in the nuts - Roshambo has begin!]"
3490,5,12,Kenny McCormick,(Ow!)
3491,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,"I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! [goes and does so. Kenny kicks Cartman in the nuts. Cartman returns the favor]"
3492,5,12,Stan Marsh,"I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! [leaves Kyle and kicks Cartman in the nuts. When he turns around Kenny kicks him in the nuts.]"
3493,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Kick his nutsack! [kicks Kyle in the nuts. Stan kicks Kenny in the nuts. Token rides up and stops to watch the boys while the game continues. Soon, a player and horse ram into his and knocks him and his horse away - It's Frederick.]"
3494,5,12,Frederick,"You see, you must pay attention, Token. I was able to jollyrow your davishmere with a forecastle."
3495,5,12,Token Black,[rises and dusts himself off as his horse leaves] This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?
3496,5,12,Player,A snowball fight?
3497,5,12,Lisa,How barbaric.
3498,5,12,Frederick,"Yes, Token, if you want to play such savage games, I suggest you go live with lions. [the other players laugh at him as we turns wand walks away from them.]"
3499,5,12,Token Black,I don't fit in anywhere.
3500,5,12,Passenger 1,"Hey! What are you doing? If you're going to ride the bus in South Park, you're gonna have to sit in the FRONT!"
3501,5,12,Passengers,Yeah
3502,5,12,Passenger 2,"Yeah, that's where the first-class seating is! [points to the front. The Cosbys rise and head for the front, where four seats are empty. His daughter takes a seat to his left, across the aisle, his son takes a window seat, and he takes the aisle seat next to his son.]"
3503,5,12,Passenger 1,"Yeah. How do you like that, richer?!"
3504,5,12,Bill Cosby,"Well it's very nice, actually"
3505,5,12,Passenger 1,"Yeah, I'll bet it is!"
3506,5,12,Bill Cosby,"Very, very comfy."
3507,5,12,Passenger 1,"Uh huh, looks like it."
3508,5,12,Token Black,"Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you. [the camera pulls back to reveal the field is actually a lion's lair. A sign outside the lair says AFRICANUS LIONUS CARNIVORUS. A waterfall gurgles nearby and lions laze about] So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be. [two lions growl at him] Uuuh, yeah."
3509,5,12,Chef,"Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- [he hears voices and spins around. A group of rich folk are marching in protest]"
3510,5,12,Millionaire Protesters,We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
3511,5,12,Oprah Winfrey,"You there, come march with us!"
3512,5,12,Chef,For what?
3513,5,12,Oprah Winfrey,All the poor people in town think they can persecute and harass us decent rich folk.
3514,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,So we're uniting and marching on the town square!
3515,5,12,Kobe Bryant,[raises his fist a la Black Power] The Million Millionaire March!
3516,5,12,Millionaire Protesters,Yeah!
3517,5,12,Oprah Winfrey,"Come on, brother! [the protesters resume the march]"
3518,5,12,Chef,But... I'm not rich.
3519,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,[stops and looks at Chef] What? [the others stop]
3520,5,12,Chef,I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
3521,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,We'll give you a hundred dollars.
3522,5,12,Chef,"Woo, fudge the snow now. [tosses the shovel away and joins the march]"
3523,5,12,Millionaire Protesters,We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
3524,5,12,Chef,[with the others] I shall perservere. We shall perservere.
3525,5,12,Token Black,RRrrr!! [rips a piece of steak off with his teeth and chews on it]
3526,5,12,Milly Larsen,"[rushes up to the lair cage] Look at the little black lion, Mommy. [her mother passes by with her little sister in a stroller]"
3527,5,12,Mrs Larsen,"He's cute, isn't he? [the girl rejoins her mom and walks away. Two lions growl at each other and stand up, then leap down off their rock and stand next to Token. He move his steak out of their reach]"
3528,5,12,Token Black,Roar! [the lions step back and look at each other]
3529,5,12,Lion 1,"What are you doing here, boy?"
3530,5,12,Token Black,"You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!"
3531,5,12,Lion 2,You're not becoming a lion. The only way you can do that is to see Aslan.
3532,5,12,Token Black,Who's Aslan?
3533,5,12,Lion 1,"Very well, walk this way. [they walk off, and Token gets on all fours to follow them. They go through a low entrance into a white cave in the middle of which sits a great lion - Aslan]"
3534,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,[regal voice] Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?
3535,5,12,Lion 2,Yes. [two other lions come in and watch]
3536,5,12,Token Black,Are... you... Aslan?
3537,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,M-I am.
3538,5,12,Token Black,"[rises] Well, I'm Token"
3539,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,"So, you want to live with the lions, do you?"
3540,5,12,Token Black,Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.
3541,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,And what makes you think you can fit it with us?
3542,5,12,Token Black,"Well, I don't know."
3543,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,Do you like jokes?
3544,5,12,Token Black,What?
3545,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,"Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes."
3546,5,12,Token Black,...I like jokes a lot.
3547,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,"Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw. [holds up his left paw. Token looks at it, and Aslan moves it closer to him] Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm! [Token approaches it and pulls the thron out. Aslan farts and the two escort lions snicker softly] Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho! [the other lions burst out laughing]"
3548,5,12,Token Black,So can I stay?
3549,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.
3550,5,12,Reporter,"[not seen yet] A billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight [now seen on TV] in South Park to petition the end of separate bars, bus seating and restaurants. It looks like it will be a great turnout, as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand Mexicans to march for them. [a marcher carrying a rake and shover hears this and turns around]"
3551,5,12,Skeeter,"If they get that petition passed, it's all over."
3552,5,12,Jimbo Kern,I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
3553,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?"
3554,5,12,Skeeter,"They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town."
3555,5,12,Mr Garrison,No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything? [the other men think about this for a second]
3556,5,12,Jimbo Kern,...Ghosts?
3557,5,12,Mr Garrison,Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!
3558,5,12,Men,Yeah!
3559,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!"
3560,5,12,Men,Alright! Yeah! Let's Go! Right!
3561,5,12,Token Black,Huuuunh [...and walks over to Aslan] Aslan.
3562,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,"Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice?"
3563,5,12,Token Black,...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.
3564,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.
3565,5,12,Token Black,"They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best."
3566,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,"It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?"
3567,5,12,Token Black,[recalling that lions love jokes] ...No thanks.
3568,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,Go on. It's spearmint!
3569,5,12,Token Black,"No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger."
3570,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,"Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!"
3571,5,12,Token Black,"[pulls the stick out of the pack, and a small spring-loaded bar hits his thumb] Ow. [half-heartedly]"
3572,5,12,Aslan the Lion and other lions,[leads the other lions in a bout of hysterics] That is good stuhuff! [continues laughing with the other lions]
3573,5,12,Token Black,"[under his breath, as he leaves the lair] Jesus, lions suck!"
3574,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: ""We will be separated no more!"""
3575,5,12,Millionaires,Hooray!
3576,5,12,Mayor McDaniels,"This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws."
3577,5,12,Millionaires,Yeah!
3578,5,12,Mayor McDaniels,And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.
3579,5,12,Voices,"Woooooo!! [""ghosts"" appear from behind the various town buildings and rush towards the millioaire crowd. They surround the crowd, still makign ghost noises. The millionaires are startled]"
3580,5,12,Oprah Winfrey,What the-?
3581,5,12,Mayor McDaniels,"[shuts her eyes] God no. [Will Smith moves around not knowing what to do. A ""ghost"" spooks him]"
3582,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"AAAaaahhh! [the ""ghosts"" begin to disperse the millionaires]"
3583,5,12,Millionaire 1,"Carl, do you see what I see?"
3584,5,12,Carl and Martin,"Yes, Martin. I do believe this town is hainted. [two ""ghosts"" come up and startle Martin and Carl. Nearby, Will Smith's kids stand in a huddle, scared]"
3585,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,Kids! Go find the limo and get in! [the kids hurry off.]
3586,5,12,Snoop Dogg,[walks up to Smith] You didn't tell me this town was hainted!
3587,5,12,Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,"I didn't know! [grabs Snoop and shakes him] I.. DIDN'T... KNOHOHOHOW... [both men turn and flee as several ""ghosts"" move in on them. The ""ghosts"" take their sheets off: it's Skeeter, Mr. Garrison, Gerald, and Randy]"
3588,5,12,Skeeter,It's working!
3589,5,12,Gerald Broflovski,They're scared to death!
3590,5,12,Millionaire,"Pack up your things quickly! We've got to get out of here! [some ""ghosts"" pop out from the bushes and drive the family away with their haunting noises.]"
3591,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh hey, there's Token. [Token approaches them from the opposite direction]"
3592,5,12,Token Black,Hey guys.
3593,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?"
3594,5,12,Token Black,"You mean, you want me around?"
3595,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Sure, dude, you're our friend."
3596,5,12,Token Black,"Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich."
3597,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you."
3598,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy."
3599,5,12,Butters Stotch,They sure do.
3600,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew."
3601,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,Right.
3602,5,12,Token Black,"That's right, huh?"
3603,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
3604,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I get it for that."
3605,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,And Cartman for being fat.
3606,5,12,Eric Cartman,Uh huh.
3607,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,And Cartman for being stupid.
3608,5,12,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
3609,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
3610,5,12,Eric Cartman,Hey.
3611,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
3612,5,12,Eric Cartman,"Ey, you did me already!"
3613,5,12,Token Black,"You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich."
3614,5,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore."
3615,5,12,Token Black,You're not?
3616,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy."
3617,5,12,Stan Marsh,"[walks past Token] Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic."
3618,5,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks past Token, behind Stan] Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss."
3619,5,12,Eric Cartman,"[walks past Token, behind Kyle] Pussy. [Pip walks by without saying anything]"
3620,5,12,Butters Stotch,"[walks past Token, behind Pip] Heh yeah, later, puss."
3621,5,12,Craig Tucker,"[walks past Token, behind Butters] Ha, that guy's a pussy. [drags a sled behnd him. On the sled is Kenny, dead and badly beat up, with his right eye hanging out of its socket. Tweek and Clyde bring up the rear, and Token looks as they leave him behind]"
3622,5,12,Token Black,[turns to face the other boys] Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! [walks behind the other boys]
3623,5,12,Skeeter,That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!
3624,5,12,Men,Alright!
3625,5,12,Gerald Broflovski,"They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!"
3626,5,12,Mr Garrison,"That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!"
3627,5,12,Men,[confused] What?
3628,5,12,Jimbo Kern,"But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park."
3629,5,12,Randy Marsh,Yeah. You'd become what you hate.
3630,5,12,Mr Garrison,"Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-"
3631,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for your abortion? [picks up her chart and reads as canned laughter is heard]"
3632,5,13,Ms Sanders,"Ready as I'm ever going to be, I guess. [the laughter quiets down a bit, but still rolls]"
3633,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"Well, try to relax; It will all be over very soon. [more laughter]"
3634,5,13,Ms Sanders,"Docter, can we turn off that television? [switch to a wide shot of the room, and the television is seen. On screen is a comedy skit featuring Benny Hill and an elderly man. That's where the laughter comes from]"
3635,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"[looks up first] Oh yes, I 'm sorry.
[moves to turn off the set and a close-up of the skit is shown: Benny Hill, dressed as a constable, raps the old man on the head and then shoos him along. The set is turned off, and the doctor returns to the woman's bed.]
Now, there is one more thing."
3636,5,13,Ms Sanders,What?
3637,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,Have you heard of stem-cell research?
3638,5,13,Ms Sanders,"Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but... I don't know what it is."
3639,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses- [taps the woman's leg] ah- I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies."
3640,5,13,Ms Sanders,"Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others."
3641,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,The hope is that someday it might. [hands her the release form and she signs it]
3642,5,13,Ms Sanders,"Well okay. [hands the form back to him]
Doctor: Great. [puts the form inside the cart] Well, here we go. [puts on his gloves]"
3643,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,Nurse? [a nurse arrives] This is to go to Alder's Labs for stem-cell research.
3644,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"Yes, Doctor."
3645,5,13,Truck Driver,"...going places that I've never been
Seeing things that I may never see a- Uuugh! [a deer leaps into the read ahead of him and looks at him] Jesus Christ!! [swerves to avoid the deer and goes over a cliff, tumbling down its side. It lands somewhere below with its contents spilled all over the place. The driver is killed on impact, but the song continues to play...]"
3646,5,13,Cartman,[rides along] My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm. [sees the trashed truck and its contents] What do we have heah? [strokes his chin]
3647,5,13,Stan,Well that burned a long time.
3648,5,13,Kyle,"Yeah, that was pretty good. [a cow near them drops five pellets and walks off]"
3649,5,13,Stan,"[all three rush to the new dung] Oh dude, there goes one."
3650,5,13,Kyle,"[to Kenny] 'K go! [Kenny strikes a match and lights the dung, which yields a nice fire]"
3651,5,13,Stan,Alright!
3652,5,13,Kyle,Alright!
3653,5,13,Kenny,(That's awesome) [coughs heavily]
3654,5,13,Kyle,"You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?"
3655,5,13,Kenny,(All right. I'm fine.)
3656,5,13,Butters,"[rushing up to them] Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!"
3657,5,13,Stan,"What, Butters?"
3658,5,13,Butters,Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
3659,5,13,Stan,Tell him we're busy.
3660,5,13,Butters,"Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this."
3661,5,13,Kyle,"What, did he lose a hundred pounds? [the boys laugh]"
3662,5,13,Butters,"Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew. [the boys stop laughing and look at him] Yeah."
3663,5,13,Stan,"Alright, let's go see what he wants. [the boys turn right and leave. Butters stays behind and looks at the melted turds. He approaches, squats, and sticks his finger in it]"
3664,5,13,Butters,"Oh, it's all sticky. [wipes his finger off on his coat, leaving a streak of turd on it]"
3665,5,13,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!"
3666,5,13,Cartman,"Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!"
3667,5,13,Stan,What?
3668,5,13,Cartman,Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
3669,5,13,Kyle,A trampoline?
3670,5,13,Cartman,Better.
3671,5,13,Stan,A boat?
3672,5,13,Cartman,Better.
3673,5,13,Kenny,(A football machine?)
3674,5,13,Cartman,Better.
3675,5,13,Stan,"Well WHAT, Cartman?"
3676,5,13,Cartman,Thirty-three aborted fetuses. [the boys look back at him for a long time] Oh yes.
3677,5,13,Kyle,...What? [closes his eyes in disbelief]
3678,5,13,Cartman,"Mint condition, tax free."
3679,5,13,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!"
3680,5,13,Kyle,I'm leaving right now! [turns and heads for the door]
3681,5,13,Cartman,"Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!"
3682,5,13,Kyle,"[turns around] You've never watched the news, fatass! [rejoins Stan and Kenny] And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!"
3683,5,13,Cartman,"Stem cells, numbnuts!"
3684,5,13,Stan,Stem cells?
3685,5,13,Kyle,"Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!"
3686,5,13,Kenny,(What the fuck are stem cells?)
3687,5,13,Kyle,"They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases."
3688,5,13,Cartman,"[points at Kyle] It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest."
3689,5,13,Kyle,...I hate you so much. [turns around and heads back for the door again. The others turn and follow. Kenny coughs again.]
3690,5,13,Cartman,Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
3691,5,13,Cartman,"Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.:[later] 
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy.

[later] 

Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck.

[later] 

I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake. [suddenly grins and covers the receiver with his right hand] That's a joke [removes his hand from the receiver] ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye. [hangs up and relaxes, putting his feet up on his desk and his hands behind his head] Damn I'm good."
3692,5,13,Alder Research Group Receptionist,Can I help you?
3693,5,13,Cartman,"Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?"
3694,5,13,Alder Research Group Receptionist,"Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident."
3695,5,13,Cartman,"[rips out a bill...] Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?"
3696,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"[in the background, walking by] This is awful, just awful!"
3697,5,13,Alder Research Group Receptionist,Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.
3698,5,13,Cartman,"[picks up and carries a box] You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch."
3699,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"[the researcher] Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now."
3700,5,13,Cartman,"...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!"
3701,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research.
3702,5,13,Alder Research Group Receptionist,A ban? Why?
3703,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people."
3704,5,13,Cartman,"[Cartman's mouth opens in disbelief, then he gets angry] Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! [throws the box down on the floor, breaking it and spilling its contents. Now there are thirty-two aborted fetuses]"
3705,5,13,Stan,"Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again."
3706,5,13,Kyle,"[he and Stan take their seats] Yeah, they're gonna get busted again."
3707,5,13,Ms Choksondik,"[enters carrying a few books] Alright, class, let's take our seats. [sets the book down on her desk and turns to the class] Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office."
3708,5,13,Stan,"The principal? Aw, come on!"
3709,5,13,Kyle,"We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!"
3710,5,13,Ms Choksondik,"She needs to see you now! [points to the door. Stan and Kyle leave their seats, Kyle leading Stan]"
3711,5,13,Kyle,"Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat."
3712,5,13,Principal Victoria,"Hello, boys."
3713,5,13,Stan,Wait. What's going on here? [he and Kyle back up a bit. Their parents join them]
3714,5,13,Kyle,"Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know."
3715,5,13,Mr Mackey,"[Chef has joined the principal and Mr. Mackey] You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat. [the boys each take a chair and sit down] Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay. [the boys look stunned] And well, he's pretty sick. [Sharon leans on Randy]"
3716,5,13,Kyle,Kenny's sick?
3717,5,13,Stan,Well how sick?
3718,5,13,Chef,"Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease."
3719,5,13,Stan,"[after a pause] ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?"
3720,5,13,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Oh dear. [buries her face in Randy's shoulder]
3721,5,13,Stan,"Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better."
3722,5,13,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Randy...
3723,5,13,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon."
3724,5,13,Kyle,Wait. Kenny's going to die?
3725,5,13,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"...He might, Kyle."
3726,5,13,Stan,[tearing up] ...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
3727,5,13,Mr Mackey,"We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever."
3728,5,13,Stan,No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! [buries his face in Randy's arm and begins sobbing]
3729,5,13,Cartman,"Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.:[later. There are now thirty-one] 
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. [hangs up and sighs deeply]"
3730,5,13,Liane Cartman,"[opens the door and looks in] Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you."
3731,5,13,Cartman,"Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil."
3732,5,13,Liane Cartman,They say it's an emergency.
3733,5,13,Cartman,"[shifts in his chair] Buh, alright. [Liane leaves] eh, Butters?"
3734,5,13,Butters,"[steps into view in Cartman's room] Uh, yeah?"
3735,5,13,Cartman,Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
3736,5,13,Butters,"Eh, just about."
3737,5,13,Cartman,"[leaving his chair and heading for his door] Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit."
3738,5,13,Butters,"Oh. Well, uh okay. [approached Cartman's chair and hops on]"
3739,5,13,Cartman,[turns around] Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
3740,5,13,Butters,"Right. [picks up the phone and checks out the next number. Cartman leaves. Butters starts dialing] Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls."
3741,5,13,Cartman,"What is this, a PTA meeting? [before him stand his mother, Sheila, Kyle, and Stan. Stan's head hangs forward as he looks down]"
3742,5,13,Kyle,Cartman. [pause] Kenny's in the hospital.
3743,5,13,Cartman,[shock and distress flashes across his face] In the ...hospital? Why?
3744,5,13,Kyle,"They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. [Stan raises his head and looks at Kyle]"
3745,5,13,Cartman,[more worried] Die? Kenny?
3746,5,13,Stan,[looks up at Kyle] Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
3747,5,13,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come."
3748,5,13,Cartman,"Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. [turns and goes up the stairs]"
3749,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"[fixing an IV for Kenny] There we go, little buddy."
3750,5,13,Kenny,"(Thank you, Doc.)"
3751,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm.
3752,5,13,Kenny,(I'm all right)
3753,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"Hey, look who has some visitors. [walks in with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]"
3754,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny. [the nurse and doctor leave the room.]"
3755,5,13,Kyle,"[volunteers] Hey dude, how's it going?"
3756,5,13,Kenny,"(I'm okay, I guess.)"
3757,5,13,Cartman,We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
3758,5,13,Kyle,"Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude."
3759,5,13,Cartman,"Heh, sorry. [Stan remains speechless. Kenny looks at his friends and coughs violently]"
3760,5,13,Kyle,"Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?"
3761,5,13,Stan,"[finds his voice] I- [looks at Kenny, then at Kyle, then at Kenny, and rushes out the door]"
3762,5,13,Kyle,"[looks around] Stan? [sees him and follows] Stan, where are you going?"
3763,5,13,Stan,"I can't, I just can't."
3764,5,13,Kyle,"Dude, he needs us right now."
3765,5,13,Stan,"[turns around] I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing."
3766,5,13,Kyle,"I, I know it's tough but- [Stan turns away] Look at me! [turns him back around] I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!"
3767,5,13,Stan,"And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!"
3768,5,13,Kyle,"Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!"
3769,5,13,Stan,[turns around and walks away] Just leave me alone!
3770,5,13,Kyle,"Stan, you can't leave!"
3771,5,13,Stan,"[turns once more, with tears in his eyes] I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! [turns and leaves. Kyle turns to go back to the hospital, but sighs silently]"
3772,5,13,Cartman,"[with emotion in his voice] ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know."
3773,5,13,Kenny,"(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)"
3774,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"[opens the door and looks in] Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now."
3775,5,13,Cartman,"Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! [walks towards the door. The nurse leaves, then Cartman exits]"
3776,5,13,Kyle,[returning to Kenny's room] Cartman?
3777,5,13,Cartman,"[composes himself] Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? [sniffles]"
3778,5,13,Kyle,"Cartman, were you... crying?"
3779,5,13,Cartman,"' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh. [breaks down again, but tries to hide it] Oh man."
3780,5,13,Kyle,"Hey Cartman. [Cartman looks up and turns around] I care a lot about him, too. [Cartman wells up again, and Kyle reaches out to hug him]"
3781,5,13,Cartman,"I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure."
3782,5,13,Kyle,"[comforting him] Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will."
3783,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"[enters with Cartman] This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up."
3784,5,13,Cartman,"Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?"
3785,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand?"
3786,5,13,Cartman,"Not at all, but go on. [they both turn and approach a table. On the table is a cage with a rat inside it.]"
3787,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine."
3788,5,13,Cartman,My God...
3789,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.
3790,5,13,Cartman,"So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue."
3791,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,That's the theory.
3792,5,13,Cartman,"Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!"
3793,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber."
3794,5,13,Cartman,Hmmm.
3795,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know."
3796,5,13,Cartman,Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. [turns around and heads for the exit]
3797,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,Where are you going?
3798,5,13,Cartman,"There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves."
3799,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"Hey kid. [music stops, then a pause] Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell. [strikes his fists together, one over the other. Cartman returns the gesture with a thumbs-up, then walks off... then stops]"
3800,5,13,Cartman,"Oh, doctor. [Larry turns around. Cartman has his thumb up] Thanks. Thanks. [Larry returns the gesture with his own thumb up, and Cartman leaves again.]"
3801,5,13,Researcher Dr. Larry,"Oh, hey kid. [Cartman returns] Good luck. Good luck. [Cartman gives a thumb up, walks away, then backs up]"
3802,5,13,Cartman,"Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. [walks away]"
3803,5,13,Kyle,"...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! [shows him the picture: Butters and Kenny are in a little yellow biplane]"
3804,5,13,Chef,"Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?"
3805,5,13,Kenny,(Yes.) [coughs a bit] (But what about Stan?)
3806,5,13,Kyle,"Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny."
3807,5,13,Kenny,(I hope so)
3808,5,13,Planned Parenthood Doctor and Nurse,"[opens the door] Hey, look who's here."
3809,5,13,Kenny,[perks up a bit] (Stan??)
3810,5,13,Woman,"[walks in with balloons and an assistant] Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin."
3811,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation",We're with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. [a cameraman walks in and moves to the head of Kenny's bed]
3812,5,13,Ms McCormick,"Oh, Kenny, isn't that nice?"
3813,5,13,Kenny,(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)
3814,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation",We travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish.
3815,5,13,Kyle,"Neat, huh Kenny?"
3816,5,13,Kenny,(Yes.)
3817,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation","So Kenny, if you could have ONE wish, what would it be? [there's no answer. A moment of silence]"
3818,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation","What's your wish, pal?"
3819,5,13,Kenny,(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)
3820,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation",What did he say?
3821,5,13,Kyle,He said his wish is not to die. [a long stretch of silence in which the cameraman looks from person to person.]
3822,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation","...O-kay, and, what if you're gonna have two wishes, what would the second one be?"
3823,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation","I know! I bet you wanna meet Madonna, huh?"
3824,5,13,Kenny,(No. Fuckin' Madonna...) [his words trail off and are hard to understand]
3825,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation",Wu- what was that?
3826,5,13,Kyle,"He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. [the Foundation reps are stunned. Madonna appears in the doorway]"
3827,5,13,Madonna,Should I come in now?
3828,5,13,"Laura Jones and Bob Ferrin, from Make-A-Wish Foundation",Uh no not quite yet.
3829,5,13,Chef,"[approaches] Hello there, children."
3830,5,13,Stan,Hey Chef.
3831,5,13,Chef,How's it goin'?
3832,5,13,Stan,Bad.
3833,5,13,Chef,Yeah. Things have been better.
3834,5,13,Stan,"Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?"
3835,5,13,Chef,"[sighs] Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand."
3836,5,13,Stan,"But then, why does God give us anything to start with?"
3837,5,13,Chef,"Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. [pause]"
3838,5,13,Stan,I think I understand.
3839,5,13,Cartman,"My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds. [a shot of Congress] I love Kenny McCormick and... [sob] I want you to love him too. [cries as Congresspeople look to each other] And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song [takes a deep breath]
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do"
3840,5,13,Congressman 1,One look from you and I would fall from grace.
3841,5,13,Congressman 2,And that would wipe the smile right from my face.
3842,5,13,Congressman 1,Do you remember when we used to dance? [three Congressmen perform the following: two leg slaps and a clap]
3843,5,13,Cartman,Do you remember when we used to dance? [three Congressmen perform the following: two leg slaps and a clap]
3844,5,13,A few Congressmen,And incidents arose from circumstance? [more Congressmen perform the moves]
3845,5,13,Everyone,"One thing led to another; we were young [everyone does the moves, and the result is thunderous]
And we would scream together songs unsung
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what our hearts meant
The heat of the moment
shone in your eyes"
3846,5,13,Cartman,"And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs."
3847,5,13,Woman,"Oh, I don't know."
3848,5,13,Cartman,"Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill."
3849,5,13,Jill,"Seventy-five dollars? Well, alright."
3850,5,13,Cartman,"[hands the clipboard over for her to sign the release form] Great, just sign right here, please. [another woman arrives] Hi. Havin' an abortion today? [Jill hands him the clipboard back, then heads for the clinic] Great. [to the second woman] Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there. [she nods and reaches for the clipboard.] And you sign right here. [hands her the clipboard and she signs. A couple passes by] Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? [the second woman enters the clinic]"
3851,5,13,Woman 2,We're not going to the abortion clinic. I'm going to have this baby.
3852,5,13,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life."
3853,5,13,Man in Wheelchair,"Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one."
3854,5,13,Woman 2,"Oh Mark, I love you."
3855,5,13,Cartman,Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
3856,5,13,Head nurse,"[at her station] Young man, do you know where you're going?"
3857,5,13,Stan,"Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now."
3858,5,13,Head nurse,All right! [Stan passes a man in a wheelchair]
3859,5,13,Man In Wheelchair,Go kid! [Stan passes a man on crutches]
3860,5,13,Man On Crutches,"Good for you! [Stan passes a doctor and nurse, and they smile]"
3861,5,13,Stan,"Hey, Kenny! [grins, then is stunned. The room is empty. Kenny is gone. Due to terminal illness.] Oh no. [Kyle walks up to the room, but stays outside] No."
3862,5,13,Kyle,He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
3863,5,13,Stan,"But... [a shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye. [another shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] Did he say anything before he went?"
3864,5,13,Kyle,"He just said... ""Where's Stan?"""
3865,5,13,Mr Garrison,"And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue."
3866,5,13,Stan,I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. [the doors fly open and Cartman walks in. He sees his friends and they look back.]
3867,5,13,Cartman,You guys! Come quick! [Stan and Kyle look surprised]
3868,5,13,Kyle,"What, Cartman?"
3869,5,13,Cartman,"It's... [Cartman turns around] Why, it's a miracle, you guys! [rushes out the door to a spot on the side of the road. Stan and Kyle follow.]"
3870,5,13,Stan,"What, Cartman? What's happened?"
3871,5,13,Cartman,"Look. [across the street stands a Shakey's Pizza] I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's! [oozing sounds are heard as a new Shakey's is indeed rising up next to the current one] It worked! [Kyle is shocked.]"
3872,5,13,Stan,"This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?"
3873,5,13,Cartman,Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
3874,5,13,Kyle,"I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you."
3875,5,13,Cartman,"I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies, [Kyle turns and faces him angrily] and I can finish up the kitchen."
3876,5,13,Kyle,AAARGH! [jumps up on Cartman and starts pummeling him. Cartman tosses him off]
3877,5,13,Cartman,Aah! Kyle! [Kyle punches him across the face a few times] Kyle! [Kyle delivers a series of punches to the chest]
3878,5,13,Stan,"Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend! [Kyle gives Cartman a good roundhouse right and Cartman falls on the ground, face first.] Cartman was! [Kyle continues beating Cartman up]"
3879,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya."
3880,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon? [chuckles]"
3881,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[puts her hands on her hips] Oh, you!"
3882,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Just kidding. [lowers the newspaper and takes the gift from Butters and shakes it] Oh, I wonder what it is."
3883,5,14,Butters Stotch,"It's a- [covers his mouth for a second, then looks down] Awww, shucks, [looks at his dad] I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty."
3884,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!"
3885,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it?? [starts running around the coffee table in excitement] Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! [stops and bounces with excitement]"
3886,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days."
3887,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!"
3888,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir","Who's the boy that can laugh at a storm cloud?
Turn a frown into a smile for free?
Who's the kid with a heart full of magic?

Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?
If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find
A little boy named Butters!"
3893,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[In the splash screen, the hole he was in is gone] Thaat's that's me, [brings his fists together twice.] Yeah. [walks off to his left]."
3894,5,14,Butters Stotch,[making calculations on a sheet of paper at the coffee table] Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
3895,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[rises and walks over to Mom] Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. [hugs her gently]Linda: I hope he means me, haha. [Dad turns and walks to the door.]Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you."
3896,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[at the front door] I'll be back in a little bit. [Butters rises to see him off] Butters, you're in charge of the house."
3897,5,14,Butters Stotch,[salutes] Yes sir! [Dad exits and closes the door. Butters moves back to the table.]
3898,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[walking towards the door] Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?"
3899,5,14,Butters Stotch,We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
3900,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[walks around Butters to the other end of the coffee table] Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short. [walks away towards the camera and stops, wondering] I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to."
3901,5,14,Butters Stotch,Dad's a good shopper all right.
3902,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[kneels beside Butters] Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me."
3903,5,14,Butters Stotch,"You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?"
3904,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[rises and goes to the computer] No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? [takes a badge from the desk and shows it to Butters.]"
3905,5,14,Butters Stotch,Sure I do!
3906,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing. [hands the badge to Butters, who puts it on] What do you say?"

3916,5,14,Butters Stotch,I sure did. [walks over to the breakfast table and takes a seat] Dad sure had a nice night out.
3917,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?"
3918,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well first, he went to see a movie."
3919,5,14,Linda Stotch,A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
3920,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat. [Mom freezes] I didn't know it was open. [a look of dread is on her face]"
3921,5,14,Linda Stotch,Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
3922,5,14,Butters Stotch,"""Fisting Firemen 9"" [her dread turns to shock] I've never seen 1 through 8."
3923,5,14,Linda Stotch,Oh my God...
3924,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him."
3925,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?"
3926,5,14,Butters Stotch,To the gym.
3927,5,14,Linda Stotch,To the gym?
3928,5,14,Butters Stotch,Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
3929,5,14,Linda Stotch,[stung by that revelation] Gaah!
3930,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!"
3931,5,14,Linda Stotch,[really shocked] ...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
3932,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures. [holds them up for his mom to see. She walks over and takes them from him. She sees her husband gong into the theater, then into the spa, then being rammed by a man from behind...] The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'. [his mom faints right to the floor] Oh, did you have a nice ""trip,"" Mom? See you next ""fall."" Hahaha, yo- Ma?"
3933,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",...Butters!
3934,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] Uh, that's me!"
3935,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[in a fractured, disturbed voice] Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint."
3936,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times."
3937,5,14,Linda Stotch,Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!
3938,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[approaches Butters] Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?"
3939,5,14,Butters Stotch,Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
3940,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. [walks towards the front door.]"
3941,5,14,Linda Stotch,[paints furiously now] Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.
3942,5,14,Chris Stotch,[opens the door] I'll be back in a little while. [exits]
3943,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[walks over to the door] Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?"
3944,5,14,Linda Stotch,"I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again. [rolls some paint on him downwards] Paaiint. [rolls some paint on him upwards] Paaiint. [turns around and walks away, leaving a confused Butters behind] Must be made clean. New."
3945,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. [opens the door and exits.]"
3946,5,14,Linda Stotch,[alone with her thoughts in front of a family photo] Must clean Butters. [paints over her face] Clean. Never be clean. Must... [paints over Butters' face] kill? The only way? Must kill Butters. [paints some more over their faces] Paaiint.
3947,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",...Butters!
3948,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
3949,5,14,Butters Stotch,One please.
3950,5,14,White Swallow Spa Attendant,Locker two thirteen! [a towel pops out through a dispenser next to the window]
3951,5,14,Butters Stotch,Uh thanks! [takes the towel and heads for the spa's locker room.]
3952,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[appears in the doorway] Dad? [walks in] Dad, you in here?"
3953,5,14,Butters Stotch,Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
3954,5,14,Man,"[voice only] There, do you think that works?"
3955,5,14,Mr Garrison,"[voice only] Well, that's four fingers; try five."
3956,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, Mr. Garrison?"
3957,5,14,Mr Garrison,...Who is that?!
3958,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[reaches the second door to his left, which is ajar] Da-ad? Da-ad?? [pushes the door open] Are you wrestlin' in here? [gets a better look: two men are engaged in anal intercourse] Dad?"
3959,5,14,Mr Slave,This room's taken.
3960,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs. [exits and closes that door, then moves to the opposite room and looks in] Dad? No. [leaves that room and moves to the third door to his right] Hm. [opens the door: his father is masturbating, but Butters doesn't know what that is.]"
3961,5,14,Chris Stotch,[sees his son at the door and quickly covers himself] OOH! BUTTERS!
3962,5,14,Butters Stotch,Hi Dad! [waves and smiles]
3963,5,14,Chris Stotch,[now with towel in hand] Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!
3964,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?"
3965,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[quite embarrassed, has the towel in position] Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you."
3966,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. [backs out and closes the door]"
3967,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[now distraught] Oh, Jesus, no. OH, what have I done?"
3968,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",Everyone knows it's Butters!
3969,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
3970,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[closes a book, rises and calls out] Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?"
3971,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[appears in the doorway] Uh, hey Dad."
3972,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Come here, son. [taps his lap. Butters enters and approaches] I wanna have a talk with you."
3973,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[hops onto his father's lap] Well, sure thing, Dad."
3974,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying."
3975,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so."
3976,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Yes, it sure can be. [pause] But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called ""little white lies."""
3977,5,14,Butters Stotch,Little white lies?
3978,5,14,Chris Stotch,"You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house."
3979,5,14,Butters Stotch,"...Uh, who's Jack?"
3980,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane."
3981,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh no, that won't happen, Dad."
3982,5,14,Chris Stotch,"It won't? Oh, good."
3983,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine."
3984,5,14,Chris Stotch,You... what?
3985,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[In the doorway] Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now."
3986,5,14,Butters Stotch,"A drive? Oh, boy! [puts his fists together twice] I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?"
3987,5,14,Linda Stotch,"No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think."
3988,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[hops off his dad's lap] Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad. [walks out after his mother] Oh boy, a drive!"
3989,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along."
3990,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[with a blank expression on her face] Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?"
3991,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too."
3992,5,14,Linda Stotch,"And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best."
3993,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself."
3994,5,14,Linda Stotch,"If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert."
3995,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere? [begins searching] It's cold out here."
3996,5,14,Linda Stotch,"I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters. [Butters looks up at her] I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened."
3997,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then. [she moves the gear shift to neutral, releases the emergency brake, opens the driver-side door, and exits. She walks away from the water, and the car starts to move forward] You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom. [cut to a view of the water from the dock] Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water."
3998,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[close up. Her hands are together, fingertips touching] Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon."
3999,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[a view of the dock from the water] Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water! [she turns away as the car leaves the dock] Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! [she walks away]"

4006,5,14,Linda Stotch,[snaps back] You don't know anything!
4007,5,14,Chris Stotch,"I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!"
4008,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[sobbing] Then why, Chris, why?!"
4009,5,14,Chris Stotch,"It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!"
4010,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Well, [glares at him] you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! [turns away and sobs]"
4011,5,14,Chris Stotch,"No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you. [she removes the noose and falls to the floor] We can have a normal life!"
4012,5,14,Linda Stotch,"There is no going back, Chris!"

4018,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[snaps] I WASN'T THINKING! [catches her breath] I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you! [points at him, then breaks down] Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- [dissolves into sobs]"
4019,5,14,Chris Stotch,[confused] This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.
4020,5,14,Linda Stotch,Just go away and let me die! [sobs]

4022,5,14,Linda Stotch,"I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! [lays down on the floor face first and pounds it with her right fist]"
4023,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Linda, Butters is gone. [drops into thought] Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! [she start weeping, then he starts, and they both weep...]"
4024,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now. [the car floats down some more and crashes into some boulders. The passenger-side door flies open] Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt. [unfastens it and lets it go. He scrambles out and over the boulders] Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home. [before him are some low hills and the Rockies in the background.

When asked who the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, ""Some Puerto Rican guy."" Naturally, the police are in an all-out manhunt for Some Puerto Rican Guy.

4069,5,14,Gas Station Mechanic,"'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod. [the camera pans to the right and stops at a terrifying road. It is lined with spooky trees with faces on them, dark threatening clouds overhead, and eerie sounds.] 'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod."
4070,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[unsure, blinks] ...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow, [starts walking] and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em."

4105,5,14,Butters Stotch,"...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
[the eerie sound is heard again, and three red dots are aimed at his forehead - he has been targeted by someone, or something... He turns right again and looks into the trees. Someone looks back, and turns on thermal vision. A neon view of Butters is shown. Butters turns left and start walking again. The three dots remain trained on his forehead]
Oh, nutsack [moves his hands to his mouth and gasps a bit] Oops.

4106,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",Everyone knows it's Butters!
4107,5,14,Butters Stotch,[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
4108,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican! [rises] You have to learn to keep it straight!"
4109,5,14,Linda Stotch,I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
4110,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! [the door opens and Butters walks in]"
4111,5,14,Linda Stotch,Don't forget: your lies started all this. [Butters closes the door]
4112,5,14,Chris Stotch,"My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! [Butters approaches and looks]"
4113,5,14,Butters Stotch,Happy Anniversary!
4114,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Not now, Butters!"
4115,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. [moves off to his left] Alright, then. I-"
4116,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Butters?? [spots him and scoops him up, then shares him with Chris]Oh, Butters!"
4117,5,14,Chris Stotch,Son! I don't believe it! [they both drop on one knee as they hold on to Butters]
4118,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-"
4119,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Oh, my baby's back!"
4120,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I ain't grounded, am I?"
4121,5,14,Chris Stotch,"No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why... [relief fades to spin] Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?"
4122,5,14,Butters Stotch,Lie?
4123,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home."
4124,5,14,Chris Stotch,No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! [both parents set Butters down and rise]
4125,5,14,Linda Stotch,"Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!"
4126,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary."
4127,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[over Butters' voice] Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!"
4128,5,14,Linda Stotch,"You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!"
4129,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh stop it, Mom and Dad."
4130,5,14,Chris Stotch,"Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!"
4131,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Now gosh darn it, you! [steps in between his parents] You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble! [Chris and Linda listen] Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here [puts his right hand to his chin, palm down] with you two! [a few seconds of silence follow]"
4132,5,14,Chris Stotch,...Butters... You're as right as rain.
4133,5,14,Linda Stotch,[genuflects and messes with Butters' hair] You sure are.
4134,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?"
4135,5,14,Linda Stotch,"No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world. [Chris walks over to the phone as Linda and Butters look at each other] And I am so happy you're alive."
4136,5,14,Butters Stotch,"...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?"
4137,5,14,Chris Stotch,"You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing...]"
4138,5,14,Chris Stotch,"We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us. [Butters comes out of the house to stand next to his parents, and cheers are heard in the crowd. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are present]"
4139,5,14,Man in Crowd,"Wow, alright"
4140,5,14,Stan Marsh,Butters was missing?
4141,5,14,Chris Stotch,"But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us."
4142,5,14,Butters Stotch,[points at the crowd] Yeah!
4143,5,14,Linda Stotch,We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
4144,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah! [a shot of the Ramseys, O.J., and Condit]"
4145,5,14,Chris Stotch,"You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers."
4146,5,14,Butters Stotch,"[raises both arms in victory] Ye-! [turns to look at his father, and his arms go down] wait, what?"
4147,5,14,Eric Cartman,Huho!
4148,5,14,Linda Stotch,"[Butters is now afraid of what she might say] And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im."
4149,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!"
4150,5,14,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude."
4151,5,14,Chris Stotch,"So you see, there was no ""Some Puerto Rican Guy."" He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, ""You're a liar! You're a LIAR!"" [points at the crowd, and Condit's fixed-grin face is shown] ""You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!"" [back to Chris] Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, ""Hello,"" but they'd be thinking, ""Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"" [a shot of O.J.] ""You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!"" [back to Chris] And to me, people might say things like, [a shot of Condit] ""LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!"" [back to Chris] And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like, [a shot of the Ramseys] ""You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!"" [a shot of O.J.] ""CONFESS!"" [a shot of Condit] ""LIAR! CONFESS!"" [back to Chris] You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth."
4152,5,14,Linda Stotch,We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
4153,5,14,Chris Stotch,"And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's."
4154,5,14,Man 2 in Crowd,"Yeah-ah-alright! [the parents go back in the house as a stunned Butters stands on the walkway. The crowd disperses and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk up to Butters]"
4155,5,14,Stan Marsh,"Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you."
4156,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now."
4157,5,14,Eric Cartman,We sure are.
4158,5,14,Butters Stotch,"I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay."
4159,5,14,Stan Marsh,Really?
4160,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Naw, I'm lyin'"
4161,5,14,Chris Stotch,"[appears in the doorway] Let's go, son."
4162,5,14,Butters Stotch,"Wuh comin', Dad! [goes inside the house]"
4163,5,14,"""The Butters Show"" Choir",Everyone knows it's Butters!
4164,5,14,Butters Stotch,[returns to the doorway and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
