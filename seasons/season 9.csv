0,9,1,Planned Parenthood Doctor,"Hello, Mr. Garrison, I'm Dr. Biber. I'll be performing your surgery today."
1,9,1,Mr Garrison,"[on the hospital bed, his legs in stirrups] God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again."
2,9,1,Dr Biber,"Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty?"
3,9,1,Mr Garrison,My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.
4,9,1,Dr Biber,"All right, then let's begin. [POV changes to Mr. Garrison looking down past his groin. A nurse hands Dr. Biber a scalpel] Just relax, Mr. Garrison. I think if more people could just see a sex-change operation, they would know how perfectly natural it is. The first thing I'm going to do is slice your balls. [bends down to slice open Mr. Garrison's nutsack - a live slice is shown]"
5,9,1,Mr Garrison,"Ough, ergh. Eww. [his eyes remain shut for the duration of the operation]"
6,9,1,Dr Biber,"With the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles."
7,9,1,Mr Garrison,"So long, balls. [the vas deferens is shown being cut in two, severing the testicle from the rest of the body. A nurse dabs Dr. Biber's forehead with a towel to remove any sweat there]"
8,9,1,Dr Biber,"Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis. [real-life footage is shown]"
9,9,1,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that stings."
10,9,1,Dr Biber,Now I'll just... turn your... penis inside out.
11,9,1,Mr Garrison,OH! Oh jeez.
12,9,1,Dr Biber,All we need to do now is ...stuff the ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips.
13,9,1,Mr Garrison,Do I look like a woman?
14,9,1,Dr Biber,"[reviewing the results, then holds up his left thumb] Pretty much."
15,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, don't be nervous."
16,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
17,9,1,Stan Marsh,"You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure."
18,9,1,Eric Cartman,This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
19,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[points right at Cartman] I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! [a referee's whistle is heard]"
20,9,1,Lead Referee,All students trying out for the All-State team to center court! [Kyle heads for center court]
21,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Good luck. [Kyle reaches center court and is flanked by tall black players on either side. He looks around, seeing how much taller these players are than he. Two of them have basketballs; Kyle has his own ball]"
22,9,1,Coach,"All right boys, now you're all here because you're the best of the best. [the camera pans from left to right, showing all the players - and Kyle's head from the nose up] I know that you've all worked really hard to make it this far, so let's get out there and [throws a basketball at someone] SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT! [play begins, and the taller players keep the ball away from Kyle, then drive toward one of the baskets. Number 32 slams the ball through the hoop. They drive to the opposite basket. Kyle has the ball and shoots, but his shot is rejected. The players head back to the first basket] Uh, uh excuse me, Brof-Broflovski, is it?"
23,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah?
24,9,1,Coach,"Can we talk to you for a minute? [Kyle leaves the court and reaches the coach] You uh... You're the best player in your school, are ya?"
25,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
26,9,1,Coach,"Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game."
27,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oo whataya mean?
28,9,1,Coach,"Well, it's just that... Jew's can't play basketball. [blows his whistle and returns to the other players] Awright, kids, we've gotta work on that shooting! Come on!"
29,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you were awesome, Kyle. [no response. Stan looks at Kenny, then looks back at Kyle] Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. [looks at Kenny, shrugs, and walks away. Kenny walks over, puts his hand on Kyle's shoulder for consolation, then walks away. Cartman looks a bit concerned, walks over to Kyle... and taunts him!]"
30,9,1,Eric Cartman,"Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa! [No response. Cartman can't get a rise out of Kyle] Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time."
31,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,I know. I deserve it.
32,9,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you know why? Because Jews can't play basketball!"
33,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You're right. [this disarms Cartman completely, and he walks away] Jesus, that's no fun."
34,9,1,Man,"[bursts through the main entrance] Hey everybody, you're not gonna believe it!"
35,9,1,Randy Marsh,Believe what?
36,9,1,Man,"It's Mr. Garrison! Only it ISN'T Mr. Garrison! He- He's a woman now! [the doors open again and Mr. Garrison struts in with a new womanly body and purse. He strikes a pose to show off his womanly ass. From here on, he's Mrs. Garrison]"
37,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Hello everybody! [everyone is shocked. She goes further into the store and approaches two female shoppers] Can you believe it ladies? I'm one of YOU now! [hugs them, then heads to the Feminine Hygiene aisle] Wow, just look at all these tampons! Regular, heavy flow- Oh boy, I can't wait till I get my first period! [trots off.]"
38,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Hi gals! [opens her purse and begins putting on makeup] Oh boy, can you believe the sales they're havin' out there? Well, I'm about to pee out my vagina for the first time. [hugs them] Give us a hug. Girls' Club! [lets them go and goes into a stall, closes the door, drops her pants and sits down. She urinates. The two ladies at the sink look at one another, then towards the stall] Oh wow! This is great! Look at that, I'm peeing sittin' down like a dainty dignified little woman! [begins to fart and poop. The women's jaws drop] Sany, any of you ladies wanna go see a sad movie together? [The women present leave the restroom one by one: the blonde first, then the one with light brown hair, then the one exiting the stall left of Mrs. Garrison holding her nose, then the one exiting the stall right of Mrs. Garrison holding her nose. The farting and pooping is just too much] You guys try those new wings tampons? Do those work well?"
39,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball."
40,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. [Mrs. Garrison appears before them]
41,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison! [her fingers are fanned out and she strikes that pose again. The boys are stunned]"
42,9,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties."
43,9,1,Mrs Garrison,[moving her hands over her body as if shedding a layer of skin] I had a sex-change operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class! [saunters off]
44,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
45,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[taken aback] What? Th'um, nuh-nothing. I- I'll explain it to you when you're a little older."
46,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?"
47,9,1,Ike,Penis!
48,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,Your teacher had a sex change?? Oh my God! [buries his face in his hands]
49,9,1,Ike,Vagina!
50,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,That does it! I'm taking you boys OUT OF THAT SCHOOL! [sweeps his left arm across the table]
51,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, that is very closed-minded of you! You shouldn't judge people who want to change."
52,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,He's a teacher! How are we supposed to explain this to our children?!
53,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"[walks over and stands behind Kyle] It's very simple. [addresses Kyle] You see, Kyle, sometimes a person' outside doesn't reflect who they are on the inside."
54,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. That's right.
55,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"They feel like they're somebody trapped in another person's body. And so, they can have a surgery [Kyle smiles and passes his hands over parts of his body he'd change] that makes them more into the person they see themselves as. Do you understand?"
56,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Totally! I totally understand!
57,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"There. You see, Gerald? He totally understands."
58,9,1,Dr Biber,"So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery."
59,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one."
60,9,1,Dr Biber,"Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm."
61,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?"
62,9,1,Dr Biber,Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty.
63,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black."
64,9,1,Dr Biber,...You what?
65,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
66,9,1,Dr Biber,"[tries to make sense of this in his mind, then] Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty!"
67,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! [big grin]
68,9,1,Stan Marsh,Wha-a-a negroplasty??
69,9,1,Dr Biber,"It's a fairly common procedure, really, just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like Michael Jackson had. Let's take a look here. [Kyle follows Dr. Biber. Stan tails along. Dr. Biber stops and bends down towards Kyle, taking off his hat] What we do is slice your face and peel it back so we can insert now pigment producing cells inside. [draws a line along Kyle's forehead and left temple. Stan can't believe what he's seeing] We break the arm bones in several places and put braces to make them longer. [draws lines around the wrists] Now, the knees we need to snap off and fill with small round objects that can cause better movement. [draws two circles around the kneecaps] And we finish it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance the genitalia. [draws a circle around the crotch of Kyle's briefs] Negroplasty takes about seven hours and costs roughly three thousand dollars."
70,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?"
71,9,1,Dr Biber,"Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
72,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Hello, Mr. Slave. [sets them down on the counter] Boy have I been busy. A woman's work is never done. [begins taking the groceries out of the bags] I got some tampons. I should be getting my period really soon. I hope I don't get too emotional and drive you crazy with my PMS. [walks over to Mr. Slave hiding something behind her back, and says seductively] Mr. Slave, I got something for us, too. [brings forth a red negligéйe] Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed?"
73,9,1,Mr Slave,No thanks.
74,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"[taken aback] Nu- no thanks? Come on, Mr. Slave, I wanna try out my new snootch."
75,9,1,Mr Slave,I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.
76,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis."
77,9,1,Mr Slave,But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!
78,9,1,Mrs Garrison,Don't you even care that I was suffering? I wasn't happy the way I was!
79,9,1,Mr Slave,"It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!"
80,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Look, we can still be together. All you have to do is stop being gay!"
81,9,1,Mr Slave,How can you say that?! You're gay too!
82,9,1,Mrs Garrison,I'm not gay! I'm a woman!
83,9,1,Mr Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ! [turns around and heads for the front door]"
84,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Oh, so is that it?! [Mr. Slave opens the front door and walks out, leaving it open] You're just gonna walk out?! You men are all alike! Go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina, you fag! [slams his door shut]"
85,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. [they look up. On Gerald's T-shirt is a picture of two dolphins jumping in the air]
86,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,What??
87,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery. [shows the paper, which is a picture of ]"
88,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, just great! You see, Sheila?! This is what your transgender progressive thinking gets you! Now your son wants to be transracial!"
89,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[quite excited] Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??"
90,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Absolutely not, Kyle!"
91,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,[let down] But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
92,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, but Kyle-"
93,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside."
94,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, you have to accept your body the way it is."
95,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
96,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"The answer is NO, Kyle! You're NOT going to have negroplasty!"
97,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,But Jews can't play basketball! [this sets Gerald off]
98,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, you'd better stop being anti-Semitic right now, mister!!"
99,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[leaves the room and goes up the stairs, stopping halfway] I'm never speaking to either of you ever again! [continues up the stairs and goes to his room. His door is heard being shut. Gerald looks on as all this happens]"
100,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[rises and leaves the sofa] Oh, that does it!"
101,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,Where are you going?!
102,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[stops by the coat rack next to the front door, grabs his coat and puts it on] That Dr. Biber is about to get his ass bitten off! [goes out the front door and slams it shut]"
103,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,Who the hell do you think you are?!
104,9,1,Dr Biber,Dr. Biber.
105,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,What kind of nutjob would agree to surgically alter my son into a tall African-American?!
106,9,1,Dr Biber,"[leaves his chair and approaches Gerald] Oh, you're Kyle's father."
107,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Huh that's right! And I also happen to be a lawyer! And I'm gonna have you sued for malpractice, and your clinic shut down!!"
108,9,1,Dr Biber,What is that on your shirt?
109,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"What th- Look, they're- They're dolphins! Why?"
110,9,1,Dr Biber,"Ahhh you like dolphins, hm? [puts his hands together in an affectionate way]"
111,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"A b--uh I love dolphins, Ever since I was a child I dreamt of... Huh b-b-b- But that has hardly any bearing on what I'm hear to-"
112,9,1,Dr Biber,I can make you one.
113,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,...What?
114,9,1,Dr Biber,"Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head. Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply..."
115,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,[steps aside a little] Make me a... dolphin? [begins to daydream about life as a dolphin.]
116,9,1,Singer,"If I could swim with the dolphins, the soft and gentle dolphins...Why can't I swim with the dolphins?"
117,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"...No. [heads for the door] No, no, it's crazy."
118,9,1,Dr Biber,There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on the inside.
119,9,1,Announcer,"It's Girls Gone Wild! [two women stand there looking at the camera, then lift their blouses all of a sudden and giggle. The words ""Real Girls!"" flash over their breasts] These girls will do anything! [another woman looks around, then flashes her breasts. The word ""Wild!!"" flashes over them. Two other women flash their boos. ""Out of Control!"" flashes over one woman, ""Real Girls!"" over the other. Mrs. Garrison sees an opportunity and comes forward to stand next to the women]"
120,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Oh jeez, should I do it?! Should I do it?! Oh what the hell! [flashes her boobs, which are not bleeped. They're set rather far apart. The other women look at the breasts and leave in disgust] Wooo! Huhuh, wooo!"
121,9,1,Men in Girls Gone Wild commercial,Awww!
122,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Look, I'll giggle and make them bounce up and down! [jumps up and down] Heeheeheeheehee, heeheeheeheeheeheehee."
123,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"[walks up to the bar, which has three women seated at it. One of them is a redhead with short, wavy hair] Oh boy, men will do just about anything to get a look at our tits, won't they? Men are all the same. My boyfriend walked out on me! Turns out he was a fag. But I've been livin' it up ever since, havin' sex with all kinds of different guys! Girl power! [approaches the redhead] You know, the strange thing is, I haven't gotten my period yet. Is there a reason a woman might miss her period?"
124,9,1,Redhead,"Well, normally, if a woman misses her period, it means she's pregnant."
125,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"...Pregnant? [turns away and walks a bit] Oh my God. Of course. [the women at the bar glance back at him] I haven't gotten to experience a period because... one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up. [turns around and shouts] I'm pregnant, everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion! [leaves the bar]"
126,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,[seeing the new Gerald] Gerald! What happened to you?!
127,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"That doctor is a miracle worker, Sheila. Iiii'm the happiest I've ever been. [approaches Ike] Look, Ike! You're daddy's a dolphin! [Ike just looks at him]"
128,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,A dolphin?!?!
129,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[turns around slowly to face her] Sheila, ih-it was wrong of us to be so judgmental of Kyle. If he isn't happy with who he is, then who are we to deny hm surgery that will make him feel better about himself? [his left eye twitches twice, each time accompanied by dolphin calls]"
130,9,1,Sheila Broflovski,"[distraught] Gerald, this is crazy!"
131,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"I used to think I was crazy. But Dr, Biber told me that there are a lot of other people out there who are transspecies. All I did is change my appearance to look the way I felt... [places his right ventral fin to his heart] here. And I'm telling you now that if we don't let Kyle do the same, he may never be happy. Ever! We owe him more than that, Sheila. We owe him understanding! [his blowhole goes off]"
132,9,1,Butters Stotch,"Fellas! Hey fellas, you gotta come see!"
133,9,1,Stan Marsh,What?
134,9,1,Butters Stotch,"Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro! [runs off. The others follow.]"
135,9,1,Jason,Wow.
136,9,1,Craig Tucker,Can't believe it.
137,9,1,Clyde Donovan,Did it hurt?
138,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but it was totally worth it. [Butters arrives with the other boys]"
139,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ, dude!"
140,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!"
141,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[at the front door] Come on, Kyle, we should get going!"
142,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Dad! [trots off]"
143,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?"
144,9,1,Eric Cartman,He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.
145,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"You here for an abortion too? [she blinks] Yeah, I discovered a few days ago I wasn't bleedin' out my coo, so I guess I'm knocked up. Is this doctor any good?"
146,9,1,Planned Parenthood Nurse,Mrs... Garrison?
147,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Oh, that's me. [rises and follows the nurse in]"
148,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion. [sits on the chair and puts his feet on the stirrups]"
149,9,1,Planned Parenthood Doctor,...an abortion?
150,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out? [a nurse arrives and her jaw drops] ...If you want you can just scramble it and I'll queef it out myself."
151,9,1,Planned Parenthood Doctor,Mmister Garrison-
152,9,1,Mrs Garrison,[correcting him] Mrs. Garrison.
153,9,1,Planned Parenthood Doctor,"Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion."
154,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body! [gets up, goes to the nurse, and hugs her] A woman has a right to choose!"
155,9,1,Planned Parenthood Doctor,"No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pregnant."
156,9,1,Mrs Garrison,But I missed my period.
157,9,1,Planned Parenthood Doctor,"You can't have periods either. [Mrs. Garrison looks surprised] You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs."
158,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"[sits down] You mean, I'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out?"
159,9,1,Planned Parenthood Doctor,N-that's right.
160,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis!"
161,9,1,Planned Parenthood Doctor,"Basically, yes."
162,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass."
163,9,1,Mrs Garrison,Hey asshole!
164,9,1,Dr Biber,"Excuse me, I'm performing an operation here!"
165,9,1,Mrs Garrison,You told me you were going to make me into a woman!
166,9,1,Dr Biber,I gave you a sex change.
167,9,1,Mrs Garrison,Yeah?! Well what kind of woman can't have abortions and bleed out her snatch once a month?! You made me into a FREAK is what you did! And I want you to change me back!
168,9,1,Patient at Trinidad Medical Center,Am I a man yet?
169,9,1,Dr Biber,"Mr. Garrison, I can't reattach your organs."
170,9,1,Mrs Garrison,Why the hell not?!
171,9,1,Dr Biber,Because I've already used your testicles to fashion new knees for a little boy who wanted to be tall and black.
172,9,1,Mrs Garrison,You WHAT?!
173,9,1,Dr Biber,And your scrotum has been made into a dorsal fin for a man who wanted to look more like a dolphin.
174,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Oh you! You're comin' with me right now to find my ball and scrotum right now, Mr. Man! [pulls him out the door by the ear]"
175,9,1,Announcer,Welcome to the All-State Basketball Playoffs between the best fourth-grade players from Colorado and the best fourth-grade players from Wyoming. [cheers go up and Kyle arrives just in time]
176,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[panting] Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play."
177,9,1,Coach,Who are you?
178,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?"
179,9,1,Coach,"Well, you're tall and black enough. All right, Broflovski, suit up!"
180,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"All right! [turns around and looks up the bleachers] Dad, I can play! [Gerald is on the steps with his walker]"
181,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Alright Kyle! [tries to find a place to sit. An usher walks by] Excuse me, where do you have special seating for dolphins?"
182,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Boys, have you seen Kyle?! He's not at home."
183,9,1,Stan Marsh,"[points down the road] Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison."
184,9,1,Dr Biber,He's going to play basketball? Oh my God.
185,9,1,Mrs Garrison,What?
186,9,1,Dr Biber,"Well, ah I only made him look like he could play basketball. If he actually does it, the testicle in his knees will explode! [Mrs. Garrison realizes instantly where her former testicles are]"
187,9,1,Stan Marsh,What?! But you made him into a basketball player.
188,9,1,Dr Biber,"No, I just made him look more like one. We have to stop him from playing! Those testicles in his knees are ticking time balls!"
189,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Oh Jesus! We've gotta get to my balls before Kyle hurts himself! [everyone gets into the car, and the car peels off]"
190,9,1,Singer,...and the home of the... brave! [the lights come up and everyone cheers. The teams take the floor for the jump ball. The referee tosses the ball up and Colorado #32 taps the ball to his team]
191,9,1,Coach,"Broflovski, be ready to take over for Owens."
192,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! [The stitches along his upper chest, arms, and cheeks are seen. The camera pans down to show the bandages on his elbows and knees and the stitches along his legs]"
193,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Eh excuse me, where, where is the bathroom for dolphins?"
194,9,1,Usher,We don't... have one.
195,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,Well where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? I I need a large tank with salt water.
196,9,1,Usher,Ahhh- Too bad?
197,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Damnit you people have to make special arrangements for transspecies people like me! I may be a dolphin, but I'm also a lawyer!"
198,9,1,Usher,You're a lawphin?
199,9,1,Usher,Tickets please.
200,9,1,Mrs Garrison,We don't have tickets!
201,9,1,Security Guard,"[appearing next to the usher] Sorry ma'am, no tickets, no entry."
202,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Look, there's a boy with my balls in his knees and he's in serious danger!"
203,9,1,Usher,What?
204,9,1,Mrs Garrison,[looks past the men and points] My scrotum! [he sees Gerald talking to the usher by the restrooms] That dolphin has my scrotum! Now let us in!
205,9,1,Security Guard,"You can't go in, ma'am! [Mrs. Garrison delivers a right hook to the guard and the guard goes down. Mrs. Garrison and the others rush in. The guard gets up and calls for help on his walkie-talkie] We have unauthorized entry on level one!"
206,9,1,Coach,"All right. Broflovski, you're going in next possession."
207,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,All right! [stands and feels pain in his knees. He soothes them] Ow. Hm. [goes to the locker room]
208,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Gerald, where's Kyle?!"
209,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,What? Why??
210,9,1,Mrs Garrison,My balls are in his knees. If he jumps with them they'll explode!
211,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,Oh my God! [Security guards swarm nearby]
212,9,1,Security Guard,"There they are, next to that dolphin!"
213,9,1,Dr Biber,"Come on, we've gotta get to those balls! [The group rushes into the arena; the guards chase them and open fire]"
214,9,1,Security Guard,[the one who tried to stop them at the door] Stop them! They didn't pay the two-dollar entry fee!
215,9,1,Announcer,"Now substituting for Colorado, number 8, Kyle Broflovski. [Kyle goes in for #11, Owens. Stan and the others run down the steps towards the court, pursued by the guards.]"
216,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh Jesus, he's about to play! [Three of the guards get into position at the top of the stariway aisle and start shooting at them. Down by the court Dr. Biber takes a steel trash can and bashes one guard with it]"
217,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[wrestles another guard over his walker] Mrs. Garrison, grab Kyle!"
218,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"Which one is he?? [camera zooms out to show Colorado taking the ball and driving to the other basket. Kyle isn't seen in the shot. At the other end, Mrs. Garrison tackles a Wyoming player. The crowd gasps]"
219,9,1,Wyoming Coach,"Hey, what the hell?!"
220,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,Stop the game! [jumps high into the air and mows down a bunch of player upon landing. More gasps from the crowd. The loose ball ends up in Kyle's hands]
221,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,I got it! I got the ball. [runs to his basket]
222,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, NO! [Kyle dribbles and then jumps up towards the basket]"
223,9,1,Announcer,Broflovski goes for the dunk!
224,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"NO! [the dunk is shown in smooth slow-motion, as is his next statement] My baaaallllssss. [the ball goes in, Kyle lands back on the floor, his knees bulge, then blow out, spraying testicles matter everywhere. His legs split in two at the knee and he falls backwards. Players on both teams and some of the spectators are hit by bits of testicle. Kyle is unconscious and the Colorado coach screams and runs off]"
225,9,1,Denver Police Officer,So let me get this straight. That woman over there was trying to get to her balls which were in the knees of a black child whose father is a dolphin.
226,9,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's basically it."
227,9,1,Denver Police Officer,"Sounds like an open and shut case. All right, let's head 'em out! [the police leave]"
228,9,1,Dr Biber,"I'm sorry, Kyle, I should have told you the surgery was cosmetic only."
229,9,1,Gerald Broflovski,"So, does this mean I'm not really a dolphin?"
230,9,1,Dr Biber,"Let's get you two up to the clinic and I'll change you back, for a nominal fee."
231,9,1,Kyle Broflovski,But what about Mr. Garrison? He can't go back.
232,9,1,Mrs Garrison,"[thinks about that for a long moment] You know what? I'm okay. Even though I'm not truly a woman, I think I still like the new me. I'd rather be a woman who can't have periods than a fag. [newly confident] Hey guys! This girl is staying a woman! Who wants to pound my vadge! Girl power!"
233,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies."
234,9,2,Elderly Woman,Hippies?
235,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[walks in and begins to rap the walls with his fist] Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies. [raps on the wall and the pitch changes] Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?"
236,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am. [she climbs up until her eyes are level with his] See that? Hippies. [five hippies are sitting in a clearing in the attic, smoking and laughing.]"
237,9,2,Elderly Woman,Oh my.
238,9,2,Eric Cartman,"These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard."
239,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard. [eight hippies are seen seated around a small campfire drumming away. Logs are scattered around them]"
240,9,2,Elderly Woman,"Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but I didn't think they were hurting anything."
241,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony."
242,9,2,Elderly Woman,Oh dear.
243,9,2,Elderly Woman,"Oh, well, so, so what do I do?"
244,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[goes back to rapping the walls, then stops] Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas. [raps again. The wall begins to crack and he steps aside. A hippie breaks through and falls to the floor. Cartman says under his breath] God dammit! [pulls out a fire extinguisher from his backpack]"
245,9,2,Hippie 1,"[dazed and confused, coughing] Whoa, how did I get here? Man, I'm so high."
246,9,2,Eric Cartman,God damn hippie! [opens fire. Foam spews out from the extinguisher]
247,9,2,Hippie 1,"Whoa, dude!"
248,9,2,Eric Cartman,Get out of here!
249,9,2,Hippie 1,Not cool! [stands up and looks at Cartman] What's up?! [runs off]
250,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!"
251,9,2,Elderly Woman,Ooooo...what's that?
252,9,2,Eric Cartman,The college know-it-all hippies.
253,9,2,Driver,"[wearing green jacket] Wow, my friend Brittany was right. This is a really laid-back place."
254,9,2,Woman 1,"[wearing tan jacket] Yeah, this will be a great place to spend spring break. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach them]"
255,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, let's ask them. [the boys are wearing shoulder totes with magazines peeking out from them.]"
256,9,2,Stan Marsh,"All right. [the two parties meet] 'Scuse me. [holds out a clipboard] Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?"
257,9,2,Driver,"Oh wow, you guys shouldn't be doing that. Don't you know what you're doing to the world?"
258,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,Wha- whataya mean?
259,9,2,Man 1,"[wearing a guitar over his back] You're playing into the corporate game! See, the corporations are trying to turn you into little Eichmann's so that they can make money. [the other man is busily eating chips]"
260,9,2,Stan Marsh,Who are the corporations?
261,9,2,Woman 2,[a blonde with a psychedelic fish on her shirt] The corporations run the entire world. And now they fooled you into working for them.
262,9,2,Stan Marsh,Are you serious? We never heard that.
263,9,2,Driver,We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.
264,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh! Those dirty liars!
265,9,2,Kenny McCormick,(Sonofabitch!) [throws down his shoulder tote]
266,9,2,Man 2,[has finished his chips] This is a really nice town you have here. That's why the corporations are trying to use you to take it down.
267,9,2,Stan Marsh,Well... Well what do we do?
268,9,2,Driver,Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told. [Man 2 resumes eating chips]
269,9,2,Hippie 2,[wearing a headband] It is time to let us out! I'm sending your names! Open this door right now!
270,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[opens the door real quick and tosses another hippie down the stairs] All right, in you go."
271,9,2,Hippie 2,"What are you doing, man?!"
272,9,2,Hippie 3,[wearing a V-neck sweater] Let us out! [the throng advances up the stairs]
273,9,2,Eric Cartman,Get back. Get back or you're all gonna get maced! [the throng backs down]
274,9,2,Hippie 2,"What's up, man?! You can't keep us down here like this!"
275,9,2,Hippie 4,[with straight long hair] What's wrong with you?!
276,9,2,Eric Cartman,What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
277,9,2,Hippie 5,[wearing a thin headband] What makes you think you could tell us where to live?!
278,9,2,Hippie 6,"This is a free country, man!"
279,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it."
280,9,2,Hippie 3,Just go with it? We've been down here for days!
281,9,2,Eric Cartman,"And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints [tosses a bunch of joints down to the hippies], and a guitar! [tosses that down as well and shuts the door. He then locks it and sets a large beam across the door, then walks away. The hippies are left there, coughing. One of them takes the guitar and sings]"
282,9,2,Singer,What's goin' on in this world o'mine?There's a whole lot of killin' in this world o'mine. Somebody's gotta help this world o'mine...
283,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Sign, sign everywhere. SignDone something to my mind."
284,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"[peeks out through the sliding doors] Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?"
285,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fat cats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read."
286,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, sweetie."
287,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B."
288,9,2,Chef,"[Secretary of Public Safety] Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!"
289,9,2,Linda Stotch,[City Clerk and Treasurer] We don't have it in the budget to fix them right now.
290,9,2,Gerald Broflovski,[City Attorney] We'll wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands.
291,9,2,Chef,"We- [a struggle is heard in the hall and the council members turn to see what it is. The door opens and Cartman rushes in, roughed up]"
292,9,2,Guard,You can't go in there!
293,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Please, I have to talk to you all right now!"
294,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Kid, we're have a city council meeting."
295,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!"
296,9,2,Randy Marsh,[Secretary of Parks and Public Grounds] What are you talking about?
297,9,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it. [some surprise is seen among the council members] For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town. [puts a laptop on the table and turns it on] At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence. [pulls a projector towards the laptop] Then I saw this... [connects the projector to the laptop, and the projector turns on. Everyone then looks at the screen. Cartman goes to it and points a few things out] Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... [close-up]. hippie music festival."
298,9,2,Linda Stotch,A what?
299,9,2,Eric Cartman,"It's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen. [the adults don't get it, Cartman sighs heavily]"
300,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Kid, what the hell are you talking about?"
301,9,2,Eric Cartman,"I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!"
302,9,2,Mr Mackey,"Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay."
303,9,2,Eric Cartman,It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
304,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Johnson, get him out of here. [Johnson rises and goes for Cartman]"
305,9,2,Eric Cartman,"What are you doing?! [Johnson hauls him away] You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug! [he disappears from view, but peeks in one last time] The town is in serious danger! [Johnson returns to close the door]"
306,9,2,Driver,"You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind."
307,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Right, so how do we get back at them?"
308,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we're pissed off."
309,9,2,Driver,"Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a week long music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down. [foam appears out of nowhere and covers the hippie driver] Whoa, what the hell?! [Cartman appears]"
310,9,2,Eric Cartman,"I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!"
311,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
312,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[stops and thinks through what he just heard, then turns around] Oh Jesus, not you guys? [approaches Stan and checks him out] What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!"
313,9,2,Stan Marsh,[alarmed] NO!
314,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. [the hippie that wore the guitar over his shoulder approaches the boys]"
315,9,2,Man 1,"What is your problem? Get lost, little Eichmann. [Cartman sprays mace on him and he cries out in pain]"
316,9,2,Woman 2,Oh my God!
317,9,2,Man 2,What the hell are you doing?! [a police car pulls up in the background and Officer Barbrady steps out of the car. He comes for Eric]
318,9,2,Eric Cartman,Everybody get in a single-file line!
319,9,2,Officer Barbrady,There you are!
320,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted."
321,9,2,Officer Barbrady,"Eric Cartman, you are under arrest."
322,9,2,Eric Cartman,What?
323,9,2,Officer Barbrady,I was just over at your house and freed sixty-three people you had locked in your basement.
324,9,2,Eric Cartman,"You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!"
325,9,2,Officer Barbrady,"Oh no, you're coming downtown! [hauls Cartman away to the police cruiser]"
326,9,2,Eric Cartman,"No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! [Barbrady puts him in the passenger seat, then gets into the driver's seat and peels away]"
327,9,2,Driver,Who was that?
328,9,2,Eric Cartman,What did I do?!
329,9,2,Officer Barbrady,You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.
330,9,2,Eric Cartman,"They're not people, they're HIPPIES!"
331,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,Is this problem under control?
332,9,2,Officer Barbrady,"I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz."
333,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[walks to his cell door] Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!"
334,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,I know. I signed the permit.
335,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[steps back, stunned] You... You what?"
336,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little ""festival"" should pump some money into our economy."
337,9,2,Eric Cartman,They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!
338,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!
339,9,2,Eric Cartman,You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! [Cartman snaps]
340,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,That kid really needs some psychiatric help.
341,9,2,Officer Barbrady,Yeah.
342,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, let's go."
343,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[quickly composes himself] How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!"
344,9,2,Announcer,This is a South Park News special report! [a crowd scene is shown beside the anchorman]
345,9,2,Anchorman,"Thousands of people have descended on South Park for a hippie music jam festival. The event is said to be the largest such gathering in the history of man. [the crowd scene fills the screen and the MC comes up to the main mic. The stage is set up solidly, with speakers ]"
346,9,2,MC,"All right, welcome to Hippie Jam Fest 2005! [the crowd raises a cheer] Sooo great to see sooo many people turn out to make an impact on on the world! [more cheering follows]"
347,9,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
348,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,You said it!
349,9,2,MC,"For too long, the corporations have bled the world of its love and resources! It is time for us to get to work and make the world a better place! And we're gonna start right now. [launches into a jam with his band. The college hippies are in the audience]"
350,9,2,Man 1,"[coughs] Oh man, I can't wait to see the look on those little Eichmann's faces when they hear this crunchy groove. [goes back to smoking pot]"
351,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, have, have you seen Stan?"
352,9,2,Sharon Marsh,He went with his friends to that music festival.
353,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!"
354,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Randy, we were the same way once, too. Don't forget that we were both considered hippies back in the '60s."
355,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there."
356,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"You ate too much acid, man! [she resumes dancing and slips onto the vomit, face up. Randy pounces on her and starts banging her, sort of. They still have their clothes on.]"
357,9,2,Sharon Marsh,...Oh my God. Our son is with those people.
358,9,2,Randy Marsh,[panics] S-stan. STAAAN!
359,9,2,Announcer,This is South Park News!
360,9,2,Anchorman,Fear and horror in South Park today as the music festival continues to grow. [live footage is shown] They're arriving in droves and apparently no end is in sight.
361,9,2,Reporter,"Tom, the crowd just keeps getting bigger and the town is literally bursting at the seams. We don't know where this music festival came from, but, it's very close to consuming us all."
362,9,2,Linda Stotch,"Steven, what do we do?"
363,9,2,Randy Marsh,"[frantic] Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! [Jimbo approaches him]"
364,9,2,Jimbo Kern,"[restrains Randy] Randy! Randy, you've got to get out of here! If they just trample this park, we'll be trapped! It's too dangerous!"
365,9,2,Randy Marsh,My son is in there! Duh-uh! [breaks away from Jimbo and disappears among the hippies. He reaches a clearing] Stan?! [the marijuana smoke is too much for him. He coughs harshly] Stan! Stan!
366,9,2,Male hippie,"Hey, chill man. It's all good."
367,9,2,Female hippie,Have some water laced with acid.
368,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Sta-ogh. Ugh! [he falls to the ground gagging, then gets into a fetal position and passes out]"
369,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,What have I done?
370,9,2,MC,"Yeah, South Park is now the hippie capital of the world! [a loud cheer rises from the crowd. The Mayor raises her right arm. In her hand is gun. She points it at her temple. the camera moves to the right, the gun goes off, and bits of brain, skull, and blood hit the wall to the right. Her body is heard dropping to the floor]"
371,9,2,Mr Mackey,"Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?"
372,9,2,Eric Cartman,"[gets off his bed] Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it."
373,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?"
374,9,2,Eric Cartman,[angered] Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
375,9,2,Sheila Broflovski,"We we need to take care of them, Eric! They're out of control!"
376,9,2,Eric Cartman,[a bit resentful] Forget it. [turns his back on them and walks back to his bed]
377,9,2,Randy Marsh,Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
378,9,2,Chef,Yeah. We apologize.
379,9,2,Jimbo Kern,Please. Don't let them ruin our town.
380,9,2,Eric Cartman,"It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!"
381,9,2,Mr Mackey,"We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?"
382,9,2,Randy Marsh,"We're just asking you to try. The whole town even got together and, and baked you a cake. [Sheila presents a cake, and Randy helps out. The cake says Eric on it]"
383,9,2,Eric Cartman,[turns away again] Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
384,9,2,Randy Marsh,[thinks a moment] It's yours.
385,9,2,Eric Cartman,I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
386,9,2,Principal Victoria,Fine.
387,9,2,Jimbo Kern,Anything else?
388,9,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. [turns around] Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
389,9,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, we can promise not to buy one for Kyle, but we we can't make him watch you play th- [Rand nudges her hard] Oh yes! Fine! We'll force Kyle to watch you."
390,9,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! [The adults just look back at him]"
391,9,2,Driver,"Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed."
392,9,2,Stan Marsh,So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
393,9,2,Man 1,"[take a deep drag from his joint] Yeah man, the corporations. Right now they're raping the world for money!"
394,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em."
395,9,2,Man 2,Right now we're proving we don't need corporations. We don't need money. This can become a commune where everyone just helps each other.
396,9,2,Man 1,"Yeah, we'll have one guy who like, who like, makes bread. A-and one guy who like, l-looks out for other people's safety."
397,9,2,Stan Marsh,You mean like a baker and a cop?
398,9,2,Man 2,"No no, can't you imagine a place where people live together and like, provide services for each other in exchange for their services?"
399,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's called a town."
400,9,2,Driver,"You kids just haven't been to college yet. But just you wait, this thing is about to get HUGE."
401,9,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick."
402,9,2,Randy Marsh,[closes his eyes] My God...
403,9,2,Eric Cartman,"In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here. [points to the stage] If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system. [shows off a CD-R of Slayer music] Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all."
404,9,2,Jimbo Kern,"Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?"
405,9,2,Eric Cartman,We drill. [flips the page and a blueprint appears.] I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
406,9,2,Steven Stotch,Yuh... actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob? It's a suicide mission!
407,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Not just somebody. I need a complete team to operate this vehicle. Along with me I'm gonna need a scientist, an engineer, and of course, a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong."
408,9,2,Randy Marsh,I'm the... only scientist in town.
409,9,2,Linda Stotch,I'm your engineer.
410,9,2,Steven Stotch,"Honey, no!"
411,9,2,Linda Stotch,"I have to do it, Steven."
412,9,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong. [he looks around, panning by Chef once] Lessee, anyone would do, anyone who meets the qualifications, let's see... [his gaze passes Chef again] Oh, I know. How about- [his gaze falls upon Chef and stays there]"
413,9,2,Chef,"Yeah, yeah! I get it! Fine!"
414,9,2,Steven Stotch,I I can't believe we're actually listening to this. This is a crazy plan!
415,9,2,Randy Marsh,"You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!"
416,9,2,Eric Cartman,"There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we- [his face is distorted. Moments later he sneezes and his face is normal again.] got."
417,9,2,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where a desperate attempt to save the town is underway. Some call it a suicide mission, but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival. [Cartman's team enters through the doors of Bay 2]"
418,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Well I... guess this is it, Sharon."
419,9,2,Sharon Marsh,"Please, save our boy, Randy."
420,9,2,Linda Stotch,"Butters, if anything happens to Mommy, I, I want you to be a good boy."
421,9,2,Butters Stotch,"Ah I will, Mom."
422,9,2,Chef,"[with two ladies crying on his shoulders] Now, now, don't cry, ladies. Everything's gonna be fine."
423,9,2,Eric Cartman,"I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog. [his plush toy sits on a chair] Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. [smiles, wipes a tear from his eye, and joins the rest of the crew into the hippie digger. They turn to wave at the townsfolk, who cheer and wave back. Some people take pictures]"
424,9,2,Sheila Broflovski,Look out for yourselves!
425,9,2,Mrs Garrison,Godspeed! [the crew finally enters the digger and closes the door]
426,9,2,Eric Cartman,Primary engine running?
427,9,2,Randy Marsh,Check.
428,9,2,Eric Cartman,Navigation systems?
429,9,2,Linda Stotch,Online
430,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Let's punch this baby. [the digger rolls off its platform] We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on. [the digger lunges into the crowd, tossing hippies left and right, maybe killing a few in the process. Inside, the crew is jostled about] Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?"
431,9,2,Randy Marsh,Vehicle shell holding! [the digger continues clearing a path towards the stage]
432,9,2,Jimbo Kern,They're in!
433,9,2,Townsfolk,"All right! All right, yeah! We did it!"
434,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,"[appears with a bandage around her head] All right, people, let's save it! [blood stains are seen on the bandage over both temples. The suicide attempt failed] They still have a long way to go!"
435,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!"
436,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,You're doing what?
437,9,2,Guard,"[an old hippie] Hey, you can't go up there. Hoohoo, woo! [smokes his joint. The digger lurches on. A long shot shows the path the digger is taking]"
438,9,2,Eric Cartman,Switching to secondary fuel line. [warning lights begin to flash and warning sounds are heard] What's that?
439,9,2,Randy Marsh,The drill is getting too hot from all the hippies. [the digger stalls and dies]
440,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,What's happened?
441,9,2,Mr Mackey,"They, they s- they stopped. Something's wrong."
442,9,2,Steven Stotch,Jesus... they're dead in the water. [no motion from the digger.] '
443,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing? [the crowd quiets down] It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?"
444,9,2,A hippie,We're using the power of rock and roll to change the world! Woo! [the crowd cheers]
445,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?"
446,9,2,Singer,He's right. It's time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing. [the band starts up again. They missed his point entirely. Stan just turns right and walks away]
447,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Come on, come on!"
448,9,2,Linda Stotch,It's useless. The main power line has been shut down.
449,9,2,Randy Marsh,Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
450,9,2,Eric Cartman,"No, Chef, I'm not gonna let you go out there!"
451,9,2,Chef,...I didn't volunteer!
452,9,2,Eric Cartman,"...All right, fine Chef, go!"
453,9,2,Chef,"...Aw dammit! [rises from his seat and opens the digger door, facing an atmosphere think with marijuana smoke. He climbs down, coughing pretty hard]"
454,9,2,Mayor McDaniels,That's it. We're going to Plan B. Nuke the crowd!
455,9,2,Steven Stotch,God dammit no! Y-you have to give them more time!
456,9,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here."
457,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
458,9,2,Stan Marsh,"What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? [the stage is shown. All of a sudden the digger smashes into it, stopping the festival in its tracks. The crowd looks towards the stage]"
459,9,2,Man 2,"Hey, what happened to the tunes, man?"
460,9,2,Man 1,More tunes. More tunes! [the digger's door opens and the crew steps out]
461,9,2,Linda Stotch,"We made it, We made it!"
462,9,2,Eric Cartman,Hit the PA system NOW! [the crew goes over to it] Put me in the main line! [Randy turns and shoves an unconscious man at the controls off and gathers some cords]
463,9,2,Randy Marsh,Which cord is it?
464,9,2,Eric Cartman,"You're the scientist, jackass!"
465,9,2,Randy Marsh,I'm a geologist!
466,9,2,Linda Stotch,We don't have time to argue! They're gonna nuke us!
467,9,2,Randy Marsh,Nyugh!
468,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Put them in my laptop! [Randy connects one of the cords to the laptop. Cartman selects a song from the Slayer CD he put in the CD-ROM drive: ""Raining Blood"" He clicks ""Play"" and the song blasts forth from the stage speakers. The crowd listens for a while, then begins to disperse.]"
469,9,2,A hippie,"Oh man, not cool."
470,9,2,Hippie 3,[covers his hears and walks off] This music is so angry.
471,9,2,Man 2,This is killing my buzz.
472,9,2,Man 1,Let's bail on this whole angry scene. [the college hippies move off]
473,9,2,Randy Marsh,It's working!
474,9,2,Linda Stotch,What?
475,9,2,Randy Marsh,"It's, it's working!"
476,9,2,Mrs Garrison,We did it! We did it! [the townsfolk cheer and hug each other]
477,9,2,Stan Marsh,Dad!
478,9,2,Randy Marsh,"Stan! [they run up to each other and hug. Nearby, Chef comes to and sits up]"
479,9,2,Chef,"I'm alive! [Kyle walks around aimlessly, but Cartman spots him]"
480,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Hold it right there, Kyle! [Cartman has a small dagger in its sheath. He pulls it out]"
481,9,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, Cartman. We aren't gonna be hippies anymore. Y-you don't have to kill us."
482,9,2,Eric Cartman,Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
483,9,2,Eric Cartman,"Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee! [offers the remote control] Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while. [Kyle rises and takes a few steps, but Cartman withdraws the offer] Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!"
484,9,3,Mrs Garrison,"Children, children, we have a very special announcement. [shown with Token at his side] Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing! Well let's give him a hand! [he claps, and Butters, Annie, and Bebe join him]"
485,9,3,Stan Marsh,Token sings?
486,9,3,Eric Cartman,Of course he sings. He's black.
487,9,3,Mrs Garrison,Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars.
488,9,3,Class,Whoa!
489,9,3,Stan Marsh,Two hundred dollars.
490,9,3,Mrs Garrison,"Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special."
491,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?"
492,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,How come we never get opportunities like that?
493,9,3,Eric Cartman,"You wanna know what it is, guys?"
494,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,We're not talented?
495,9,3,Eric Cartman,"That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side."
496,9,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.
497,9,3,Eric Cartman,"[leaves the table] Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star."
498,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Probably.
499,9,3,Eric Cartman,"So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!"
500,9,3,Stan Marsh,Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
501,9,3,Eric Cartman,"We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. [strokes his chin]"
502,9,3,Stan Marsh,He's looking at the sign.
503,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there."
504,9,3,Stan Marsh,All right.
505,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk."
506,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
507,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit."
508,9,3,Stan Marsh,It's genius.
509,9,3,Eric Cartman,"[motioning them away] Okay, go go, here he comes. [they leave, and he walks into Token's field of view talking into his cell phone] Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested. [stops just before they collide] Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!"
510,9,3,Token Black,Nothin'
511,9,3,Eric Cartman,"[puts his phone away] Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night."
512,9,3,Token Black,Yeah.
513,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you."
514,9,3,Token Black,I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
515,9,3,Eric Cartman,This will only take a second.
516,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm? [they look at the fountains for a few moments, then Cartman turns Token around] Come on over this way, Token. [the other boys come to greet Token] Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client."
517,9,3,Stan Marsh,"[sitting Token down on the sofa] Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man."
518,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?"
519,9,3,Token Black,[Stan and Kyle walk off...] ...Yeah?
520,9,3,Eric Cartman,"[...and reappear on either side of him] Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of. [his phone rings] Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token. [takes the ""call""] Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln? [Token just looks on. Kyle is stunned that Cartman would mention Lincoln, then gets cross about it] Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now."
521,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Can I talk to you?! [grabs Cartman's shoulder]
522,9,3,Eric Cartman,"I'll I'll call you back, Abe. [hangs up. Kyle pulls him behind the partition]"
523,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing?!
524,9,3,Eric Cartman,I'm making it look like important people call us.
525,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
526,9,3,Eric Cartman,[thinks for a moment] ...well Token doesn't know that.
527,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yes he does!
528,9,3,Eric Cartman,How?!
529,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!"
530,9,3,Eric Cartman,Jew! [Stan comes around the corner]
531,9,3,Stan Marsh,"You guys, we're gonna lose our client. [the boys come into view again]"
532,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that. [goes to his desk and clears his throat. Stan and Kyle flank him again] Ah, now, where were we?"
533,9,3,Token Black,We were at why I should give you ten percent.
534,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can."
535,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you."
536,9,3,Stan Marsh,"This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie."
537,9,3,Token Black,"[thinks a moment] Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. [the boys are a bit stunned at how brief and easy this was]"
538,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? [slides the contract towards Token, and Token signs it]"
539,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Welcome to the team, Token."
540,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!"
541,9,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, terrific!)"
542,9,3,Eric Cartman,"From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us."
543,9,3,Miss Colorado Pageant MC,"And there are your finalists, the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado. Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists, the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest, Token Black. [a soul beat comes up and Token walks onto the stage. The crowd cheers him on, he hits his mark and begins to sing]"
544,9,3,Token Black,You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...
545,9,3,Man in Audience,"[""You'll never find...""] Wow, he's really great. We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah [""No matter where you search...""]"
546,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?"
547,9,3,Eric Cartman,"We represent Token. [hands the man a business card] Give us a call, we'll work out a deal."
548,9,3,Token Black,"Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else."
549,9,3,Mrs Garrison,"Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing."
550,9,3,Principal Victoria,"[winces] Mr. Garrison, for the love of God."
551,9,3,Token Black,"... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove."
552,9,3,Stan Marsh,"You were awesome, Token!"
553,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,We knew you could do it!
554,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is..."
555,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Twenty dollars.
556,9,3,Token Black,Here you go. [hands Cartman $20]
557,9,3,Kenny McCormick,(All right!)
558,9,3,Eric Cartman,Sweet!
559,9,3,Stan Marsh,This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
560,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","[walks up to the boys] Hey there my man, that was a great performance."
561,9,3,Token Black,Thanks.
562,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles. I think you've got real promise. How'd you like to sign with CAA?"
563,9,3,Token Black,Are you serious?
564,9,3,Stan Marsh,"[interjecting] Uh excuse me, Token already has representation."
565,9,3,Eric Cartman,You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
566,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Mm, no. Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away. If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through."
567,9,3,Token Black,Oh my God! Okay!
568,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Token, you signed with us!"
569,9,3,Token Black,"Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me."
570,9,3,Eric Cartman,What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
571,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Actually, our fountain is two stories tall."
572,9,3,Eric Cartman,...Oooo...
573,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about."
574,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Mister, you can't do this to us!"
575,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know? [Token goes into the limo and takes a seat. Don follows him in] Do you like steak, Token? I know a great place for you locally. [the limo rolls off]"
576,9,3,Eric Cartman,...Goddamnit! [throws down the $20 bill]
577,9,3,Stan Marsh,So unfair... so unfair.
578,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
579,9,3,Eric Cartman,"This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! [Tuong Li Kim comes into view, climbing down the stairs]"
580,9,3,Mr Kim,"Ahh hello, is this the Talent Agency"
581,9,3,Stan Marsh,Huh?
582,9,3,Mr Kim,"I see this sign on the street for a talent agency? I need a representation. [the boys all perk up and look at Lu Kim, then jump at the chance to get a new client] Hey, wowee, nice fountain."
583,9,3,Stan Marsh,You were looking for a talent agent?
584,9,3,Mr Kim,"No, not me, my wife. [calls her down the stairs. She dutifully appears] This is Wing. She just come over from China. [puts his right hand on to the left side of his face so she doesn't hear] She over here uh irregarry. The Chinese Mafia help me out."
585,9,3,Stan Marsh,And what does she do?
586,9,3,Mr Kim,"Ah, she sing. She very popular in China. Hey, you just sit and listen. You'll be very impressed. [he barks commands at her, then goes over to a tape player, puts a tape in, and waits for Wing to sing. The boys take seats at a row of chairs nearby. Wing begins a bad rendition of ABBA's Dancing Queen] Well? What you think?"
587,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us."
588,9,3,Mr Kim,"Aww, that's too bad. She just got accepted to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres, but I can't take her 'cause I have to mind the restaurant. [the boys think, then blink]"
589,9,3,Eric Cartman,You've ...already done all the work?
590,9,3,Mr Kim,Yes. They say it pays a thousand dowar.
591,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Sir, we would love to sign your wife."
592,9,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
593,9,3,Mr Kim,Rearry?
594,9,3,Eric Cartman,"We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. [Wing continues singing]"
595,9,3,Mr Kim,"Shitty Wok, take your order prease."
596,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?"
597,9,3,Mr Kim,"Oh, don't worry about her. She a very dericate little flower. See, she don't need to eat much."
598,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV."
599,9,3,Mr Kim,"Okay, bye. Oh oh wait! Can I talk to my wife, please?"
600,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh sure, here she is. [Stan puts the phone to Wing's ear, and Mr. Kim begins barking at her again] Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family. [outside there's a flash of light and three shadows pass through the doors] Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease? [the men come into the light. They are three buff Chinese men] Aw crap, Chinese Mafia! [one of the men walks around behind the counter, grabs Mr. Kim's head with one hand and places a knife against his chin with the other] Aaaaahh! [the two men move around to the eating area and are met by four other Tong members]"
601,9,3,Tong Leader,"Mr. Ru Kim, it appears we have a problem."
602,9,3,Mr Kim,"Oh, a problem? Rearry?"
603,9,3,Tong Leader,"We smuggled your wife into the United States for you. You were to pay us ten thousand dollars for that service. Yet, we have yet to be paid."
604,9,3,Mr Kim,"We... we working on it! She, she got tarent agent! She's about to make a whole lotta money!"
605,9,3,Tong Leader,"It's too late for that, Mr. Kim. Your wife is now our property. We taking her to Los Angeles, where she will work in massage parlor.until she works off the debt."
606,9,3,Mr Kim,"No, she... she not here! Prease, just give me a little more time! [the leader punches him in the face] Agh!"
607,9,3,Tong Leader,Where is she?!
608,9,3,Mr Kim,She... she in Arabama.
609,9,3,Tong Leader,You're lying. Turn him around!
610,9,3,Mr Kim,"Yah, wah, aaaah!"
611,9,3,Tong Leader,You don't wanna tell us where she is? All right. Puh la! Ching ga wai pan! [one of the men begins to grab trays of food and dumps the first one over the counter]
612,9,3,Mr Kim,"Ahhh! My shitty chicken! [the man grabs the next tray and dumps that over the counter] Nooo, the shitty beef! [the man grabs the next tray...] No! No wait! Prease! Stop! Prease! Not the shitty shrimp."
613,9,3,Tong Leader,"Tell us where to find her, Ru Kim! You have no choice."
614,9,3,Mr Kim,"She... she go to Ros Angeres with her agents! She gonna be American Idol. [the leader snaps his fingers, the other men let him go, and they all leave. Mr. Kim collapses on the floor sobbing]"
615,9,3,Stan Marsh,There it is! American Idol contestants!
616,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, we made it just in time! [the boys attempt to talk to the attendants]"
617,9,3,Eric Cartman,Excuse us!
618,9,3,Contestant,"Hey kid, what do you think you're doing? [the boys turn to face him]"
619,9,3,Stan Marsh,Ah our client has an audition to this show.
620,9,3,Contestant,Yeah. So do we! [the camera pulls back to show the long line of contestants waiting for their auditions]
621,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh crap!
622,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, how long is the wait?"
623,9,3,Contestant 2,It's been about seventeen days for me.
624,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, no no no, come on! [the boys return to the attendants] Excuse me, ma'am."
625,9,3,Attendant,Wait in line with everyone else. [turns away]
626,9,3,Stan Marsh,"No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. [the woman]"
627,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-"
628,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone. [clears his throat and whips out his phone] Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is."
629,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, just forget it! [hauls Cartman away. The other boys follow, but Wing doesn't]"
630,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken."
631,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
632,9,3,Stan Marsh,We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
633,9,3,Eric Cartman,Stupid assholes! [they pass an agent talking on a cell phone]
634,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent",What do you mean your client isn't coming?! We're taping the show tomorrow! Where am I goin' to find another contestant? Fine! Go screw yourself!
635,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?"
636,9,3,Stan Marsh,We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
637,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent",Really?
638,9,3,Eric Cartman,Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
639,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Well yeah, winner gets a thousand dollars."
640,9,3,Stan Marsh,"All right, our client will do it!"
641,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent",Great! You kids just saved my ass! See you over at Stage 6. [moves off.]
642,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?"
643,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Naw, this is better. It's called The Contender. [gets into a cart and drives off.]"
644,9,3,Stan Marsh,"What's ""The Contender""?"
645,9,3,Announcer,"Tonight, two people will compete for glory. One will stay, one will go home, in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone."
646,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,Hello.
647,9,3,Announcer,The Contender!
648,9,3,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender! Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico, Manuelo Furrrrnanda! [Furnanda dances and jabs at the air, then raises his arms. Mexican fans in the audience cheer him on]"
649,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,"[at ringside, slurred speech] Le's go! Le's see a good fight!"
650,9,3,Announcer,"And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!"
651,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Wing!"
652,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Let's do it Wing!
653,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Go Wing! [Kenny cheers on as well, but he's hard to understand. The bell rings. Wing's music comes up and she begins to sing ""Fernando"" as Fernanda sizes her up]"
654,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,Aw yeah! [Fernanda begins to deliver blows to Wing and the boys wince]
655,9,3,The Boys,Awww! [Fernanda delivers more blows]
656,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, dude!"
657,9,3,Eric Cartman,"She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. [Fernanda delivers more blows until Wing is knocked out and falls to the side]"
658,9,3,The Boys,[wincing] Awww! [Kenny draws his hood string tight around his face]
659,9,3,Eric Cartman,Gay.
660,9,3,Stan Marsh,Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
661,9,3,Eric Cartman,Your gift of hope is a great deduction. [no one stops to donate. Stallone and his producers come out and approach the boys]
662,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,Hey kid! [Stan and Cartman turn around and he mumbles at them]
663,9,3,Producer,Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
664,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, thanks."
665,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,Yo kid. [mumbles some more]
666,9,3,Producer,"Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent. [Stallone mumbles some more] He really likes her voice. [Stallone mumbles some more] You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, [Stallone mumbles some more] it brings tears to his eyes."
667,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. [Stallone mumbles some more]"
668,9,3,Producer,"Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding."
669,9,3,Stan Marsh,You do? [Stallone mumbles some more]
670,9,3,Producer,He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
671,9,3,Eric Cartman,Four thousand dollars? [Stallone mumbles some more and hands his producer a card]
672,9,3,Producer,[hands the card to Stan] Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.
673,9,3,Stan Marsh,"We won't! [Stallone mumbles some more, then leaves with his men]"
674,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Waaaaah! [they run over to Kyle and Kenny, who have their own cups]"
675,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Waaaaah! [they run over to Kyle and Kenny, who have their own cups]"
676,9,3,Stan Marsh,"You guys, you guys!"
677,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,What?
678,9,3,Stan Marsh,Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
679,9,3,Kenny McCormick,(What?!)
680,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Get out!
681,9,3,Eric Cartman,That's four hundred for us! We did it! [tosses his cup away]
682,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Woohoo! Yeah!
683,9,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
684,9,3,Eric Cartman,Who let the dogs out?
685,9,3,The Boys,[dancing in pairs] Who? Who? Who who?
686,9,3,Eric Cartman,Who let the dogs out?
687,9,3,The Boys,Who? Who? Who who?
688,9,3,Eric Cartman,Who let-?
689,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? [the joy leaves instantly]"
690,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
691,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Naw, sh-she was with you!"
692,9,3,Stan Marsh,"...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again."
693,9,3,Eric Cartman,[move forward] Wing? Wing?
694,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wing?
695,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Wing? Here, Wing!"
696,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wing?
697,9,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Wing?) [nearby, the Tong have arrived and abducted Wing]"
698,9,3,Tong Leader,"You thought you could run from us, did you? [the boys look around, and Stan spots her]"
699,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh no! [he points towards Wing, who's now being put into a limousine. The boys race over] Hey! That's our client! [the driver gets into the limo and drives off]"
700,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
701,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back."
702,9,3,Tong Leader,"[in one of the rooms] You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away. Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves. It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us. [guards outside the house arm themselves]"
703,9,3,Stan Marsh,"[walking up the driveway with his friends] Two four nine all right, this is the place."
704,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn, CAA is pretty impressive."
705,9,3,Eric Cartman,Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
706,9,3,Guard 1,"[says something in Chinese. Translations follow] ""It's just four little boys"" [the second guard says something to the boys as they walk up the stairs and pass through the front doors]"
707,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls."
708,9,3,Stan Marsh,Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
709,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys. Look! [they face a two-story-tall fountain with a curving stairway on each side] They do have an amazing fountain. [four guards appear and run down one of the staircases, getting into positions]"
710,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
711,9,3,Stan Marsh,"You tell 'em, Kyle!"
712,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! [the four guards open fire. the boys look for a place to hide and find shelter behind a counter.]"
713,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!"
714,9,3,Tong Leader,[hears the commotion nearby] What the hell is that?! Go! Go! [sends the guards with him out]
715,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, maybe we should give up!"
716,9,3,Stan Marsh,"No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!"
717,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! [leaves the counter]"
718,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman! [Cartman runs through the gunfire and makes it to a wall on which rest several guns. He takes one and cocks it. The four guards move down to the floor]
719,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Do you wanna play rough?! Okay! [comes out from behind the wall] Take this! [begins firing away. He has no control over the gun, so it fires everywhere. One of the guards is struck down, another one quickly goes up the stairs again]"
720,9,3,Stan Marsh,"We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! [Kyle and Kenny move away from the gunfire, Stan goes towards Cartman. Kyle and Kenny enter a blue room]"
721,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wing?
722,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,[pulls out a yellow toy car] Stupid talent agents!
723,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[stirs] All right, Kenny, let's go! [stops when nothing happens, then looks] Kenny? [the camera pulls back to show Kenny, shot up and bleeding, dead on the floor] Kenny! [walks over to Kenny with his arms open] Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing. [hugs Kenny, sobbing] We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!"
724,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,They killed Kenny!
725,9,3,Stan Marsh,You bastards!
726,9,3,Tong Leader,Enough! [comes into view with a gun to Wing's head] I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
727,9,3,Eric Cartman,Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
728,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!"
729,9,3,Tong Leader,This woman has a contract with us! We own her!
730,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,She had a contract with us first! We own her!
731,9,3,Tong Leader,Her life belongs to us!
732,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Her life belongs to us!
733,9,3,Stan Marsh,"[intervening] Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of."
734,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
735,9,3,Stan Marsh,Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
736,9,3,Tong Leader,"[releases his grip on Wing and lowers his gun] Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings."
737,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
738,9,3,Tong Leader,[sighs deeply and turns around] I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business.
739,9,3,Stan Marsh,It's a lousy business. I quit.
740,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
741,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw aw guys, come on!"
742,9,3,Tong Leader,"We quit too. [his guards lower their weapons] It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void."
743,9,3,Stan Marsh,All right!
744,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,All right!
745,9,3,Producer,"[interpreting] Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing! [cheers and applause as she takes the stage to sing ""Sing A Song""]"
746,9,3,"Wing Han Tsang, Special Guest Star","Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long..."
747,9,3,Mr Kim,"[seated at a table with the Tong leader and the boys] Boys, thank you so much for eveything. You rearry helped us out."
748,9,3,Tong Leader,"Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful. [""Don't worry if it's not good enough...""] To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing. [""...for anyone else to hear.""]"
749,9,3,Stan Marsh,"I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. [""Just sing..."" Token appears in the background]"
750,9,3,Token Black,"Send a cress in your plates, folks? [""Sing a song...""]"
751,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,[notices] Token?
752,9,3,Token Black,"[notices] Oh... Hey guys. [walks up to the table] What, what are you doin' here?"
753,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Token, you're... waiting tables?"
754,9,3,Token Black,"Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you. [""Sing, sing a song""] I'm trying to work my way back home."
755,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! [""make it simple, to last your whole life long."" Token walks off ]"
756,9,3,Tong Leader,"My God, her voice is sooo beautiful! [""Don't worry if it's not good enough...""]"
757,9,3,Mr Kim,"Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower. [""for anyone else to hear."" gets up and screams at her]"
758,9,3,"Wing Han Tsang, Special Guest Star","Sing, sing a song."
759,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go! [moves to the foot of the bed] MOM, GET UP!"
760,9,4,Liane Cartman,"[sits up, feeling sleepy] Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early."
761,9,4,Eric Cartman,"[goes to the other side of the bed and draws close to her face] Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one! [turns on her light] Come on! [goes back to the door]"
762,9,4,Liane Cartman,"[still sleepy] Sweetie, can't we go after school?"
763,9,4,Eric Cartman,Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
764,9,4,Eric Cartman,I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry! [they pull up to the curb and stop. Cartman gets out of the car] WHAT THE HELL?!
765,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, when did you get here?"
766,9,4,Kenny McCormick,[looks at his watch](Friday)
767,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Friday?! Aw, Jesus! [he switches tactics] I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. [gets in line between Kenny and the Goth Kids]"
768,9,4,Tall Goth,Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing?
769,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line."
770,9,4,Sixth Grader,"There's no saving place, fourthie! Get to the back or we'll beat your face in!"
771,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Goddammit! [moves to the back of the line] They'd better not sell out!"
772,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
773,9,4,Stan Marsh,"[answering for Kenny] It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan. [Cartman walks up to the other boys, but he's quite upset. He crosses his arms] Dude, you see what Kenny got?"
774,9,4,Eric Cartman,"YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE! [Cartman folds his arms]"
775,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Wuh what'd I do?
776,9,4,Eric Cartman,JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!!!
777,9,4,Game Voice,"""Congratulations! You have reached ...level nine!"""
778,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell."""
779,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at."
780,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing? [Yep] Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!"
781,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(I could get to level sixty!)
782,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!"
783,9,4,Stuart McCormick,"[offscreen] Hey, I heard that, bitch!"
784,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!! [Kenny leaves, having tuned her out all the while]"
785,9,4,Stuart McCormick,[offscreen] How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
786,9,4,Mrs McCormick,I'd like to see you try!
787,9,4,Stuart McCormick,"Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!"
788,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"It's my house too, you no-good loser!"
789,9,4,Game Voice,You have reached level sixty!
790,9,4,Kenny McCormick,"[starts jumping around excited] (Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) [an ice-cream truck runs over him. The driver misses this, as he's playing on his own PSP]"
791,9,4,Driver,"Oh yeah, level four, sweet!"
792,9,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, that's odd.) [He rises up in the air.] (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) [he then speaks too fast to decipher, but he toes towards heaven.]"
793,9,4,Angel 1,Open the gate!
794,9,4,Angel 2,Open the gate! [the gates open and an elderly man walks towards Kenny. Kenny shields his eyes from the bright rays.]
795,9,4,Peter,"Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter."
796,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(What the fuck is going on?)
797,9,4,Peter,"There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you."
798,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(Me?)
799,9,4,Peter,"Come! There is much to discuss. [they both enter and behold a gleaming city on a hill. Inside, the city has all the appearance of a super-basilica, built with gold and marble. Angels flit around doing stuff] Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven. [they pass the Mormons, who greet them] But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command."
800,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(That I what?)
801,9,4,Peter,"The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe."
802,9,4,Angel 3,"Satan's army grows as we speak. The Dark Lord knows that our armies are few in number, and unorganized. So our only hope... is perfect strategy. [steps aside to show Kenny off]"
803,9,4,Angel 4,A child? This is God's solution?
804,9,4,Peter,He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations.
805,9,4,Angel 4,"Archangel Michael, what say you?"
806,9,4,Archangel Michael,"[looks out into space, then turns around] The child did something none of us could: Reach level sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverance, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against. [two other angels roll a chalkboard to him, and he begins drawing up strategies.] This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more. [sniffs the fumes from the Sharpie] Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong. [sniffs again] We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can single handedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves. [Kenny just sits there.]"
807,9,4,Satan,My fellow damned souls! Now is the time for our assault! [with him is a small hooded figure] You know no fear! You will drink the blood of angels! We go now! Nothing can stop us!
808,9,4,Angel 5,"Step aside! Step aside, I say! [stops when he sees Satan] Satan! God has mocked thee once again!"
809,9,4,Satan,My spy!
810,9,4,Angel 5,God has found a way to defeat your army.
811,9,4,Satan,Impossible! How?!
812,9,4,Angel 5,"A young man. Basically, he-he's like Keanu Reeves."
813,9,4,Satan,[slumps down in his throne] Oh Jesus Christ.
814,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now!"
815,9,4,Satan,What's the point?! They have a Keanu Reeves now.
816,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","Do not fear, my Lord. Your army is great!"
817,9,4,Satan,"Very well. [rises and addresses his army] Demon Army, begin your march on Heaven! [a loud roar comes up from the army]"
818,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven."
819,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)
820,9,4,Angel 6,Simple. You will use... this. [bows towards a chair and backs off. A golden PSP descends onto the chair]
821,9,4,Archangel Michael,[gets the PSP and shows it to Kenny] This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.
822,9,4,Angels,Hail the holy PSP.
823,9,4,Archangel Michael,"It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals."
824,9,4,Angel 7,Gabriel returns with news!
825,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven.
826,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Prepare the troops! [the angels take off] We must be ready for them! [walks up to Kenny] The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands. [Kenny vanishes. The angels notice] Where'd he go?"
827,9,4,Female Nurse,"Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!"
828,9,4,The Doctor,Then that's it! We brought him back.
829,9,4,Male Nurse,"Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day!"
830,9,4,The Doctor,Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive.
831,9,4,The Doctor,It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again.
832,9,4,Stuart McCormick,"It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive."
833,9,4,The Doctor,"I'm afraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a ""persistent vegetative state."""
834,9,4,Mrs McCormick,Will he ever recover?
835,9,4,The Doctor,"I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaired once dead. But his soul is still in here. [places his hand on Kenny's chest] Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato."
836,9,4,Stuart McCormick,He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?
837,9,4,The Doctor,A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomach. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years.
838,9,4,Archangel Michael,[reading a scroll] A feeding tube?!
839,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive.
840,9,4,Archangel Michael,But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!
841,9,4,Angel 3,The child's soul is now trapped inside his vegetative body. We have no one to command the troops with the PSP.
842,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,And Satan's armies are approaching.
843,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Oh, Goddammit."
844,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice. [the boys are shocked]
845,9,4,Stan Marsh,Are we in trouble or something?
846,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will."
847,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny had a will?
848,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"[clears his throat] ""In the highly likely event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have."""
849,9,4,Stan Marsh,Oh wow...
850,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's... really touching.
851,9,4,Eric Cartman,(looking bored) Fags!
852,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"To Eric Cartman: ""Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP."""
853,9,4,Eric Cartman,"[suddenly excited and cocky] Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?"
854,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,... [Cartman is still dancing. The lawyer reaches the last page and... can't fine it]"
855,9,4,Stan Marsh,Please what?
856,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,I don't know. I lost the last page.
857,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Who cares? Kenny's dead! [rushes up to the lawyer's desk] When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?"
858,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"[pulls up a box from nowhere and puts it on his desk] It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours."
859,9,4,Eric Cartman,[salivating] Yes!
860,9,4,Man,[enters the office] He's alive!
861,9,4,Stan Marsh,What?
862,9,4,Man,Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital! [leaves]
863,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God! [he and Stan rush out of there, leaving Cartman incredulous]"
864,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","Your army nears the Kingdom of Heaven, my Lord."
865,9,4,Satan,I don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has.
866,9,4,Spy Angel,Satan! I come bearing good news! The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven.
867,9,4,Satan,"[whispers] Then God is helpless. [aloud] Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!"
868,9,4,Stan Marsh,Kenny?
869,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! You're alive!
870,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, how'd you do that?"
871,9,4,The Doctor,"He can't respond to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain."
872,9,4,Eric Cartman,Well... well then he's NOT alive.
873,9,4,Mrs McCormick,He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...
874,9,4,Eric Cartman,"That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look. [climbs onto Kenny's bed and holds out a $1 bill] Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?"
875,9,4,Stuart McCormick,I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.
876,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, the lawyer lost that page."
877,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube."
878,9,4,Mrs McCormick,He did? When?
879,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Um, it was um, this one time..."
880,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
881,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Stupid? PSP is stupid?! [steps forth] Did you all hear that? [steps back to his little group] Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!"
882,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,He did not!
883,9,4,Eric Cartman,Did so!
884,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Did not!
885,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew! [moves towards the door] I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! [runs out]"
886,9,4,Peter,Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!
887,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP.
888,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel",No! There is another. A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine.
889,9,4,Archangel Michael,"[thinks for a moment] Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls!"
890,9,4,Angel 9,Yeah
891,9,4,Angel 1,Yeah
892,9,4,Angel 11,Yeah
893,9,4,Angel 12,"Yeah, Uriel!"
894,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","Oh, right right, I'm sorry"
895,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do. [walks up to the chalkboard and starts writing] Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime [sniffs those Sharpie fumes] we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Army from breaking through as long as possible. [sniffs those Sharpie fumes] Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back."
896,9,4,Eric Cartman,"You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right."
897,9,4,Chief Justice,"Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here."
898,9,4,Eric Cartman,"I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF."
899,9,4,Judge 2,Best friends forever?
900,9,4,Eric Cartman,"That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look. [brings forth a necklace with the left half of a BFF heart medallion] Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is."
901,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again."
902,9,4,The Doctor,[entering with a policeman] But this just doesn't seem right.
903,9,4,Stuart McCormick,"Wha, what's the matter, doctor?"
904,9,4,The Doctor,I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube.
905,9,4,Mrs McCormick,What?
906,9,4,Eric Cartman,[comes in with the Chief Justice] He's right in here.
907,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
908,9,4,Chief Justice,Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish.
909,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
910,9,4,Police Officer,"Sir, take a look at this. [has Kenny's necklace in hand and points to the other half of the BFF medallion. the justice walks over the officer puts the two halves together]"
911,9,4,Chief Justice,"[steps back] That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor."
912,9,4,Mrs McCormick,No doctor! You can't!
913,9,4,The Doctor,I'm sorry. I have no choice. [pulls the tube and drops it on the floor]
914,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Here is the hospital
915,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","[the blonde angel without a shirt] This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed?"
916,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,[exiting the hospital with Stan] That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
917,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! [they walk through the angels, then the angels turn around]"
918,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,The tube has been removed?
919,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
920,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us."
921,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time.
922,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!"
923,9,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
924,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,No!
925,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny."
926,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, come on! [grabs Kyle and they go away]"
927,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","No! No, no boys! Aw Goddammit! [the angels follow]"
928,9,4,HBC Anchor,"This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate is heating up in Colorado, [Kenny is shown] where Kenny McCormick's feeding tube has been removed by his BFF. [a choked-up Cartman shows his half of the BFF medallion] Two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital."
929,9,4,Stan Marsh,Don't kill Kenny!
930,9,4,All,You bastards!
931,9,4,Stan Marsh,Don't kill Kenny!
932,9,4,All,You bastards!
933,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","[drifting through the crowd] No! No, they're not killing him, they're letting him die!"
934,9,4,Skeeter,You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!
935,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,"Nono, see, they were playing God when they put the feeding tube IN!"
936,9,4,HBC Anchor,A woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient. [Two officers haul Mrs. Garrison out of the emergency room]
937,9,4,Mrs Garrison,Get your man-hands off of me!
938,9,4,HBC Anchor,"However, a growing number of people are also standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman."
939,9,4,Man 1,"[in a crowd of people wearing BFF chains] We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless"
940,9,4,Man 2,"We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority."
941,9,4,Eric Cartman,That's right. Respect our authoritah.
942,9,4,Satan,What mockery is this?!
943,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",My Lord...
944,9,4,Satan,"The feeding tube has been pulled! If the child dies and his soul returns to Heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves!"
945,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",Perhaps the child won't die in time.
946,9,4,Satan,Forget it! I'm calling the attack off!
947,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","No! Keep your army marching, my Lord. I will get that feeding tube put back in. [turns and walks off]"
948,9,4,Satan,How?
949,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans.
950,9,4,George Bush,We Republicans are deeply saddened by the tragic events in Colorado. [the crowd cheers]
951,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","[appears and whispers into Bush's right ear] Removing the feeding tube is murder, hughughughughughugh..."
952,9,4,George Bush,Removing the feeding tube is murder!
953,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",[whispers into Bush's left ear] Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?
954,9,4,George Bush,Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?
955,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",[whispers into Bush's right ear] It is God's will that he live!
956,9,4,George Bush,It is God's will that he LIVE! [the hooded figure hisses into Bush's left ear] Haaghaghaghaghaghagha...
957,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","No no, you don't say that part. [hisses into Bush's right ear]"
958,9,4,George Bush,"No no, you don't say that part, haghaghaghagha. [the crowd looks at him in stunned silence]"
959,9,4,Angel 9,"Jesus, their army is massive."
960,9,4,Angel 1,Heaven help us.
961,9,4,HBC Anchor,The biggest battle of all time is about to begin: the battle of the feeding tube! As people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention.
962,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!"
963,9,4,Eric Cartman,I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
964,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You say tomato, but I say Kenny!"
965,9,4,Eric Cartman,"You say Kenny, but I say tomato! [both sides yell at each other]"
966,9,4,Cartman s Side,Tomato!
967,9,4,Kyle s Side,Kenny! Kenny!
968,9,4,Cartman s Side,Tomato!
969,9,4,Judge,"[The executioner of Kenny's will] Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found the last page of Kenny's will. [Everyone quiets down]"
970,9,4,Eric Cartman,What?
971,9,4,Judge,I found the page where Kenny specified his wishes about being on life support.
972,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, what does it say?"
973,9,4,Judge,"[clears his throat] If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life support, please... [flips to the last page] for the love of God, don't ever show me in that condition on national television. [not a word is uttered for a few seconds]"
974,9,4,Stan Marsh,Oooo.
975,9,4,Man,Oowhoops
976,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace."
977,9,4,Stan Marsh,"You mean, Cartman's side is right?"
978,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons."
979,9,4,Both sides,Yeah.
980,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. [everyone walks out.]"
981,9,4,HBC Anchor,"We've just received word that Kenny McCormick... has passed away. The debate still rages on in America, but at least now, Kenny... is in a much more peaceful place."
982,9,4,Angel 11,The armies of Satan have already broken through the gate!
983,9,4,Angel 12,We're gonna die!!!
984,9,4,Archangel Michael,Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can!
985,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Michael! Michael! [he and Uriel bring Kenny to Michael] The humans finally did the right thing!
986,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry! [Uriel and Gabriel sit Kenny down and strap him in] Satan's army charges! Tell our troops what to do, Kenny! [Kenny sets to work on the Golden PSP, manning the controls like a pro] So it begins. [Gabriel and Uriel leave Kenny to his task and fly off. The camera focuses on Michael] Now we shall see the final battle between Heaven and Hell play out! [Kenny continues playing, and Michael provides commentary] Yesss, good, Kenny! The angel spearmen are taking out their demon soul rippers! Oh, the cavalry angels are clashing with their Black Knights! Oh my God! My God, this battle is epic! Ohh, they're bringing in their demon dragons! Look at the size of them! My God, this is even bigger than the final battle in the Lord of the Rings movie! It's like, it's like TEN times bigger than that battle!"
987,9,4,Satan,No! NO! How are we losing?! [the spy angel returns]
988,9,4,Spy Angel,The child's soul is in Heaven! God has his secret weapon!
989,9,4,Satan,Full retreat!
990,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","Patience, my Lord!"
991,9,4,Satan,"No, Kevin! [turns and glares at him] That's it! I'm breaking up with you! [one blast from his eyes and Kevin is dead]"
992,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Yesss. Yes, Kenny! Satan's forces are retreating! This is TRULY a sight to behold! OH I wish I had a camcorder! [Kenny continues to play] We have done it! We have defeated the armies of Satan! [the angels in the battlefield look around and celebrate weakly. The angels then gather around Kenny, and Peter joins them.]"
993,9,4,Peter,Kenny! Bless your soul! You've saved all of Heaven!
994,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Yes, Kenny! And to thank you for all you've done, we are going to give you a very special gift. For saving the entire universe from the forces of evil, we give you this. [two angels haul something into view] Keanu Reeves' statue. [a ten-foot statue of Keanu Reeves on a three-foot base] Congratulations. [everyone claps for him]"
995,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[infield, right] This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home."
996,9,5,Local Announcer 1,Now batting for Conifer is little Allen Varcas. [Allen gets ready to swing]
997,9,5,Randy Marsh,Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
998,9,5,Mr Varcas,"Hit it out of the park, Allen! South Park sucks!"
999,9,5,Mr Donovan,"[Clyde's Dad] Just look at those boys out there, lovin' the great game of baseball like we did when we were kids. [sips]"
1000,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw God, I'm so borrred. [Token yawns over at first base]"
1001,9,5,Butters Stotch,"I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug. [Stan simple stretches out his left arm and catches the ball, then pitches it to Alan. Alan swings and misses]"
1002,9,5,Umpire,Strike.
1003,9,5,Mr Varcas,"That was no strike! What the hell is wrong with you, ref?"
1004,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Good call, ref! Good call!"
1005,9,5,Mr Varcas,"Come on, Allen! This pitcher throws like a girl!"
1006,9,5,Randy Marsh,What'd you say?!
1007,9,5,Mr Varcas,"You heard me, asshole!"
1008,9,5,Randy Marsh,You want me to kick your ass right here?! [Mr. Barkas stands and looks at him]
1009,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, sit down."
1010,9,5,Mr Varcas,You want a piece of me?! 'Cause I'm pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth!
1011,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[takes off his shirt and throws it aside and challengers] Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?"
1012,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, don't!"
1013,9,5,Mr Varcas,"You'd better shut up, asshole!"
1014,9,5,Randy Marsh,I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
1015,9,5,Mr Varcas,I told you to SHUT UP! [throws his beer at Randy. Randy takes his beer and throws it at Mr. Barkas. They start fighting back and forth. Stan looks on from the pitcher's mound]
1016,9,5,Stan Marsh,"[turns away and hides his face in his right hand] Aw Jesus, not again."
1017,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! [Stan puts on his game face and throws the pitch. Alan swings and misses]"
1018,9,5,Umpire,Strike three! You're out!
1019,9,5,Stan Marsh,Yes! It's over! It's over!
1020,9,5,Local Announcer 1,That's it. South Park wins the game 4 to 0.
1021,9,5,Eric Cartman,[runs to the mound] We're done! No more baseball!
1022,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,No more boring baseball until next year!
1023,9,5,Stan Marsh,We can start having fun again! [falls to the ground and rolls around]
1024,9,5,Eric Cartman,"All right, we did it! [the rest of the team shows up and celebrates]"
1025,9,5,Stan Marsh,We did it! We did it!
1026,9,5,Steven Stotch,"[as the coach, arrives] Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're going to the finals! Woohoo! [the boys stop cheering and look at him]"
1027,9,5,Stan Marsh,... What?
1028,9,5,Steven Stotch,Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division! [the parents rush onto the field]
1029,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!"
1030,9,5,Eric Cartman,Post-season?
1031,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody said anything about a post-season.
1032,9,5,Anchorman Tom,[Craig's Dad] There's more little-league baseball for South Park! Yehheah! [the adults begin celebrating while the kids are dumb-struck]
1033,9,5,Stan Marsh,No... NOOO!!
1034,9,5,Randy Marsh,"This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! [he's put into the back seat]"
1035,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
1036,9,5,Eric Cartman,Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
1037,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad."
1038,9,5,Craig Tucker,Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!
1039,9,5,Stan Marsh,"I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over."
1040,9,5,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, but... we usually win."
1041,9,5,Craig Tucker,All the other teams are worse than us.
1042,9,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners."
1043,9,5,Stan Marsh,I know we can lose if we try.
1044,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport."
1045,9,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. My dad always said ""It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."""
1046,9,5,The other boys,"Yeah, uh huh."
1047,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know."
1048,9,5,Butters Stotch,"We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!"
1049,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!"
1050,9,5,Mr Donovan,"Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em! [the doors open and Randy walks in]"
1051,9,5,Randy Marsh,Heeey!
1052,9,5,Men,Heeey!
1053,9,5,Steven Stotch,You're out. [hands Randy a beer]
1054,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,How much was bail this time? [hands Randy a beer]
1055,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Hundred bucks, no big whoop."
1056,9,5,Mr. Richard Tweek,"[Tweek's dad] Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad."
1057,9,5,Randy Marsh,Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
1058,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs."
1059,9,5,Randy Marsh,Wha-what do you mean?
1060,9,5,Steven Stotch,"I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough!"
1061,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious."
1062,9,5,Randy Marsh,I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
1063,9,5,DJ,...the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay- [Randy clicks the radio off]
1064,9,5,FC Announcer,"We want to welcome all South Park parents to Fort Collins, and the Little League Division One Playoffs. [applause all around as the teams meet on the field]"
1065,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh, [pulls out a yellow sheet of paper] here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order."
1066,9,5,FC Team,Ooooo!
1067,9,5,FC Fat Player,"I don't think so, South Park"
1068,9,5,FC Pitcher,"Yeah, you think we wanna win? Then we have to keep playing this boring game!"
1069,9,5,FC Team,Yeah!
1070,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,You hate this game too?
1071,9,5,FC Batter,Yeah! And then we won the stupid regionals and had to do this lousy-ass tournament!
1072,9,5,FC Catcher,We wanna play video games.
1073,9,5,Butters Stotch,Oh no!
1074,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!"
1075,9,5,FC Pitcher,I don't think so! There's no way you can lose to us! We're going doowwn! We're gonna get creeaamed!
1076,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No, we're gonna get creamed!"
1077,9,5,FC Batter,We'll just see about that!
1078,9,5,SP Team,Oh yeah?
1079,9,5,FC Team,Yeah!
1080,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there. [standa and claps] Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!"
1081,9,5,Mr Pratt,"[claps] Come on, Fort Collins! Let 'em have it! Yeah!"
1082,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[nudges Sharon] Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. [drinks. On the field, Fort Collins is up at bat]"
1083,9,5,Eric Cartman,"All right, hit one out of the park!"
1084,9,5,FC Announcer,And first up for Fort Collins is... Morgan Pratt.
1085,9,5,Randy Marsh,Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter!
1086,9,5,Mr Pratt,"Knock it out of the park, Morgan! Cream these turds! [Morgan gets ready to swing, Stan sends his pitch and Cartman catches. Morgan does not swing]"
1087,9,5,Umpire,Steerike!
1088,9,5,Randy Marsh,Yeah!
1089,9,5,FC Team,"Yeah, all right!"
1090,9,5,Stan Marsh,Damnit!
1091,9,5,Eric Cartman,"[sends the ball back to Stan] Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it."
1092,9,5,Morgan Pratt,No way! I'm striking out!
1093,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. [Stan thinks, then throws the pitch. It goes wide and Cartman catches it]"
1094,9,5,Umpire,Ball!
1095,9,5,Eric Cartman,All right! [throws it back to Stan]
1096,9,5,FC Pitcher,Morgan!
1097,9,5,Morgan Pratt,[looks over] What?
1098,9,5,FC Pitcher,"You have to swing when it's a ball, otherwise, you're gonna walk to first base. Don't swing, only if it's a strike!"
1099,9,5,Morgan Pratt,[faces the dugout] Well how the Sam Hell am I supposed to know if he's gonna be throwing a strike or a ball?!
1100,9,5,FC Pitcher,You just have to guess.
1101,9,5,Morgan Pratt,"Aw, Jesus! [turns around and goes back to bat. Stan looks to Cartman for cues]"
1102,9,5,Eric Cartman,Ball. Balll. [Stan pitches right down the middle]
1103,9,5,Umpire,Steerike two!
1104,9,5,Stan Marsh,No!
1105,9,5,Eric Cartman,"That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!"
1106,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!"
1107,9,5,Mr Pratt,"Come on Fort Collins! This team can't pitch! [Stan pitches, Morgan hits] There you go, Morgan! Run run run!"
1108,9,5,Morgan Pratt,Aw damnit! [heads to first base]
1109,9,5,FC Pitcher,Why the hell did you swing at it?!
1110,9,5,Morgan Pratt,Well I thought he was gonna throw a ball that time! [Fort Collins is ahead 1-0. Another FC batter comes up...]
1111,9,5,Umpire,Strike three! You're out!
1112,9,5,FC Batter 1,All right!
1113,9,5,Umpire,Ball four!
1114,9,5,Eric Cartman,What?!
1115,9,5,Randy Marsh,Walk to first! Woo!
1116,9,5,Eric Cartman,"[throws his bat down and walks] Aw Goddamnit! [as Cartman walks to first, anotherr SP runner walks home]"
1117,9,5,Umpire,Safe!
1118,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Crud! [the scorekeeper updates the board]
1119,9,5,Randy Marsh,Fort Collins can't play!
1120,9,5,Mr Pratt,Why don't you shut your mouth before I kick your ass!
1121,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[gets up and takes off his shirt] Come on, let's go! I'm right here!"
1122,9,5,Sharon Marsh,Randy...
1123,9,5,Mr Pratt,Sit down before you get hurt! [Randy throws his beer at him] Mother bitch! [the two men begin fighting on the bleachers]
1124,9,5,Stan Marsh,"[sees, turns away and hides his face in his right hand] Goddamnit... [the men have taken the fight to the field and are next to a trashcan. Stan pitches and the FC batter fails to swing]"
1125,9,5,Umpire,Strike three! [The South Park adults stand up and cheer. The next scenes go into time-lapse: more runs are added until the final score is reached: 4 - 3]
1126,9,5,FC Announcer,That's it. South Park wins the game. [the Fort Collins team cheers]
1127,9,5,Stan Marsh,Aw spit! [throws his mitt down on the mound. His father is arrested again with his pants around his ankles and hauled towards a waiting patrol car]
1128,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[slurred] Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!"
1129,9,5,Umpire,Strike three. You're out.
1130,9,5,Greeley Batter (Brian) and Dad,[leaves] Yeah!
1131,9,5,Greeley Team,All right! Yeah! Woohoo!
1132,9,5,Greeley Man,"Goddamnit Brian, swing!"
1133,9,5,Randy Marsh,Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks!
1134,9,5,Umpire,Ball four!
1135,9,5,Butters Stotch,Aw hamburgers. [throws his bat aside]
1136,9,5,SP Team,"God! [Randy takes off his shirt, challenges, and the two men begin to fight]"
1137,9,5,Umpire,Strike three!
1138,9,5,Eric Cartman,"How the hell was that a strike?! [starts kicking dirt on the umpire] Goddamnit, he's going to first!"
1139,9,5,Randy Marsh,"What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!"
1140,9,5,Umpire,¡Strrrrike tres!
1141,9,5,Pueblo Team,Bueno bueno! Bueno! Espectacular!
1142,9,5,Pueblo Dad,¡Vamonos Pueblo! ¡Viva la Pueblo!
1143,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[using a Spanish textbook for assistance] ¡Pueblo, no bueno! ¡Pueblo es muy mal! [a pitch is sent to an SP batter, who doesn't swing]"
1144,9,5,Umpire,"¡Ball cuatro, por favor! [the scoreboard is updated, Randy fights with the Pueblo dad and is hauled off a fourth time]"
1145,9,5,Randy Marsh,This is America! This is an honest America!
1146,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game! [the adults cheer]"
1147,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,We're so proud of you kids!
1148,9,5,Eric Cartman,What happens if we win the State Championship game?
1149,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball!"
1150,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1151,9,5,Mr Donovan,"You could do it, kids! We know you can win State!"
1152,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming."
1153,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh no. No, no, no!"
1154,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Dad? Dad, we need to talk."
1155,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[doesn't move] Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever."
1156,9,5,Stan Marsh,[sighs] Goddamnit. [goes back into the restaurant]
1157,9,5,Randy Marsh,"I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game. [smiles] This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life."
1158,9,5,Announcer,"This is News 4, at noon."
1159,9,5,Anchor Tom,The Colorado Little League State Championship is being played this week. Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the major-league stadium downtown.
1160,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can't tell you how excited they are."
1161,9,5,Stan Marsh,I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
1162,9,5,Denver Player,Win? Why the hell would we want to win?
1163,9,5,Denver Player 2,Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.
1164,9,5,Reporter Chris,"[draws closer to the teams] Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?"
1165,9,5,Stan Marsh,Gay.
1166,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son."
1167,9,5,Randy Marsh,"They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really ""trash-talk,"" but, I don't think Denver has a chance."
1168,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team-"
1169,9,5,Bat dad,"[blue headdress and cape, pops in] Oh yeah! Oh yeah! [leaps closer to the camera] South Park is goin' down! Feel it comin'! [humps back to Randy] You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh!"
1170,9,5,Sheila Broflovski,Who's that?
1171,9,5,A Woman,"That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers. He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight."
1172,9,5,"Tom ""Bat Dad"" Nelson",There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base!
1173,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments?"
1174,9,5,Randy Marsh,Well I think that there's a uh...
1175,9,5,"Tom ""Bat Dad"" Nelson",Mr. Marsh? Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?! Iii am the ultimate Little League trash-talking father! Iii am the Bat Dad!
1176,9,5,Denver Cop,"[one of two come to take him away] All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come on."
1177,9,5,"Tom ""Bat Dad"" Nelson","Bat Dad knows no fear! Bat Dad knows no pain! I want you, Marsh! I want you!!"
1178,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Well, tension is certainly high here, but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field."
1179,9,5,Randy Marsh,[realizing he could end up like that] Oh my God.
1180,9,5,Denver Player 3,Good luck! You're gonna need it.
1181,9,5,Denver Player 4,"Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible. [the Denver team leaves, as do all the adults]"
1182,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game."
1183,9,5,Eric Cartman,"Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team."
1184,9,5,Clyde Donovan,Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
1185,9,5,Eric Cartman,"Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass."
1186,9,5,Stan Marsh,Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
1187,9,5,Craig Tucker,But who?
1188,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,I know who.
1189,9,5,Announcer,"Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, from New York City. [among the people leaving the airport is Kyle's cousin, Kyle]"
1190,9,5,Kyle 1,I'm baaack!
1191,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. [the team goes up to greet him]"
1192,9,5,Kyle 1,"Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas."
1193,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team."
1194,9,5,Kyle 1,"Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses."
1195,9,5,Craig Tucker,He's perfect.
1196,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance."
1197,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[softly] ...I'm not gonna go. [Sharon's eyes opem, and she rises a bit]"
1198,9,5,Sharon Marsh,What?
1199,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go."
1200,9,5,Sharon Marsh,Why?
1201,9,5,Randy Marsh,"I just... don't think I can, all right?"
1202,9,5,Sharon Marsh,You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Why wouldn't you go and support him? What-? [Randy rises and faces her]
1203,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Because I'm scared, all right?! [Sharon stays quiet] You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore. [turns away and bows his head] I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon."
1204,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!"
1205,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am."
1206,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself."
1207,9,5,Randy Marsh,"I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. [walks off]"
1208,9,5,Announcer,Welcome to the Colorado Little League State Championship Game! [the crowd cheers] This must be pretty exciting for these youngsters. A chance to go to the national circuit. [the teams meet at the pitcher's mound]
1209,9,5,Denver Pitcher,You know what these guys look like to me? A bunch of winners!
1210,9,5,Denver Catcher,Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!
1211,9,5,Eric Cartman,I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
1212,9,5,Denver Pitcher,You're the best!
1213,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
1214,9,5,Denver Pitcher,"Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!"
1215,9,5,Bat Dad,"Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!"
1216,9,5,Woman,"Chris, will you sit down?"
1217,9,5,Announcer,"[in the Press Box] First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz. [Kyle 1 comes up to bat]"
1218,9,5,Kyle 1,[stands on home plate] Where do I stand?
1219,9,5,Umpire,"R-right over here. [Kyle 1 looks, then goes to one side of the plate with his back to the pitcher. The umpire positions him properly]"
1220,9,5,Kyle 1,"Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma. [The pitcher throws the ball. Kyle 1 pulls his bat back]"
1221,9,5,Umpire,Strike 1!
1222,9,5,SP Team,Yeah! All right!
1223,9,5,Kyle 1,"Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!"
1224,9,5,Second Baseman,He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!
1225,9,5,Kyle 1,[swings and misses] Oh Jesus!
1226,9,5,Umpire,Strike 2!
1227,9,5,SP Team,Yeah!
1228,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Wow, he IS great at sucking."
1229,9,5,Eric Cartman,[happily] We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
1230,9,5,Kyle 1,"Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket. [The pitcher squints and focuses on the bat, which says ""Barry Bonds"" on it. The pitcher throws the ball and hits the bat, which falls out of Kyle Schwartz's hands]"
1231,9,5,Umpire,It's a bunt!
1232,9,5,Mr Donovan,"Run kid, run!"
1233,9,5,Kyle 1,Oh Jesus! [runs towards first base]
1234,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Aw crap! [Stan drops. Kyle 1 goes towards second and no one is stopping him. He passes it]
1235,9,5,Kyle 1,"[out of breath] I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet!"
1236,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Keep running, kid! [one of the SP players has his face buried in his right hand]"
1237,9,5,Bat Dad,"Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home! [Kyle 1 heads towards home and passes that]"
1238,9,5,Umpire,"Safe! [the crowd cheers and the scoreboard displays him and ""HOMERUN!!!!"" underneath. Smaller screens on the board display fireworks]"
1239,9,5,Kyle 1,"Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody! [nobody high-fives him]"
1240,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
1241,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our team suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. [next pitch: the ball hits the bat again, and the SP runner has to go to first, as it's a bunt. Token goes up. The pitch hits the bat at the top - another bunt]"
1242,9,5,Token Black,No!
1243,9,5,Mr Williams,Yeeaahh! Go Token go!
1244,9,5,Bat Dad,"All right, Denver! You're up to bat now! [Butters is waving his hand for some reason, and the Danver batter squints and focuses on Butters' glove. Stan pitches, the batter hits, and Butters catches the ball. He's dismayed to find it in his glove.]"
1245,9,5,Umpire,Out!
1246,9,5,Denver Team,Yaaay!
1247,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out! [the scoreboard is updated in time-lapse: Denver doesn't have a run on there.] Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long."
1248,9,5,Butters Stotch,"[frustrated, takes his cap off and throws it on the ground] Son of a biscuit!"
1249,9,5,Announcer,"It's the bottom of the last inning here at Coors Field; the score is South Park 23, Denver 0. [a tired Stan pitches right down the middle and the Denver player doesn't move]"
1250,9,5,Umpire,Strike 1!
1251,9,5,Bat Dad,"Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad!"
1252,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
1253,9,5,Bat Dad,"Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver!"
1254,9,5,A Voice,"Denver sucks ass! [Bat Dad looks over. Randy has arrived with a tray of five beers. He's ready to rumble. He sits three rows behind Bat Dad, next to Sharon] Come on, South Park! These kids can't play! In fact, these kids are terrible! [Stan pitches, the batter swings after Cartman catches the ball]"
1255,9,5,Umpire,Strike 2!
1256,9,5,Kyle 1,"Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting."
1257,9,5,Randy Marsh,"It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!"
1258,9,5,Bat Dad,You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you!
1259,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[stands up, takes off his shirt, and challenges] What do you wanna do, huh? [Bat Dad climbs over the seats and he and Randy begin to fight, taking it to the aisle]"
1260,9,5,Stan Marsh,"[sees, turns away and hides his face in his right hand] This can't get any worse. [the two men continue fighting at the bottom of the level and towards the foul pole. Bat Dad picks Randy up and throws him over the railing. Randy bounces off a bench, breaking it in two.]"
1261,9,5,Bat Dad,"[stands on the railing and spreads his cape wide open] Now for the finishing move! You're about to be Bat-Dadded! [jumps off, but misses Randy entirely. They end up in the bullpen.]"
1262,9,5,Commentator,"It all comes down to this! South Park is just one pitch away from being State Champions. [Bat Dad delivers blow after blow and has Randy on the run] Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting. They'd better be careful. The Little League has a no-tolerance policy."
1263,9,5,Umpire,"[comes out of home plate towards the men] Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!"
1264,9,5,Stan Marsh,"[comes off the mound and stands next to Kyle] Disqualified? [looks at Kyle for a few seconds] Fight! Keep fighting! [the fighting continues, and two more umpires enter the picture]"
1265,9,5,Umpire 2,"Break it up! Break it up! [the fighting continues. Bat Dad delivers a blow, shown in slow motion. It connects, and Randy falls backwards to the ground] That's enough! The next person that fights is getting his team disqualified!"
1266,9,5,Bat Dad,"He's done for anyway. [walks off. Randy rises, slowly]"
1267,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Dad! Get up!"
1268,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Get up! You have to fight! [Randy is trying]
1269,9,5,Umpire 2,"All right, come on! Let's play ball!"
1270,9,5,SP Team,Randy! Randy! Randy!
1271,9,5,Mickey,"Get up, Randy! Get up, ya bum!"
1272,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me!"
1273,9,5,Crowd,Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
1274,9,5,Randy Marsh,[now standing] Hey Bat Dad! [Bat Dad turns around] I didn't hear no bell.
1275,9,5,SP Team,"Yeah! [Randy goes on the attack, delivering blow after blow. The umpire and guard return]"
1276,9,5,Umpire 2,"Stop, stop right now! [Randy continues the assault] I'm warning you, sir! [Randy begins singing in falsetto, then knocks Bat Dad to the ground with one final blow.] That's it! That's it! South Park is disqualified!"
1277,9,5,SP Team,Yeah!
1278,9,5,SP Adults,Aww!
1279,9,5,Commentator,"South Park has been disqualified from the game! Denver wins! [The South Park team goes over to Randy, take off their hats, and celebrate their defeat. The Denver players are dismayed at this turn of events and throw down their caps. Two Denver officers come in to get Randy]"
1280,9,5,Kyle 1,We... We lost.
1281,9,5,Randy Marsh,[now arrested and turned around] What? I thought this was a free country! [now being escorted out of the Field]
1282,9,5,Stan Marsh,Dad! [the guards let go and Randy turns around] You're the greatest. [Randy leaps for joy!]
1283,9,6,Stan Marsh,"[impatiently tapping the table] Dude, where is she? We can't wait."
1284,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"God, this is gonna be sooo yummy."
1285,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!"
1286,9,6,Sharon Marsh,Hi boys.
1287,9,6,Stan Marsh,Mom!
1288,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,She's here!
1289,9,6,Eric Cartman,She's got Colonel!
1290,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,I want some!
1291,9,6,Eric Cartman,Oh boy!
1292,9,6,Stan Marsh,[twirling around] I want a breast!
1293,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?"
1294,9,6,Sharon Marsh,"Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken."
1295,9,6,The Boys,Awww!
1296,9,6,Stan Marsh,"But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!"
1297,9,6,Sharon Marsh,It won't take a minute.
1298,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast."
1299,9,6,Stan Marsh,All right.
1300,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[firmly] Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. [Cartman stays behind and quickly sits back down. As the other boys head out of the kitchen, Cartman rips the skins off the chicken pieces and wolfs them down. Sharon and the other boys return with the groceries.]"
1301,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, this is everything, mom. [the boys return to their seats]"
1302,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, let's eat Colonel! [Cartman leaves as the others sit]"
1303,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh, boy! [they see the denuded chicken pieces. Stan looks at Cartman in anger] Cartman, you ate the skin off of EVERY PIECE OF CHICKEN!"
1304,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Well, I saved you all the chicken part. [quiet burp]"
1305,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,The skin's the best part...
1306,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[puts on his jacket] Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. [he leaves the kitchen. The boys are puzzled as to what to do about it. Burying his head in his arms, Kenny sobs]"
1307,9,6,Stan Marsh,I can't believe that fat asshole!
1308,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
1309,9,6,Stan Marsh,Well this time he's gone too far!
1310,9,6,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, fuck him!)"
1311,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?"
1312,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
1313,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!"
1314,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, but he thrives on that."
1315,9,6,Stan Marsh,"All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him."
1316,9,6,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck yeah!)
1317,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,That sounds great!
1318,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[arriving] Hey fags, what's going on? [no one says a word] Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. [silence]"
1319,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
1320,9,6,Stan Marsh,I think I have extra.
1321,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one. [Stan fishes around for some money in his pockets, walks over a bit, and gives it to Kyle] Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?"
1322,9,6,Stan Marsh,Here you go.
1323,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks. [Stan returns to his post next to Kenny]
1324,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle? [neither of them says a thing] Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off? [chuckles. Kenny scratches his right side a bit] Kenny? Kenny?? [the bus pulls up and opens the door. The boys head inside. Stan enters first] Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric! [Kenny enters next] Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents? [Kyle enters last] Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here! [Seeing no reaction, Cartman is stunned. The door closes and the bus pulls away] Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were... [close-up] dead. [dramatic music] No. No, I can't be dead. [runs off] I can't be dead!!"
1325,9,6,Black Plumber,"All right, ma'am. We've got your new toilet installed and we'll haul away the old one away for ya."
1326,9,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you."
1327,9,6,Black Plumber,"Hunh, I could think of a few ways, hunh."
1328,9,6,Liane Cartman,"Ohoho, nhn."
1329,9,6,Eric Cartman,No! No!!
1330,9,6,Fat Plumber,What happened? Did they say?
1331,9,6,Thin Plumber,Apparently there was so much chicken skin in the system it just ruptured the insides.
1332,9,6,Fat Plumber,"Aww, that's tragic."
1333,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, this can't be happening! [he then hears his mother wailing softly, then louder] Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true! [he gets closer to her window. Inside his mother's room, on her bed, the black plumber is pounding Liane from behind, but the bed's noise does not reach Cartman's ears. Cartman turns, wailing.] Oh, it's not fair! [falls to his knees and cries out] Why??? Why??? [cries some more. Liane cries out some more as well]"
1334,9,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman? [Kyle catches a football]"
1335,9,6,Stan Marsh,Cartman isn't our friend anymore. [throws the football back]
1336,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,We're ignoring him.
1337,9,6,Token Black,Ignoring him? How come?
1338,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,Because he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
1339,9,6,Token Black,Oh yeah.
1340,9,6,Craig Tucker,"Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?"
1341,9,6,Blond,Yeah.
1342,9,6,Kevin Stoley,Me too.
1343,9,6,Other boys,"Yeah, screw him! Yeah."
1344,9,6,Clyde Donovan,I never realized ignoring him was an option.
1345,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[arriving] Guys! Guys? [the two teams are seen: On screen left are Jimmy, Token, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. On screen right are Timmy, Craig, Clyde, Kevin, and the blond boy. The teams toss the football at each other] Can anybody hear me? You guys?? [approaches Token] Token, Token, I'm here! [leaves] Hello! Hello! Hello! [approaches Clyde] Clyde, can't you feel me? [moves him around, but no reaction from Clyde] Feel me, Clyde! [moves on to Jimmy] Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric! [blows on Jimmy] Jimmy! [puff] Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me! [turns away] They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead. [begins to tear up] Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul."
1346,9,6,Woman,What is that kid doing?
1347,9,6,Man,"Ah I don't know, just ignore him."
1348,9,6,Butters,"Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-"
1349,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[walking by, lamenting his fate] What did I do to deserve this?! [Butters pays attention] How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!"
1350,9,6,Butters,Hey Eric! [goes back to shoveling snow. Cartman stops in his tracks]
1351,9,6,Eric Cartman,...What did you say?
1352,9,6,Butters,"Huh I just said, ""Hey Eric!"""
1353,9,6,Eric Cartman,Butters... [runs back to Butters] Butters! You can see me??
1354,9,6,Butters,"Well, sure I can see you."
1355,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, and you can hear me??"
1356,9,6,Butters,"[giggles] Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?"
1357,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Because, Butters, I'm... dead. [a few moments of silence]"
1358,9,6,Butters,"[screams and drops his shovel and runs off, hiding behind the family car. Cartman follows him]"
1359,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!"
1360,9,6,Butters,You died?? How??
1361,9,6,Eric Cartman,I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
1362,9,6,Butters,"But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?"
1363,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, but you're the only one who can."
1364,9,6,Butters,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [runs toward the front door, opens it and runs inside, slamming it shut]"
1365,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters! [tries to open the door, then pounds on it furiously] Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!"
1366,9,6,Linda Stotch,"Butters, what on earth are you doing??"
1367,9,6,Butters,Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
1368,9,6,Linda Stotch,Dead people?
1369,9,6,Stephen Stotch,Who's seeing dead people?
1370,9,6,Butters,Me! I saw a ghost!
1371,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts."
1372,9,6,Butters,But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
1373,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you."
1374,9,6,Butters,"Ruh, really?"
1375,9,6,Stephen Stotch,Yeess.
1376,9,6,Butters,So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
1377,9,6,Stephen Stotch,That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.
1378,9,6,Butters,Huh s-s-super-AIDS?
1379,9,6,Stephen Stotch,That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.
1380,9,6,Butters,AAAH! [drops his flashlight] Oh Jesus.
1381,9,6,Stephen Stotch,So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.
1382,9,6,Butters,"Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder. [closes his eyes, but a thunderclap opens his eyes wide] Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. [he looks out the window again. Cartman is seen standing by the bedroom door]"
1383,9,6,Eric Cartman,Butters...
1384,9,6,Butters,[points] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [turns away and ducks under his covers]
1385,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you have to help me!"
1386,9,6,Butters,Go away! You aren't real!
1387,9,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. [pulls out a chain, rattles it, and utters ghostly sounds]"
1388,9,6,Butters,"[panics, screaming] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [Cartman leaves the bedside and hides. Butters' door opens and his parents walk in]"
1389,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, what is going on?!"
1390,9,6,Butters,Well I saw... [points to... nothing] Well he was... [sees there's nothing to prove] Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
1391,9,6,Stephen Stotch,Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!
1392,9,6,Butters,"Y yes, yes sir. [they leave, but Stephen takes one last quick look around, then closes the door. Butters mumbles a few things, then tries to sleep]"
1393,9,6,Eric Cartman,[suddenly on the bed] Butters.
1394,9,6,Butters,AH- [quickly muffles his mouth so his parents don't hear]
1395,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!"
1396,9,6,Butters,But I don't want to see you!
1397,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven."
1398,9,6,Butters,Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
1399,9,6,Eric Cartman,What do you mean?
1400,9,6,Butters,Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
1401,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!"
1402,9,6,Butters,Oh.
1403,9,6,Eric Cartman,Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
1404,9,6,Butters,"I can't. Ahah, I have school tomorrow."
1405,9,6,Eric Cartman,"This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! [brings out the chain, rattles it, and makes ghostly noises with his voice]"
1406,9,6,Butters,"Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!"
1407,9,6,Butters,Mrs. Cartman?
1408,9,6,Liane Cartman,Yes? [turns around] Oh hi.
1409,9,6,Butters,"This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something."
1410,9,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh, what is it?"
1411,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I love her."
1412,9,6,Butters,"He says, he love you. [Cartman sobs]"
1413,9,6,Liane Cartman,"[moved] Oh, that's so nice."
1414,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!"
1415,9,6,Butters,He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
1416,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[emotional] It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!"
1417,9,6,Butters,"He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted."
1418,9,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! [sobs. Cartman sobs too, and then Butters sobs in sympathy]"
1419,9,6,Butters,"Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew. [Cartman sobs. Kyle looks, then gets annoyed] He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times."
1420,9,6,Eric Cartman,Just the good times.
1421,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
1422,9,6,Eric Cartman,I can't! Don't you understand?!
1423,9,6,Butters,He can't! Don't you understand?!
1424,9,6,Eric Cartman,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!"
1425,9,6,Butters,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!"
1426,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[whips out a notepad] All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. [turns around and walk off]"
1427,9,6,Butters,"Uhh alright then. [Butters turns to follow, and Kyle is left looking puzzled]"
1428,9,6,Stan Marsh,Who was that?
1429,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
1430,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he did that to me this morning."
1431,9,6,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
1432,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle."
1433,9,6,Kenny McCormick,(That guy would try anything)
1434,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we know better than to think that."
1435,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's everyone, I guess. [turns around] All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you."
1436,9,6,Butters,"[shuffles his right foot out of modesty] Aww, that's okay, Eric."
1437,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[puts away the notepad in his inside jacket pocket.] Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now."
1438,9,6,Butters,So I won't see you again?
1439,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash."
1440,9,6,Butters,Wow.
1441,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[backs up and waves his hands in front of him as if in a haze] G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! [Cartman steps back a bit more, then stops, then is annoyed]"
1442,9,6,Butters,Yeh you're still here.
1443,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?"
1444,9,6,Butters,"Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough."
1445,9,6,Eric Cartman,What else do I have to do?!
1446,9,6,Butters,"Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did."
1447,9,6,Eric Cartman,Atone?
1448,9,6,Butters,Did you ever do anything really bad?
1449,9,6,Eric Cartman,[thinks] Not really...
1450,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it."
1451,9,6,Butters,[writing] Broke fence...
1452,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid."
1453,9,6,Butters,"Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for."
1454,9,6,Eric Cartman,Really?
1455,9,6,Butters,"Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this."
1456,9,6,Eric Cartman,I know how.
1457,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna make, make it right.
I'm gonna take a little time and set things right.
Make, make it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
It feels so good to be making up
For all the things I've done wrong.
I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven
Wanted from me all along.
All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.
'Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate.
Not faking it, I'm making it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
Make, make it right!
Make, make it right!
Gonna make it right, girl, I've got to have your lovin' tonight!"
1458,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, there's everything, Butters. [stands up and walks off a bit] I've made everything right."
1459,9,6,Butters,Does this mean... you have to go now?
1460,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave. [waves his hands around again as if in a haze] Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye... [his back hits the wall under the window, and he looks at his hands] Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!"
1461,9,6,Butters,Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
1462,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?! [grabs Butters' bat and begins destroying his room with it. First to go is the lamp on top of the foot locker, then something else, then a picture of Butters sitting on a tree stump, then the television, then the television stand, ] Do you think this is funny,..?"
1463,9,6,Butters,"Eric! Calm down. [Cartman destroys the bookshelves, then the toy area] Stupid butthole God! [chucks the bat at Butters, who leans out of the way. The bat smashes his mirror apart. Cartman leaves. Butters surveys the damage, then his parents show up]"
1464,9,6,Stephen Stotch,Butters! What have you done?!
1465,9,6,Butters,I-I-it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
1466,9,6,Linda Stotch,"Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor."
1467,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him."
1468,9,6,Linda Stotch,"What do you think, Doctor?"
1469,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests.
1470,9,6,Linda Stotch,Oh no. [buries her face in Stephen's shoulder] NO!
1471,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,"[in a booth with Butters' parents] All right, Butters, just try to relax. [two robot arms grab Butters along the sides of his torso and head, pick him up, and flip him over] Doin' just fine, Butters. [the arms reposition themselves and raise Butters a little higher. A big red anal probe closes in and begins to vibrate] Just stay perfectly still now, Butters."
1472,9,6,Butters,"[nervous, tries to look back] Lu lu lu, lu lu lu [the anal probe enters and shakes him violently]"
1473,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,"Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters. [the probe takes one last, deep jab. Then, to Stephen.] Don't worry, Mr. Stotch. Whatever traumatized your son in his past, we'll find it. [the robot arms now rock Butters back and forth as the probe does its stuff.]"
1474,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,"Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear."
1475,9,6,Butters,So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
1476,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"Now do you believe us, Butters?"
1477,9,6,Butters,Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.
1478,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,"Good. We're making a lot of headway. We'll do some more testing tomorrow. All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest. [they leave]"
1479,9,6,Linda Stotch,"[stays behind long enough to kiss Butters on the forehead] Goodnight, baby. [leaves. The lights go out]"
1480,9,6,Butters,[relaxing and sleeps...] Ahhh. [...but Cartman appears at the foot of the bed]
1481,9,6,Eric Cartman,Butters.
1482,9,6,Butters,AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
1483,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here."
1484,9,6,Butters,"Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore."
1485,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look! [shows Butters an ad for a psychic] Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!"
1486,9,6,Butters,"Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event."
1487,9,6,Eric Cartman,She's gonna close soon! Come on! [pulls Butters out of bed and away]
1488,9,6,Butters,Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
1489,9,6,Butters,"[still with heavy eyelids] Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?"
1490,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic",Certainly. Come in. [Butters and Cartman follow her in] Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.
1491,9,6,Butters,"Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane."
1492,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic","Well, many times, the reason that the soul stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event."
1493,9,6,Butters,"Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!"
1494,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic","But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time."
1495,9,6,Butters,Really?
1496,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic",Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?
1497,9,6,Butters,"Well, he's sittin' next to me right now."
1498,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic",AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [runs out of the room screaming. The TV turns on mysteriously behind the boys]
1499,9,6,Butters,"Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost."
1500,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I told you, Butters. [a breaking news item comes on]"
1501,9,6,Announcer,This is breaking news!
1502,9,6,Anchor Tom and,A tragic event is unfolding in South Park. Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the Red Cross!
1503,9,6,Reporter Chris,"Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash."
1504,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!"
1505,9,6,Officer,"Stay back, people!"
1506,9,6,Man,"Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!"
1507,9,6,Det Yates,Stay calm in there. We don't want anybody getting hurt.
1508,9,6,Lead Convict,"You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man!"
1509,9,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages."
1510,9,6,Butters,"Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me."
1511,9,6,Eric Cartman,Don't worry. I have a plan. [movers towards an entrance]
1512,9,6,Butters,"Eric. [Cartman turns around] Well, be careful, ghost pal."
1513,9,6,Eric Cartman,"They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. [Cartman moves towards the front door. The detective notices]"
1514,9,6,Det Yates,What the hell is that kid doing?
1515,9,6,Bald Convict,Somebody's comin' in!
1516,9,6,Convict 2,"It's just some little fat kid. [the door opens and Cartman walks in. He starts making haunting, ghostly noises and rattling desks]"
1517,9,6,Bald Convict,What the hell is going on?
1518,9,6,Convict 2,I have no idea.
1519,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, it's working! [hops on a chair, picks up a book, waves it around, and flips the pages in the lead convict's face]"
1520,9,6,Lead Convict,"This is really weird. [Cartman walks over to a file cabinet, opens a drawer, and tosses out all sorts of papers. Butters enters the building, walking quietly as Cartman keeps the three convicts distracted]"
1521,9,6,Reporter Chris,"An incredible development here, Tom. Two little boys have fearlessly gone inside the Red Cross. [footage of Cartman entering the building is shown]"
1522,9,6,Stan Marsh,Cartman?
1523,9,6,Bald Convict,"[scratches his head] I'm so confused! [Butters goes over to the office, removes the chair blocking the door, and opens the door.]"
1524,9,6,Butters,"Hurry. Go, go! [the hostages leave quickly, quietly. They exit the Red Cross.]"
1525,9,6,Officer 2,The hostages are clear!
1526,9,6,Det Yates,"[through the bull horn] All right, move in! [the officers move in. Cartman is dancing around shaking the bells and making ghostly noises]"
1527,9,6,Convict 2,The hostages are gone!
1528,9,6,Bald Convict,What?! [the officers pour in and arrest the convicts] Son of a bitch.
1529,9,6,Reporter Chris,"Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes."
1530,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day."
1531,9,6,Butters,"Boy, we sure did."
1532,9,6,Eric Cartman,"My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends."
1533,9,6,Butters,Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
1534,9,6,Eric Cartman,"We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you."
1535,9,6,Butters,"I'll miss you too, ghost pal."
1536,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[backs up again, waving his hands before him] Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him from his right side, Clyde, Token and Jimmy approach him from his left]"
1537,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did."
1538,9,6,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. [both Cartman and Butters are stunned that everyone can suddenly see Cartman]"
1539,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have."
1540,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow."
1541,9,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. S-see ya, Eric. [Butters looks down]"
1542,9,6,Eric Cartman,[pissed off] You sonofabitch Butters!
1543,9,6,Butters,Huh?
1544,9,6,Eric Cartman,You told me I was a ghost!
1545,9,6,Butters,Huh but I thought you were one!
1546,9,6,Eric Cartman,"How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to [points his finger at Butters] GET YOU BACK! [runs off. Butters just looks at him, baffled. His parents arrive with the doctor]"
1547,9,6,Stephen Stotch,[angered] Butters?!
1548,9,6,Butters,Oh hamburgers.
1549,9,7,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss those questions in class, m'kay? I got a lot o' responses, so let's read some aloud. [pulls out the first letter and reads] ""Mr. Mackey is gay."" [some of the kids laugh] Okay kids, that is not funny! M'kay?! This box is supposed to be used for serious questions! About, about serious issues! M'kay, let's, let's stop the tomfoolery. [puts it aside and reaches into the box for the next letter] M'kay, this looks like a real one here. [reads] ""Dear Mr. Mackey, you are gay."" [the class laughs] All right, all right. That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down and try to be mature, 'kay? [reaches in to read the next one] Uh here we go. Okay, ""Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me, and you are gay."" [the class laughs harder] Dammit, is there not one serious question in here?! [reads the next two letters] ""Mr. Mackey is gay."" ""Mr. Mackey is gay."" [gets the next letter] Okay, here. [reads] ""I am a boy at South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes hard for no reason. What should I do?"" [Jimmy looks around nervously. Cartman cracks up, and the rest of the class, except Jimmy, follows] All right kids, all right kids, that's enough! [a small bell is heard and Jimmy looks down] If you all can't be serious about the question box, [turns and writes ""drugs"" on the board] then we'll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?!"
1550,9,7,Class,Awwwww!
1551,9,7,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics?"
1552,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Uh no, that-that's okay, Mr. Mackey."
1553,9,7,Mr Mackey,"Jimmy, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!"
1554,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey."
1555,9,7,Mr Mackey,Well why the hell not?!
1556,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Uh... [waves him over. Mr. Mackey walks over and bends down to listen to Jimmy whisper in his ear]
1557,9,7,Mr Mackey,"It's what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M'kay, m'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy. [returns to the board] N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don't you come up here?"
1558,9,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, that's bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn't have to do it?!"
1559,9,7,Mr Mackey,"Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now. [Jimmy shows some alarm]"
1560,9,7,Stan Marsh,He's what?? [Kyle shrugs]
1561,9,7,Stan Marsh,"A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall? [the kids begin moving out of the way, leaving Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] Maybe we should do the talent show."
1562,9,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy."
1563,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Hey fellas.
1564,9,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show."
1565,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long.
1566,9,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?"
1567,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone. [his penis gets aroused] Aaah!"
1568,9,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Huh wuh, what's the matter?"
1569,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas. [rushes away and down the hall] Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please. [heads for the boys' room enters, looking for an empty stall. He tries the first toilet stall]"
1570,9,7,Craig Tucker,It's occupied. [Jimmy tries the second stall]
1571,9,7,Eric Cartman,"No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. [Jimmy heads back to the sinks and throws water on his face, then throws water on his pants' crotch]"
1572,9,7,Butters Stotch,"[enters and heads for the urinal] Hehey Jimmy! [arrives at the urinal, drops his trousers and lifts his shirt, and starts pissing] M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always."
1573,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?"
1574,9,7,Butters Stotch,"[notices some heavy drops in the stalls] Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!"
1575,9,7,Eric Cartman,"Up yours, Butters."
1576,9,7,Sarah Valmer,"Hey Jimmy, how was school?"
1577,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Fine, Mom."
1578,9,7,Ryan Valmer,"Jimmy, we understand you're getting erections in the classroom."
1579,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[stops in his tracks for a few seconds, then looks over his shoulder] What? Uh who told you that?"
1580,9,7,Ryan Valmer,"Mr. Mackey, your counselor."
1581,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!
1582,9,7,Ryan Valmer,"Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of. But we know it's something you might have a hard time talking about. Get it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's advice 'nd called Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this."
1583,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Dz-n-Doctor Pal?
1584,9,7,Doctor Pal,"[springs up from behind the sofa and quite eager to start. He talks quickly] Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. Are we cool?"
1585,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Uh, sure?"
1586,9,7,Doctor Pal,"A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I'm I'm down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections. [affects a joking manner] ""Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird"" huh?"
1587,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, a little, yes."
1588,9,7,Doctor Pal,"Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It's just part of growing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it. [laughs at his own cleverness]"
1589,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.
1590,9,7,Doctor Pal,"Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skedaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo."
1591,9,7,Ryan Valmer,"A-all right, come on, honey. [they rise and leave the living room]"
1592,9,7,Doctor Pal,"Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss."
1593,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Ke...c-come again?
1594,9,7,Doctor Pal,"Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do. [leans forward a little] Unless, of course, you think we should take off our shirts and kiss."
1595,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss"
1596,9,7,Doctor Pal,"Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own. [walks out the door and closes it behind him]"
1597,9,7,Announcer,"Next up for the talent show, put your hands together for the incredibly talented Jimmy Valmer! [he approaches the mic. On one side is a stool with a glass of water on it. The school audience is cheering]"
1598,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, ""Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet."" [the audience laughs heartily] So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this? [his penis is around and his erection begins to show] A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic. [the claps are few, his erection is bigger] Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court. [the kids begin to notice the erection and whisper to each other. Jimmy's beginning to falter] You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems. [a girl screams and runs out of the gym. The other kids follow. Jimmy's penis has gotten so big it blocks his view of the audience. He moves it to his left so he can see everyone on his right] Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience. [swings it to his right to see everyone on his left] What a fantastic audience."
1599,9,7,Mrs Garrison,"Don't worry, Jimmy. We're not laughing with you, we're laughing AT you. [several shots of the audience laughing at Jimmy. Jimmy wakes up and sits up on his bed.]"
1600,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh! [punches his genitals with both his fists, then falls asleep hard]"
1601,9,7,Butters Stotch,"Lu Lu Lu, I've got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you've got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let's get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu."
1602,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Butters!
1603,9,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy. [turns off the tape player] I'm just practicin' for the talent show."
1604,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me."
1605,9,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem."
1606,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?"
1607,9,7,Butters Stotch,[thinks a moment] Well sure I do.
1608,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Really??
1609,9,7,Butters Stotch,"Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk. [they sit next to the boom box] You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina."" [fans his fingers out] Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady."
1610,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?"
1611,9,7,Butters Stotch,"That's right, Jimmy."
1612,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.
1613,9,7,Girl,"Talk to you, Bertha."
1614,9,7,Bertha,"Okay, see you later, Jessie."
1615,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Hey Bertha.
1616,9,7,Bertha,"Oh, hey Jimmy. What's goin' on?"
1617,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?"
1618,9,7,Bertha,"What?? No way! [Cartman walks into view, overhears, then stops to listen]"
1619,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,But the talent show is tomorrow! [Bertha slaps him] Ooo!
1620,9,7,Bertha,"Jerk! [walks away, Cartman comes forward]"
1621,9,7,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?"
1622,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
1623,9,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food."
1624,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?"
1625,9,7,Eric Cartman,"Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times."
1626,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, wha-what do I do?"
1627,9,7,Eric Cartman,I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
1628,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch."
1629,9,7,Eric Cartman,"Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say."
1630,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow! Thanks, Eric."
1631,9,7,Shawna's Mom,"Shawna honey, I think your little date is here."
1632,9,7,Shawna,"[heads for the door] Okay, Mom. [opens it, and finds Jimmy waiting outside]"
1633,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Hey Shawna.
1634,9,7,Shawna,Hi Jimmy.
1635,9,7,Eric Cartman,"[hiding in some bushes nearby] Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks."
1636,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, Shawna, you look f-fantastic."
1637,9,7,Shawna,"Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?"
1638,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini"
1639,9,7,Waiter,Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentico experience Italiano. My name is Roma. Can I start you out with some lotsa pasta macaroni minis?
1640,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers."
1641,9,7,Waiter,Right away. [walks away]
1642,9,7,Shawna,You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her.
1643,9,7,Eric Cartman,"[at a nearby booth] Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."""
1644,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
1645,9,7,Shawna,"Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, ""No WAY do I want it now!"" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so-"
1646,9,7,Eric Cartman,"[Roma sets some plates of food on his table] All right, when she stops yappin' again, say ""Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."""
1647,9,7,Shawna,"I guess that's why I figured, ""Who needs friends like THAT?"""
1648,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right."
1649,9,7,Shawna,"It's like I told Debbie: ""If you're gonna go out with my friends-"""
1650,9,7,Eric Cartman,"All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful."""
1651,9,7,Shawna,"""And so if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."""
1652,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"""If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."" Wow, how insightful."
1653,9,7,Shawna,"You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener."
1654,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Really?
1655,9,7,Shawna,"Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do."
1656,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina."
1657,9,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice."
1658,9,7,Shawna,[stunned] ...What??? [crosses her arms and glares] I'm not doing that!
1659,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,But the talent show is tomorrow night!
1660,9,7,Shawna,"Creep! [throws her glass of water at him and walks out. The water shorts out his headphones, and Cartman takes his off from the feedback]"
1661,9,7,Eric Cartman,Aaagh!
1662,9,7,Mrs Garrison,"Welcome students and parents to the annual South Park Elementary Talent Show! [some applause] We have a lot of little talneted performers to get through, so the quicker you shut up, the quicker this will be over! [everyone quiets down] Okay, first up we have Billy Turner, from the third grade, who will be doing an alto sax solo. [out comes Billy with his alto sax and he begins to play Frиre Jacques. His notes are tentative and wobbly]"
1663,9,7,Officer Barbrady,Jimmy? Jimmy Valmer?
1664,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[looks up] Oh... Hi, Officer B b-b-buh b-b-buh b-Barbrady."
1665,9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Jimmy, what are you doing here? The talent show is inside."
1666,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show. [sobs again]
1667,9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Not perform? [sits down next to him] But Jimmy, you love talent shows. Everyone in town knows that."
1668,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,I just c-can't risk getting up in front of everyone.
1669,9,7,Officer Barbrady,Why?
1670,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them.
1671,9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don't wanna have sex."
1672,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke.
1673,9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They're not like the ladies down at Colfax Point."
1674,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,...Colfax Point?
1675,9,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody."
1676,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady! [heads off to the nearest bus station]"
1677,9,7,Officer Barbrady,"You're welcome, Jim. [happy at first, he begins to think over that last conversation] Wait..."
1678,9,7,Voice over,Colfax Point. Pimps and hos and tricks in rows. Women walk the street with corns on their feets. Broken dreams and no ice creams.
1679,9,7,Ho,You lookin' for a date?
1680,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[entering this hellhole] Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis in a woman's vagina. Any takers? [before him, a ho dressed as a Red Cross nurse is left behind by a customer] Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?"
1681,9,7,Prostitute,They call me Nut Gobbler.
1682,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid."
1683,9,7,Nut Gobbler,Huh??
1684,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started."
1685,9,7,Nut Gobbler,You a cop?
1686,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic."
1687,9,7,Nut Gobbler,You got money?
1688,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Sure do.
1689,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"All right, you got a place to go?"
1690,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Sure. I know the p-perfect place.
1691,9,7,Roma,"Welcome to Buca de Fagghecini for the authentic experienso Italiano. My name is Roma, and uhhh [recognizes Jimmy] Oh, it's so nice to see you again, Mr. Valmer."
1692,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[grabs Roma by the collar and talks to him in hushes tones] Hey, can it, jackass! I just don't want them to know I was here with a different girl."
1693,9,7,Roma,"Oh right, pardone, segnore. I'll come back with some garlic bread mediterraneane. [walks off]"
1694,9,7,Nut Gobbler,What are we doin' anyway?
1695,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,This is authentic Italian food straight from S-Sicily. You should try the Lotsa Mozzarella Pizza Roll.
1696,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"I can't eat too much, I've got an infected urinary tract. I've been pissin' blood for a week."
1697,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."
1698,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Huh? [takes out a lighter and cigarette and lights the cigarette] Well, that's it, I just piss blood! So I have to stick a tampon up my peehole."
1699,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more."
1700,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Look, kid, what are you doin'?! You wanna get laid or not?"
1701,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Well of couse I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say..
1702,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Kid, I'm a hooker. You don't have to take me to dinner OR be nice to me."
1703,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,What? Fo-for real?
1704,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"You paid me, so you get to do me. It's that simple."
1705,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'! [A black man angrily approaches the table]"
1706,9,7,Pimp,"What are you doin', ho?! Havin' dinner?! You're supposed to be workin' for me!"
1707,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"It's where the trick wanted to go, you bastard!"
1708,9,7,Pimp,"Trick?! I ain't stupid! Ain't no trick gonna take you out to dinner! [Roma arrives with some food, but quickly leaves when he sees what's happening] This PIMP is tryin' to steal you away from me! [to Jimmy] This is MY ho!"
1709,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"I beg to differ with you, sir. I paid for her and took her out to dinner. She's my ho!"
1710,9,7,Nut Gobbler,Uh Jesus.
1711,9,7,Pimp,"You got a problem, bitch?!"
1712,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Yes, I do have a problem, as a matter of fact! I've spent all my money on this ho, and she's now my only shot at getting laid, and the talent show is only a couple of hours from being over."
1713,9,7,Pimp,[to Nut Gobbler] You're comin' home right now! [grabs her by the hair hard]
1714,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Agh! Let go of my hair, you son of a bitch!"
1715,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Sir, sir, that is my ho!"
1716,9,7,Pimp,"I'm gonna kick your ass, ho! [hauls her off]"
1717,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[watching the pimp pull Nut Gobbler away] Sir, sir!"
1718,9,7,Stan Marsh,"[bored, exchanges looks with Kyle] Woof."
1719,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Son of a ...b-bitch! [a taxicab rolls by, and Jimmy hails it] Taxi! [the cab stops, and Jimmy gets in] Follow that pimp and ho! [the driver does as told and peels away]"
1720,9,7,Nut Gobbler,Where are you taking me?!
1721,9,7,Pimp,"I'm gonna kill you, ho!"
1722,9,7,Nut Gobbler,No! Please! Q Money! I'm sorry!
1723,9,7,Q Money,"You're already dead, ho! [outside the driver window, the cab has pulled up alongside. Jimmy rolls down his window]"
1724,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief!"
1725,9,7,Q Money,"Fuck you, punk! [turns his steering wheel left so his car rams the cab. The cab spins away, but recovers and comes up along the passenger side this time.]"
1726,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch! [sticks it out for her to grab. She fails at grabbing it a few times, but finally succeeds. She begins to climb out of Q Money's car and has one leg out of the car]"
1727,9,7,Q Money,"[grabs onto Nut Gobbler's other leg] Get your ass back in here, ho!"
1728,9,7,Nut Gobbler,Aaaah! [she's basically doing the splits between the cars]
1729,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"I got you, Nut Gobbler! [the two cars race down the streets with Nut Gobbler spread out between them like a Thanksgiving turkey]"
1730,9,7,Tall Goth,"No no nono no, I'm not gonna be in the talent show. Oh no nono no. I'll never be in your faggy talent show. [the song ends and they walk offstage. Some applause for them comes up from the audience]"
1731,9,7,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, that was the Goth kids with ""Talent Shows Are For Fags"""
1732,9,7,Tall Goth,That was killer. We showed them.
1733,9,7,Red Goth,"Yeah, I hope we win."
1734,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Come on, ho! [the cars bump each other and pull apart, each male, Jimmy and Q Money, wanting Nut Gobbler with him. A motorcycle driver is coming towards them]"
1735,9,7,Cabbie,Look out!
1736,9,7,Motorcyclist,Daww?
1737,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Aah?? [the motorcyclist smacks into Nut Gobbler's groin and gets stuck there as his motorcycle continues without him and falls away] NO! [the motorcyclist is screaming, but his screams are muffled. Q Money takes out his gun and takes a few shots at Jimmy. One shot gets him in the right shoulder and he has to let go of Nut Gobbler. Both she and the motorcyclist fall into Q Money's car] '"
1738,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up! [the chase continues]
1739,9,7,Kid Magician,Tada! [some applause comes up from the audience.]
1740,9,7,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Clark and Laura. Very nice. [they carry off the box Laura was in] Our next act is Butters, who will be singing a song"
1741,9,7,Stephen,[takes a picture] There's our boy. [Linda claps with the audience. The piano begins]
1742,9,7,Butters Stotch,"Lu lu lu, I've got some... [pauses as he forgets the words] Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no! [a puddle of urine forms under him] No no noho noo! [runs off the stage]"
1743,9,7,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, thank you Butters, very nice, short and sweet. [whips out a towel and wipes the stage clean of urine]"
1744,9,7,Q Money,"Goddamn, this pimp just won't give up!"
1745,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[to the cabbie] Get close to him! [the cabbie does so, and Jimmy jumps onto the roof of Q Money's car. Q Money does what he can to shake Jimmy off, but Jimmy stays on. When Q Money draws close to the cab, Jimmy looks at the cabbie] How much do I owe you?"
1746,9,7,Cabbie,[checks the meter] Six dollars and twenty-four cents.
1747,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[reaches into his pockets and pulls out a ten dollar bill] C-can I just get two back, please?"
1748,9,7,Cabbie,"Oh, thank you very much. [smiles and gives Jimmy the two dollars] There you go. Have a good 'n."
1749,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Thank you. [the cabbie leaves the scene, his job complete. Q Money continues flying down the street and into Colfax Point. The other prostitutes watch in shock. Q Money slams the car into a light pole and Jimmy is catapulted through the air and lands in a trash heap. Q Money takes Nut Gobbler out of the car and pulls her away by the hair again]"
1750,9,7,Q Money,"You're gonna pay for this, bitch!"
1751,9,7,Nut Gobbler,No! Heelllp!! [The motorcyclist looks up dazed from the back seat of the crashed car. Jimmy makes his way out of the trash heap. Q Money drags Nut Gobbler up the stairs of a nearby building] Haaaaaaaaaa!!
1752,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[in hot pursuit now] Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming! [his penis gets hard again and he freezes] Oh Jesus, not now. [he gathers his legs tight so the erection doesn't show as much] Oh boy, this is embarrassing. [he walks off gingerly]"
1753,9,7,Mrs Garrison,"And now we have Eric Cartman, who will be doing select readings from the movie, Scarface. [leaves as the curtains open]"
1754,9,7,Eric Cartman,"[starts off with his back to the audience, then turns around] D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!"
1755,9,7,Liane Cartman,That's my little boy. [smiles. Gerald and Sheila are stunned]
1756,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Please, Q Money! Don't do this!"
1757,9,7,Q Money,"I told you never to turn on me, ho!"
1758,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"[catches up with the pair] Hey, j-j-jackass! [he and Q Money face each other] I'm sorry I resorted to calling you jackass just now, but I'm very upset!"
1759,9,7,Q Money,"And what are you gonna do, huh?! I've got four feet on you AND a gun! What do you have?!"
1760,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
1761,9,7,Q Money,What?!
1762,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years.
1763,9,7,Q Money,[laughs] That's pretty good.
1764,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
1765,9,7,Q Money,"[laughs] Oh yeah. That's right, she is. [behind him, Nut Gobbler grabs a pipe and approaches him silently]"
1766,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them. [Q Money laughs heartily as Nut Gobbler reaches him. She knocks him out with one blow to the back of the head.]
1767,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"Serves you right, you son of a bitch!"
1768,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler."
1769,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"I can't believe you chased me all this way. You, you really care about me."
1770,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute."
1771,9,7,Nut Gobbler,"That's good enough for me. [takes off her coat and poses enticingly] Take me to bed. [Jimmy approaches her, reaches out, and she falls back and lands with a thud on his arms and crutches. He then hoists her up and carries her down the stairs to the bottom floor of the building. He carries her out the door, through the group of hookers gathered to marvel at the sight, and towards a Ho-Tel. One admiring prostitute wipes away a tear. Jimmy carries Nut Gobbler through the door and onto a bed nearby. The door closes and the light goes out. All the other hookers keep applauding]"
1772,9,7,Ike,"I have a Yankee Doodle sweetheart,She's my Yankee Doodle girl.[holds up some sparklers]'Ankee Doodle came to London,Just to ride the ponies,[throws them off and gets inside a small cannon next to him. The barrel rises until it's in launch position]I am da Yankee DoodleI am da Yankee DoodleI am da Yankee Doodle boy.[The cannon shoots him out and he lands clear across the stage. Some applause greets the performance. As the props are taken away, Ike takes off his hat and bows low to everyone, then puts on his top hat and walks off]"
1773,9,7,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Ike, thank you. All right, children, it looks like we have no more contestants, which means, the Talent Show is over! [the children cheer and Principal Victoria nudges a sleeping Mr. Mackey]"
1774,9,7,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Mackey, it's over."
1775,9,7,Mr Mackey,"Huh? [takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes] Oh oh oh, right."
1776,9,7,Mrs Garrison,Now we will tally up the judges' scores and find out which act they hated the least.
1777,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Hold everything! [Mrs. Garrison looks up. Jimmy has entered the gym and walks towards the stage. The audience watches him head up the steps] Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone.."
1778,9,7,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, let's put our hands together for Jimmy Valmer. [some applause heads his way]"
1779,9,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas. [everyone laughs] I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to- [his penis gets hard again and he's surprised] You've gotta be kidding me."
1780,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat."
1781,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around."
1782,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Man, I wish I could really drive this thing."
1783,9,8,Eric Cartman,You know how?
1784,9,8,Stan Marsh,Sure I do!
1785,9,8,Eric Cartman,Well here. [reaches down to grab something] Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
1786,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it."
1787,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility."
1788,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[reaches over and grabs the keys.] Okay, turn on the ignition,"
1789,9,8,Eric Cartman,[puts on sunglasses as the engine purrs to life] Awesome.
1790,9,8,Stan Marsh,Okay... [pulls on a handle]
1791,9,8,Eric Cartman,We're not moving.
1792,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[pulls harder. The motor creates a froth of water behind the boat, which is still in place]"
1793,9,8,Eric Cartman,Maybe you have the parking brake on.
1794,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! [presses that and the boat lunges out of its landing, spinning around a few times as it jumps another dock nearby. The boat goes forward in a haphazard manner. Both boys scream]"
1795,9,8,Eric Cartman,Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
1796,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[pushes the handle forward again, but it breaks in his hand. He can no longer control the boat, so he and Cartman scream again, then] Jesus Christ!!!"
1797,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Stan... beaver dam! [the boat approaches the dam quuickly] Very large beaver dam, Stan!! [the boat runs aground on the dam and the boys quickly jump out. The boat begins to smoke as the boys swim to the nearest shore. Stan, being lighter and faster, reaches shore first, then turns to wait for Cartman. The boat blows up and Stan shields his eyes. Cartman reaches the shore and walks up to Stan]"
1798,9,8,Stan Marsh,Oh dude! Oh Jesus!
1799,9,8,Eric Cartman,[turns around and sees] Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
1800,9,8,Stan Marsh,You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
1801,9,8,Eric Cartman,I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
1802,9,8,Stan Marsh,What?
1803,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! [hustles up the beach]"
1804,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers."
1805,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns to look at Stan] Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! [Cartman turns back and continues up the beach. Stan turns and follows Cartman up]"
1806,9,8,Announcer,"With an eye on America and all of today's events, it's South Park Evening News, with Tom Pusslicker"
1807,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam. [the Marshes are shown eating off small folding tables with dinners on them and looking at the TV] Earlier today, a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open, trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives. [a helicopter camera catches the flooding]"
1808,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my gosh, those poor people."
1809,9,8,Field Reporter Mitch,"Tom, I'm currently ten miles outside of Beaverton, unable to get inside the town proper. We do not have any reports of fatalities yet, but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions. Beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand, Tom, so this would be quite devastating."
1810,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch? [Stan has stopped eating. Sharon and Shelly continue.]"
1811,9,8,Field Reporter Mitch,"W-we're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of Beaverton, uh Tom, but we're reporting that there's looting, raping, and yes, even acts of cannibalism."
1812,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other?"
1813,9,8,Field Reporter Mitch,"No, no, we haven't actually seen it Tom, we're just reporting it."
1814,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"[rises and begins to pick up the spent trays] You all done with your fishsticks, Stan?"
1815,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[rises and takes his own tray up] I'll help you, Sharon. [looks at the screen] Boy, that's just awful."
1816,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated."
1817,9,8,Man 1,That's right! We know whose fault this is!
1818,9,8,Stan Marsh,Huh oh. [puts his hands to his cheeks. Shelly gives him a funny look]
1819,9,8,Man 1,It's George Bush's fault!
1820,9,8,Man 2,Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!
1821,9,8,Man 3,George Bush didn't break that beaver dam! It was terrorists and Al Qaeda!
1822,9,8,Man 4,They've been secretly building beaver dam WMDs for years now! [a few other voices rise up to mention WMDs]
1823,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad? [hesitating] Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?"
1824,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago."
1825,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault."
1826,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?"
1827,9,8,Randy Marsh,"That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. [nothing more is exchanged between Stan and his parents]"
1828,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?"
1829,9,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
1830,9,8,Stan Marsh,You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
1831,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Shyeah, that was pretty funny."
1832,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!"
1833,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!"
1834,9,8,Stan Marsh,But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
1835,9,8,Eric Cartman,Well they should've gotten out of there!
1836,9,8,Stan Marsh,Maybe they couldn't get out!
1837,9,8,Eric Cartman,We did!
1838,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, ah I just... [walks around in a fog of worry] ah I don't know what to do here."
1839,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!"
1840,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up behind Stan] Hey dudes. [Stan stands to one side so he can see Kyle clearly] Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
1841,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[looks at Cartman, then] Nothing"
1842,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[smiling proudly] Hngh, totally."
1843,9,8,Butters Stotch,"[appearing] Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! [the other kids present in the hall follow Butters away. Kyle goes as well.]"
1844,9,8,Eric Cartman,[throws down his cap] Aw crap!
1845,9,8,Mr Mackey,"Quiet, children, quiet! We need to hear."
1846,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming! [everyone gasps. A new graphic appears onscreen - a globe] It now appears that... all rumors of global warming were true. We were warned this would happen and ...we didn't listen! [buries his face in his hands in anguish] We didn't listen! [composes himself] All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting."
1847,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. [excited voices fill the room]"
1848,9,8,Geologist 1,"Excuse me, sir, but, ...when? When is this going to happen?"
1849,9,8,Randy Marsh,"My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. [excited voices fill the room again: ""Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots!""]"
1850,9,8,Geologist 2,"[an elderly gent] Excuse me, I'm sure we're all very impressed with your wild theories, Doctor uh, Marsh, but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed that global warming exists. Are you suggesting we shut down the economy?!"
1851,9,8,Randy Marsh,"With all due respect, cliché dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. [excited voices fill the room again: ""Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots!"" The double doors open]"
1852,9,8,Scientist 1,Listen! Listen! We've finished running the tests!
1853,9,8,Scientist 2,Global Warming is going to strike... two days before the day after tomorrow.
1854,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[alarmed] Oh my God... That's today! [a few seconds of silence, then all the geologists begin to panic. Papers fly around the room as most of the geologists run outside.]"
1855,9,8,Man 5,[runs by in front of the school] We didn't listen!
1856,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[pulls up in the family car, with everybody else already inside] Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!"
1857,9,8,Man 6,"[runs by in front of the camera] We didn't listen! [Wendy and her father run by, Anne and her mother run by.]"
1858,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[beeping his own horn] Come onnn, come on!"
1859,9,8,Sharon Marsh,It's useless. This traffic isn't moving!
1860,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all."
1861,9,8,Randy Marsh,"No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems."
1862,9,8,Driver,We didn't listen!
1863,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[hears this and rolls down his window] We, we didn't listen! [rolls up his window] Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! [the Marshes get out the car, carrying what they can, and leave the highway. In town the looting continues. An elderly man carrying a TV comes into view...]"
1864,9,8,Man 7,"[drops the TV and points] Oh Jesus, here it comes!"
1865,9,8,Man 8,"Global warming! [everyone runs away from whatever the man was pointing to, and soon the street is empty.]"
1866,9,8,Man 9,[in the middle of the crowd] It's coming! Here comes global warming!
1867,9,8,Man 1,"We didn't listen! [a camera in the sky begins to act the part of Global Warming as it focuses on a man and zooms in on him. The man turns and freezes in his tracks. The POV changes to a camera on the sidewalk watching the man's reactions. The man turns over a few times and stops moving, but no other camera is seen]"
1868,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[moving along with his family] Come on, hurry! [the panicking crowd overtakes them]"
1869,9,8,Man 11,"It's right behind us! [the Marshes stop to let the crowd through, then start moving again. The crowd returns and passes them again in the opposite direction] It's coming the other way! [the Marshes stop, then run back the way they came]"
1870,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Go back, go back!!"
1871,9,8,Stephen Stotch,Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!
1872,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[arrives to lend a hand] Get inside! We have to close these doors! [everyone for miles around comes and fills up the center. Again, the Global Warming camera focuses on the entrance and floats its way towards it. The last two people around, Stephen and Randy, close the doors just before the camera gets there.]"
1873,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming."
1874,9,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, are you all right?"
1875,9,8,Mrs Garrison,I'm in pretty bad shape. My... leg is broken and my... left boob is leaking
1876,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"[arrives with a blanket to wrap around Stan, who has a cot to sleep in, and is seated on it] Here you go, sweetheart."
1877,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood."
1878,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now."
1879,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Shh, shh! We've got the television working! [one of two TVs in front of the crowd comes to life]"
1880,9,8,Announcer,This is a FOX News update! Global Warming Disaster!
1881,9,8,Anchor,"Global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the Colorado Rockies! All around the country, panic and chaos are settling in!"
1882,9,8,Field Reporter Mitch,"Tom, I am standing just outside of Chicago, where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths. Already we're reporting that the death toll here in Chicago is over 600 billion people"
1883,9,8,Officer Barbrady,Oh God.
1884,9,8,Stephen Stotch,"[turns around in anger] This is all your fault, Jimbo!"
1885,9,8,Jimbo Kern,Me??
1886,9,8,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!"
1887,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[with a cup of water, approaches Stan] Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen."
1888,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it... it isn't global warming."
1889,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
1890,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[hops off his cot] Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood."
1891,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,How do you know that?
1892,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Because, I know what did cause the flood."
1893,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,George Bush?
1894,9,8,Stan Marsh,No.
1895,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Terrorists?
1896,9,8,Stan Marsh,No.
1897,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Communists?
1898,9,8,Stan Marsh,No.
1899,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Chinese radicals?
1900,9,8,Stan Marsh,No.
1901,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,...Cartman?
1902,9,8,Stan Marsh,...sort of.
1903,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,[throws down his cup] Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
1904,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[pulls him aside to a more private area] Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam."
1905,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinks a bit] Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now."
1906,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[arrives] Hey Stan. [studies Stan and Kyle's faces] Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!"
1907,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside."
1908,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!"
1909,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves."
1910,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,How?
1911,9,8,Eric Cartman,Why?
1912,9,8,Stan Marsh,"We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it."
1913,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[addressing the crowd] Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!"
1914,9,8,Mrs Garrison,"But... we need supplies, food, silicone."
1915,9,8,Randy Marsh,"You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate, [steps up to a laptop and presses a key. A rotating graph appears, with the graph line dipping low] bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!"
1916,9,8,Stephen Stotch,Jesus.
1917,9,8,Randy Marsh,"All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can."
1918,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,And... the rest of the country?
1919,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[sighs as he moves from the laptop to the blackboard and pulls out a marker] Everyone below this line [draws a line from the border of Colorado and New Mexico to West Virginia] will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line [draws a line from the border of Colorado and Montana to Lake Erie] is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out. [draws two lines connecting the two longer lines, around Indiana] The balmy southwestern states [draws an open circle around Arizona, most of New Mexico, California and Nevada] might have a chance but, New York [draws a short line around it] will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast. [the crowd looks at it for a long time, then a man puts his hand to his mouth and starts chuckling] What, Frank?! [Frank points at the inadvertent phallus Randy drew on the map. Randy looks and realizes what he did] Aw awww, Goddammit! [goes to scribble all over the map so the dong isn't so noticeable.]"
1920,9,8,Resident 1,"Hello? Anybody? We'd like to be rescued, please. Any day now."
1921,9,8,Resident 2,Why haven't they come for us?
1922,9,8,Resident 1,I... I don't know.
1923,9,8,Resident 3,"Wait, look! Here comes a boat!"
1924,9,8,Resident 2,Really? Oh! It's about time!
1925,9,8,Wife,"Oh Kevin, we're saved! [buries her face in his shoulder]"
1926,9,8,Resident 3,It looks like... three little boys.
1927,9,8,Resident 1,"Hey, we'll take it! [they all start waving their arms] Over here, yes! Thank you! Thank you! [the boys appear, going backwards and screaming. They head for Beaverton Oil, a refinery nearby, and crash into it. The boys fall out of the boat and into the water, then pop up right away. Oil begins to pour out of pipes the boat broke upon crashing, and fire follows the oil. The oil slick rushes past the flooded homes, with fire riding it, and a wall of flames rises up] Oh, thanks. Thanks. That's a LOT better."
1928,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,We can't get out! The flames are too big!
1929,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and heads towards Stan] Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle! [Kyle turns and looks at him] ""Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."""
1930,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks towards Stan] Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! [Stan looks down, unsure what to do]"
1931,9,8,Randy Marsh,Stan?? Stan!!
1932,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too!
1933,9,8,Sharon Marsh,Oh my God! Where would they go?!
1934,9,8,Stephen Stotch,"[on the public phone] Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone!"
1935,9,8,Randy Marsh,[gets to the phone and takes the receiver from Stephen] Stan??
1936,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hey Dad."
1937,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you're alive!"
1938,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!"
1939,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!"
1940,9,8,Stan Marsh,"No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something."
1941,9,8,Randy Marsh,"What is it, son?"
1942,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?"
1943,9,8,Randy Marsh,"You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! [hangs up the phone and struggles with his emotions, then grabs his coat and scarf and bundles up]"
1944,9,8,Mr Mackey,"Randy, wheh-where are you going?"
1945,9,8,Randy Marsh,I'm going to Beaverton.
1946,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,[Craig's father] You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
1947,9,8,Randy Marsh,My son is counting on me!
1948,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,I'm going with you.
1949,9,8,Randy Marsh,You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
1950,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,You can't do this alone!
1951,9,8,Stephen Stotch,Let me go too.
1952,9,8,Man 12,You can't go out there. You'll freeze to death.
1953,9,8,Randy Marsh,"All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find."
1954,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Stephen! [Stephen mumbles but can't get up] Stephen, you have to keep moving!"
1955,9,8,Stephen Stotch,I can't go on! Feel so... hot.
1956,9,8,Randy Marsh,Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
1957,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,Oh Jesus... [looking woozy] I feel warm too!
1958,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, me too. [walks around Gerald] Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! [bends down to help Stephen up]"
1959,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!"
1960,9,8,Randy Marsh,Don't be a fag! [turns around] Come on! We can make it! [the men move forward again] We have to try!
1961,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,"Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW!"
1962,9,8,Officer Barbrady,Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.
1963,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,"Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line! [the very line Randy mentioned]"
1964,9,8,Scientist,"E-excuse me, General?"
1965,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,WHAT??
1966,9,8,Scientist,"We've just compiled some new information. The er, the flood in Beaverton wasn't caused by global warming after all."
1967,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,What??
1968,9,8,Scientist,We know the truth now. We know what caused it! [hands the general a photo. The general looks at it and his eyes grow big]
1969,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!
1970,9,8,Eric Cartman,Help! Help! [a large drum falls from the ceiling in front of Kyle]
1971,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!"
1972,9,8,Stan Marsh,We have to find a way out! [the boys start climbing the metal stairs]
1973,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,"[through his bullhorn] Don't worry, everyone. The government is here to save you. [the helicopters hover above the homes and drop rope ladders down]"
1974,9,8,Resident 1,"Oh wow, thank you so much! What a swift and speedy rescue!"
1975,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! [another drom falls near Kyle, shearing off the stairs they just climbed. Kyle falls on his ass and gets up]"
1976,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!"
1977,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[stops before an opening in the wall, where he sees sky and...] It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! [Kyle and Cartman are on a landing below. Kyle tries to catch up to Stan, but Cartman blocks his way]"
1978,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Not so fast, Kyle."
1979,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing?
1980,9,8,Eric Cartman,Hand over the gold!
1981,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,What gold??
1982,9,8,Eric Cartman,You know what I'm talkng about!
1983,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!"
1984,9,8,Eric Cartman,All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
1985,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[drops down a few steps and calls] Guys, come on! [goes back up the stairs]"
1986,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
1987,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[pulls out a 9 mm handgun, hopefully fake.] I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!"
1988,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!"
1989,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!"
1990,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!"
1991,9,8,Eric Cartman,"I want... your Jew gold! [Kyle has run out of things to say and stands there. Cartman glowers at him, ready to fire the gun if he moves]"
1992,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"...Okay, fine! Here! [opens his coat and pulls out a small black bag, and hands it to Cartman] Now let's go!"
1993,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[moves the bag around for heaviness] Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!! [Kyle, angered at this delaying tactic, pulls out another small bag from under his coat and walks over to Cartman. Cartman laughs evilly as Kyle approaches. Kyle smiles an evil smile back and tosses the second bag over his shoulder and into the fire below. Cartman rushes over to grab it, but doesn't get there in time Kyle rushes up the stairs at the other end of the landing] No! Noooooo! [watches the fire]"
1994,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! [runs up to the platform and jumps on. The helicopter flies off]"
1995,9,8,Mr Mackey,"Hey, look everybody! Helicopters! [a few people move forward to catch a glimpse though a crack among the boards nailed against the entrance]"
1996,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"They, they've got the boys!"
1997,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,Global warming must be over!
1998,9,8,Man 13,"We made it! [the crowd cheers, ""We made it! Yeah! Woohoo""]"
1999,9,8,Sharon Marsh,Stanley! [stands next to him and goes down on one knee.]
2000,9,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle! [Randy, Gerald, and Stephen are still sprawled on the ground nearby.]"
2001,9,8,Randy Marsh,[raises his head] Stan? [turns to the other two men] We've found Stan! Ugh. [faints again]
2002,9,8,Mr Mackey,"So does, does this mean the storm is past. Global warming's over?"
2003,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,"Global warming didn't cause the Beaverton flood. We know now whose fault it is. [The boys look up. Stan is a little worried.] It was... [pulls out the picture he was handed earlier, and it's a crab person] Crab people!"
2004,9,8,Crowd,Ohhhh.
2005,9,8,Theme,"Crab People, Crab People, Taste like-"
2006,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[steps forward] Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. [the crowd falls silent for a few seconds]"
2007,9,8,Eric Cartman,...Aw man.
2008,9,8,Sharon Marsh,[steps forward] Stanley. You?
2009,9,8,Man 14,No. Don't you see what this child is saying? We can't spend all our energy placing blame when something bad happens. He's saying... we all broke the dam. '
2010,9,8,Stan Marsh,No. I broke the dam.
2011,9,8,Woman 1,I broke the dam.
2012,9,8,Man 15,I broke the dam.
2013,9,8,Man 16,I broke the dam.
2014,9,8,Stan Marsh,No. I broke the dam.
2015,9,8,Woman 2,And I broke the dam.
2016,9,8,Man 17,I broke the dam.
2017,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[steps forward] Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe."
2018,9,8,Man 18,I broke the dam.
2019,9,8,Woman 3,I broke the dam.
2020,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[annoyed that his admission isn't taking hold, adds emphasis] I broke the dam. I ran a boat into the dam and I broke it."
2021,9,8,Man 19,I broke the dam.
2022,9,8,Man 2,[deep voice] I broke the dam.
2023,9,8,Man 21,I broke the dam.
2024,9,8,Man 22,I broke the dam.
2025,9,8,Stan Marsh,No! I broke the fucking dam!
2026,9,8,Man 23,I broke the dam.
2027,9,8,Man 24,I broke the dam.
2028,9,8,Stan Marsh,I literally broke the dam!
2029,9,8,Man 25,I broke the dam.
2030,9,8,Man 26,I broke the dam.
2031,9,8,Stan Marsh,On a boat! That wasn't mine!
2032,9,8,Man 27,I broke the dam.
2033,9,8,Man 28,I broke the dam.
2034,9,8,Stan Marsh,"I kept it secret, for two days!"
2035,9,8,Man 29,I broke the dam.
2036,9,8,Man 3,I broke the dam.
2037,9,8,Stan Marsh,"The boat caught on fire, and it exploded!"
2038,9,8,Man 31,I broke the dam.
2039,9,8,Man 32,I broke the dam.
2040,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Ohhh, fuck it!"
2041,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,What are all you guys doing here?
2042,9,9,Clyde Donovan,I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. [shows letter]
2043,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, us too."
2044,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[closes the door and comes downstairs] Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge."
2045,9,9,Craig Tucker,What?
2046,9,9,Eric Cartman,"What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future."
2047,9,9,Stan Marsh,What?
2048,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,How do you know?
2049,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
2050,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"[in an English accent. Cartman looks on, startled] YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS! [bangs on the table twice with his fist] NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!"
2051,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true. [pulls TV from the back] I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera [shows the camera]. I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children."
2052,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Okay. I'm not lookin'. [buries his face in his arms]
2053,9,9,Eric Cartman,Video playback initialized. [presses play on the remote control and the screen shows the girls playing]
2054,9,9,Girls,[laugh]
2055,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!"
2056,9,9,Kale,Okay Bebe. What do you want to know?
2057,9,9,Bebe Stevens,I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.
2058,9,9,Kale,"Okay, let's find out. Ready? [pulls out a paper fortune teller] Pick a number."
2059,9,9,Bebe Stevens,Four.
2060,9,9,Kale,"One, two, three, four. Okay, pick a color."
2061,9,9,Bebe Stevens,Blue.
2062,9,9,Kale,B-L-U-E. All right pick another color
2063,9,9,Bebe Stevens,[off-screen]Red.
2064,9,9,Kale,"'Kaaay. Okay, will Bebe live in a big mansion in the future? [opens an interior flap] Definitely yes!"
2065,9,9,Bebe Stevens,All right!
2066,9,9,Girls,"Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!"
2067,9,9,Boys,Whoa! Wow!
2068,9,9,Red,Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute.
2069,9,9,Heidi Turner,I'll do it! I'll do it! [takes the teller from the Kal] Pick a number.
2070,9,9,Red,Three.
2071,9,9,Heidi Turner,"One, two, three. Now, pick a color."
2072,9,9,Clyde Donovan,Where did they get that thing? [Kyle shushes him]
2073,9,9,Heidi Turner,G-R-E-E-N.
2074,9,9,Red,Now blue!
2075,9,9,Heidi Turner,The answer is no. [girls laugh at her]
2076,9,9,Red,Aw dangit!
2077,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, how does it know the answer?"
2078,9,9,Craig Tucker,I... don't believe it.
2079,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image! [presses the pause button] Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device."
2080,9,9,Eric Cartman,[comes to Clyde and Kevin's table] How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?
2081,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with."
2082,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Good man.[goes over to the computer Kyle, Stan, and Token are working on] Any luck here?"
2083,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
2084,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it. [moves to the middle of the tent] All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here."
2085,9,9,Craig Tucker,Let's go take it!
2086,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?"
2087,9,9,Stan Marsh,So what do you suggest?
2088,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Heidi Turner [turns on a projector on which is shown her picture] is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it."
2089,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party."
2090,9,9,Eric Cartman,"No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town."
2091,9,9,Kevin Stoley,"You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?"
2092,9,9,Eric Cartman,"No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!"
2093,9,9,Stan Marsh,"But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went."
2094,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy."
2095,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
2096,9,9,Officer 1,Mr. and Mrs. Stotch?
2097,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Yes? What is it, officer?"
2098,9,9,Officer 1,You'd better come quick.
2099,9,9,Officer 2,Your son is at the Bowery Building threatening to kill himself.
2100,9,9,Linda Stotch,What?!
2101,9,9,Officer 3,Don't do it son! You have too much to live for! [a patrol car pulls up with Stephen and Linda]
2102,9,9,Linda Stotch,"Oh my God, Butters!"
2103,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Oh uh, hi Mom."
2104,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[behind Butters] Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. [Clyde, Stan, and Craig dress the pig while Cartman makes a Butter mask for it]"
2105,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[grabs the bullhorn from the officer] Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks."
2106,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too."
2107,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. [the pig is done, Butters steps down, and the pig is shoved into place]"
2108,9,9,Linda Stotch,"He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!"
2109,9,9,Officer 1,"No, wait. What... what's he doing? [the Butters mask appears over the ledge]"
2110,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay. One! Two! [Craig, Clyde, and Stan push the dressed pig]"
2111,9,9,Officer 3,"JEESUS CHIRST! [Linda screams. The pig drops to the ground and explodes, splattering everyone around with blood and guts]"
2112,9,9,Linda Stotch,OHHHH MY GOD!!
2113,9,9,Doctor,[walks up to the body and rests his finger on a completely exposed blood vein] He... didn't make it.
2114,9,9,Linda Stotch,NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!
2115,9,9,Eric Cartman,Nice.
2116,9,9,Priest Maxi,"And he shall be remembered as the peaceful little boy who warmed his parent's hearts. [Linda sobs uncontrollably] Lord, as we commit this child's body to the earth, may we ask it'd be the last child you strike down so mercilessly. We know this request to be futile, Lord, but just though we would ask. [the casket is lowered]"
2117,9,9,Linda Stotch,NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS! [jumps on the casket and Stephen and another woman holds her] Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!
2118,9,9,Ms Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters."
2119,9,9,Red,Who's Butters?
2120,9,9,Ms Garrison,"But we all must try to move on. And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to... Marjorine. [Butters enters dressed as Marjorine, a blonde girl, with wig askew]"
2121,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Oh... Thank you. [curtsies]
2122,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[whispers to Stan]Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. [clears his throat]"
2123,9,9,Ms Garrison,"Why don't you tell the children a little bit about yourself, Marjorine?"
2124,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and [squeezes his eyes shut] getting my snootch pounded on Friday night."
2125,9,9,Clyde Donovan,Nice.
2126,9,9,Ms Garrison,"Now Marjorine, that's not very ladylike. Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves."
2127,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Oh...
2128,9,9,Bebe Stevens,That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
2129,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[pretends like he's yawning]Dude, they totally think he's a girl. [coughs]"
2130,9,9,Ms Garrison,"All right, have a seat, Marjorine. I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to show you around the school. [the girls look cross] Won't you, girls?"
2131,9,9,Red,Where do you buy your clothes?
2132,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places."
2133,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[pretends like he's yawning]Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker. [coughs] This is going swimmingly. [coughs]"
2134,9,9,Mrs Turner,"[enters the basement carrying a bowl] Heidi, sweetie, I'm just gonna set the snacks over here."
2135,9,9,Heidi Turner,'Kay Mom.
2136,9,9,Mrs Turner,"Oh, and Heidi, there's going to be one extra girl coming to your slumber party."
2137,9,9,Heidi Turner,Who?
2138,9,9,Mrs Turner,"The new girl in your class, Marjorine."
2139,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Mom, I didn't invite her!"
2140,9,9,Mrs Turner,"I know, sweetie, but I got a call from Marjorine's mother."
2141,9,9,Heidi Turner,Her mother?
2142,9,9,Mrs Turner,"She said Marjorine is having a really hard time being in a new school. Her mom asked me personally if we could have Marjorine over, and besides, her mother told me that she works as a state official and that I should [slows down a bit] respect her authoratay."
2143,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Linda? Linda, please come downstairs."
2144,9,9,Linda Stotch,[through her tears]Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? [continues crying. Stephen leaves her alone and walks downstairs]
2145,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[sees Butters on a family portrait] Oh butter! Oh Butters, I miss you so much! [the doorbell rings and he opens the door]"
2146,9,9,An old farmer,Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.
2147,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Who are you?
2148,9,9,An old farmer,"[in a spooky accent]I came to talk you out of it. You need to... just accept that your son is dead, not try to bring him back."
2149,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Bring him back? W-What are you talking about?
2150,9,9,An old farmer,"[comes in] I know you're thinkin' of puttin'; him up there, the Indian Burial Ground up that road. You're thinking if you bury his body there, he will come back alive. Sometimes, dead is better."
2151,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Indian... Burial Ground?
2152,9,9,An old farmer,"It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. The Nelson boy, back in '85."
2153,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-"
2154,9,9,An old farmer,"Don't do it Stotch! What comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in. The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped using it when the ground went sour. I'm just here to talk you out of it. [walks towards the front door, which is still open, then turns around] Don't bury your son's body at the Indian Burial Ground, Stotch! The one that's right up over there, behind Andersons' bar. Sometimes... dead is better. [walks out]"
2155,9,9,Stan Marsh,"All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house."
2156,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"[dressed as Marjorine] I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?"
2157,9,9,Clyde Donovan,You're gonna be fine.
2158,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it."
2159,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
2160,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there."
2161,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
2162,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started."
2163,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"Good luck, man. [Kyle gives him a push, and Butters is off]"
2164,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out. [Kyle glares at him]"
2165,9,9,Mr Turner,"All right, now we all want you to have a good time. But as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you. There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any boys anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt. [Butters mumbles and sighs a bit] All right, have a nice time, girls. [both parents leave]"
2166,9,9,Heidi Turner,"So, what do you guys wanna do first?"
2167,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"We could play ""girl talk."" [the other girls approve]"
2168,9,9,Red,I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it. [the other girls approve again]
2169,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,How about we read each other's future?
2170,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"I know. Let's do ""Light as a feather, stiff as a board."" [the girls approve, then spread out. Kale and Emily light candles and place them on the rug. Bebe turns the lights off, and the girls gather, making a circle around the candles] Who wants to do it first?"
2171,9,9,Red,I will. [gets in the middle and lays down]
2172,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? [the girls look at Butters in astonishment for a moment, then they turn back to the center of the circle]"
2173,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Light as a feather, stiff as a board."
2174,9,9,Girls,"[getting louder as Red begins to float upwards] Light as a feather, stiff as a board! [Red is floating, making Butters scream]"
2175,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, what are they doing in there?"
2176,9,9,Eric Cartman,God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
2177,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! [Red floats back down, Bebe turn on the lights, and Heidi faces Butters]"
2178,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Marjorine, what is your problem?"
2179,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?"
2180,9,9,Red,"Yeah. I can tell your future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek."
2181,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, and your hair is totally stupid. [Butters looks at his hair ashamed]"
2182,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"Yeah, and you're flat! [Butters looks down at his chest]"
2183,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Marjorine, why don't you just leave? Nobody want you here!"
2184,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again. [begins shoveling dirt out of the way as the sky crackles with thunder and lightning. He finally reaches the coffin and opens it] There he is. There's my boy! Come on, Butters! [lifts the pig out of the coffin] Oh... Butters... you smell like... bacon [carries the carcass] Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back!"
2185,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,I think we went too far with Marjorine.
2186,9,9,Bebe Stevens,She's in the bathroom crying. [the girls move towards the bathroom]
2187,9,9,Heidi Turner,[knocks on bathroom door] Marjorine.
2188,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,[sobbing inside] Nobody likes meee...
2189,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"Aw gee, she's really upset."
2190,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school."
2191,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Marjorine? Marjorine? Hey, we didn't mean it."
2192,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,You don't know how hard it is to be me. [continues sobbing]
2193,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great."
2194,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,You think I'm ugly-ehehee...
2195,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"You're not ugly, Marjorine."
2196,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,You said I'm ugly and flat.
2197,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Marjorine, you just have a different look, that's all. We just... we need to help you bring out your inner beauty."
2198,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?"
2199,9,9,Girls,Yeah. Let's go!
2200,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,[opens the door] You mean it?
2201,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's been too long. Something's wrong.[Craig takes out binoculars to look]"
2202,9,9,Stan Marsh,Maybe they found him out.
2203,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"Then, he's already dead."
2204,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we gotta go check on him. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny move towards the house, reaching the storm cellar.]"
2205,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Can you see anything? [the boys see Butters dancing with the other girls to Justin Timberlake's song ""Rock Your Body""]"
2206,9,9,Stan Marsh,He's just dancing around.
2207,9,9,Eric Cartman,That son of a bitch!
2208,9,9,Mrs Turner,"Marjorine, sweetie your mom's on the phone."
2209,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,[stops dancing] My mom? [goes upstairs to the kitchen to answer the phone] Hello?
2210,9,9,Eric Cartman,Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
2211,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends."
2212,9,9,Eric Cartman,"You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device."
2213,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Well, I'm workin' on it."
2214,9,9,Eric Cartman,Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
2215,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom."
2216,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! [hangs up]"
2217,9,9,Red,"Hey Marjorine, you wanna know your future?"
2218,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?"
2219,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Sure. [hands the future teller to Butters, but doesn't take it yet] Here, you do my future."
2220,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,How?
2221,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Well uh you know, it's easy. You just put your thumbs and index fingers in here..."
2222,9,9,Mr Turner,Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party!
2223,9,9,Heidi Turner,There's a boy here?
2224,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"[moves towards the stairs pointing the future device] Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! [runs up the stairs and outside]"
2225,9,9,Craig Tucker,He got it! He got the device! [the boys surround Butters]
2226,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! [Clyde runs up, gets it, and runs off]"
2227,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Butters."
2228,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! [takes off his make up and runs off]"
2229,9,9,Heidi Turner,[appears at the doorway with her mom and dad and the other girls] What the hell?
2230,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! [turns around and runs as the other boys run away]"
2231,9,9,Heidi Turner,...Anybody have a piece of notebook paper so I can make another one?
2232,9,9,Jason White,"Go! Go! Get in the containment field! [Clyde enters it and takes the future device attached to a stick, to the incubation shield. He places it inside. A glass covers it and seals it. Clyde then takes off his clothes and enters a decontamination shower]"
2233,9,9,Linda Stotch,"Stephen, you did what??"
2234,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!"
2235,9,9,Linda Stotch,You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?
2236,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I!"
2237,9,9,Linda Stotch,"Not like this! [slows the voice down] Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! [knocks are heard on the front door and they both gasp]"
2238,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Hello?
2239,9,9,Stephen Stotch,It's him.
2240,9,9,Linda Stotch,Keep the door locked.
2241,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. [his parents are horrified]"
2242,9,9,Linda Stotch,"Oh God... [Butters knocks again, then tries to turn the doorknob.] No! [Butters keeps trying to open the door, Linda hides her face on Stephen's shoulder. Silence. Linda begins to cry]"
2243,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[soothes her] It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me."
2244,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"[enters through the back door] Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- [Linda screams and hides behind the couch]"
2245,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!"
2246,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me."
2247,9,9,Linda Stotch,It isn't right! Make it go away!
2248,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. [handles the future-telling device with black gloves]"
2249,9,9,Stan Marsh,Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
2250,9,9,Eric Cartman,"No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions."
2251,9,9,Clyde Donovan,How come you get to use it first?
2252,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Because I do, Clyde."
2253,9,9,Craig Tucker,I wanna use it.
2254,9,9,Eric Cartman,I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
2255,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,Wait! I don't wanna know that!
2256,9,9,Clyde Donovan,Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.
2257,9,9,Jason White,"Nah dude, then it won't be fun tow watch."
2258,9,9,Eric Cartman,Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
2259,9,9,Craig Tucker,"You shut up, asshole."
2260,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! [everyone starts arguing]"
2261,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Guys, guys, guys, stop! [everyone goes silent] Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now."
2262,9,9,Jason White,How could be nothing but trouble?
2263,9,9,Stan Marsh,We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
2264,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure."
2265,9,9,Craig Tucker,Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.
2266,9,9,Stan Marsh,And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
2267,9,9,Bradley Biggle,You mean destroy it?
2268,9,9,Eric Cartman,Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
2269,9,9,Stan Marsh,"We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are."
2270,9,9,Eric Cartman,Think of the power!
2271,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
2272,9,9,Eric Cartman,Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
2273,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. [Kenny presses the button, the device explodes, destroying the surrounding area; the explosion is seen from space. Cartman and Kenny get up covered in ashes]"
2274,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Damn, Ken."
2275,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son. [Butters is shown shackled by the neck with chains attached to the basement walls]"
2276,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Hi Dad.
2277,9,9,Linda Stotch,He was supposed to stay dead!
2278,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?"
2279,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination."
2280,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry."
2281,9,9,Linda Stotch,It's... hungry.
2282,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, it must feed."
2283,9,9,Rachel,"Hello, I'm Rachel with Quality Curtains."
2284,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[nervously] Oh yes, thank you for coming."
2285,9,9,Rachel,Which room are we looking at?
2286,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Just follow me to the basement.
2287,9,9,Linda Stotch,Yes. The basement.
2288,9,9,Rachel,"[Rachel enters the basement; she begins walking down the stairs] Oh my, it's pretty dark down here. You sure you need curtains? [sees Butters shackled up] Oh my God!"
2289,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Uh hello, I'm Butters."
2290,9,9,Rachel,"Little boy, what are you doing here? [Stephen kills Rachel with one hit of a shovel]"
2291,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Huh?
2292,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[shoves Rachel's corpse closer to Butters with the shovel] Here you go, son. Eat!"
2293,9,9,Linda Stotch,What are we becoming?!
2294,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Come on. Don't watch it eat. [they turn around and go up the stairs]
2295,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?
2296,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, children, this week we are all going to learn about parenting. [writes the word on the board.] I'm going to pair all the boys and girls in class into couples, and give each couple... [opens the carton of eggs and holds an egg up for the class to see] an egg. You must care for and look after this egg just like a baby for one full week. If you break your egg, it means you have a dead baby, and if you kill your baby, you get an F. When I announce your names, please move and sit with the person you're paired with. [on a magnetic board she has the girls listed on a table and the boys listed outside the table. She pairs the boys up with the girls as he calls them.] Heidi, you'll be with Eric."
2297,9,10,Heidi,[dissatisfied] Awww!
2298,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Annie, you'll be a family with Timmy."
2299,9,10,Timmy Burch,Timmiih!
2300,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Millie, your husband is Craig. Powder, you and Kenny are a loving couple now."
2301,9,10,Stan Marsh,"[worried] Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy."
2302,9,10,Kenny McCormick,(So?)
2303,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Aaand let's see who else we have here, uh..."
2304,9,10,Stan Marsh,"So, I haven't even spoken to Wendy since we broke up."
2305,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"And, Wendy? Wendy will be with Kyle."
2306,9,10,Stan Marsh,Kyle??
2307,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Bebe, you're paired up with Stan. Lola and Token, Red and Craig, and Esther and Bradley. [the kids begin to pair up. Mrs. Garrison begins to distribute the eggs] Now, I'm going to sign each of your eggs myself, so that we'll know it's the same one at the end of the week. That way if anybody cheats and tries to replace their eggs, we'll know, Eric. [gives him a stern look] All you have to do is make it to Friday with your egg unharmed to prove what great little parents you are. [Token is somewhat shocked that he got a brown egg. Mrs. Garrison returns to the front of the class] Okay children, you can now take the rest of the school period to decorate your egg however you wish. Good luck, and remember, a dead baby means an F for the parents. [the kids begin decorating their eggs, and music begins to play]
[seated at his desk gazing at the students, daydreaming]
Just look at all these little families
Newfound couples in a happy home.
It takes me back to another time
When I had a love of my own. [holds in her hands a signed portrait of Mr. Slave]

[bolts up and starts singing aloud]
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
[picking flowers in a meadow]
Love, so darn frail, you know? It shriveled and died. I don't know how.

[Stan wanders through the neighborhood with hands in his pockets and reaches Wendy's place. He looks through a window and sees Kyle and Wendy working on their assignment in the kitchen. Mr. Garrison appears next to him]
Love, love lost long ago, it was special then, it's over now.
[prances through town and stops at a bridal shop. She imagines himself as the bride]
Guess that I'll never know how it all went wrong. How how how? 
[sits on her bed holding the portrait, then decides to drive to Mr. Slave's house.]
Well perhaps I should try and boldly go and rekindle that love lost long ago.
[steps out of his car, goes up to the doorbell, and rings it. Mr. Slave opens there, then expresses a muted surprise] Hello, Mr. Slave. [bats her eyes at him]"
2308,9,10,Mr Slave,"Mr. Garrison! Ohoh, Jezuth!"
2309,9,10,Mrs Garrison,[sweetly] Just let me say what I came here to say. I know we had a falling out and... things were said that... shouldn't have been said. I want to apologize for calling you a faggot.
2310,9,10,Mr Slave,"That's, that's wonderful, Mr. Garrison!"
2311,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Well, wait, wait, it gets better. I've forgiven you for walking out on me after I had my sex change, and uh... [gushes] And I'm ready to take you back, Mr. Slave!"
2312,9,10,Mr Slave,Ooooo...
2313,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Well, give us a kiss!"
2314,9,10,Big Gay Al,"[appearing in the background] Say, honey, is that the pizza? [Mrs. Garrison is dismayed that it's Big Gay Al Mr. Slave is with]"
2315,9,10,Mrs Garrison,[storms inside] What the hell is he doing here?!
2316,9,10,Mr Slave,"Mr. Garrison, Al and I have been living together for a few months."
2317,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Well, that didn't take you long, did it?!"
2318,9,10,Big Gay Al,"Slave, should I leave you two alone?"
2319,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Yes!
2320,9,10,Mr Slave,"No! [walks over to Big Gay Al and stands next to him] Mr. Garrison, there's something you should know. Al and I are getting married."
2321,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Married?!
2322,9,10,Big Gay Al,[holds Mr. Slave's hand] Yes.
2323,9,10,Mrs Garrison,You can't get married! You're faggots!
2324,9,10,Mr Slave,"[puts his hand to his forehead] Oh, Jesus Christ."
2325,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Mr. Slave, I am legally a woman now! If you wanna get married, you have to marry ME!"
2326,9,10,Big Gay Al,Oh that's not true! Colorado is about to pass a bill which allows same-sex marriage.
2327,9,10,Mr Slave,We're getting married right after the bill passes on Saturday.
2328,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Oh, that's just great! They're gonna let queers and homos get married, huh?!"
2329,9,10,Mr Slave,"Okay, that's enough. Out, Mr. Garrison."
2330,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"We'll just see about this, you fudge-packin' fags!! I'll stop that gay-marriage law! [turns and leaves for the front door]"
2331,9,10,Mr Slave,"Oh my God, you're just saying that because you're jealous."
2332,9,10,Mrs Garrison,[turns around] Jealous of what?! I'm doin' this out of principle! To protect the sanctity of marriage! [backs up towards the front door] Fags are gettin' married over MY DEAD BODY!! [slams the door shut. Mr. Slave and Al look at each other]
2333,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hello? Oh hey dude.
2334,9,10,Stan Marsh,"So, what are you and Wendy doing?"
2335,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A."
2336,9,10,Stan Marsh,Uh huh...
2337,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
2338,9,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, well, so is your hat. [hangs up and sets the phone down. Kyle is puzzled, Stan is upset. The doorbell rings and Stan goes to answer it]"
2339,9,10,Bebe Stevens,"[holding their egg] Stan, I need you to watch the egg for a while."
2340,9,10,Stan Marsh,I can't. I'm busy.
2341,9,10,Bebe Stevens,I've been looking after it all day. I have to go to the hair salon and the candy store!
2342,9,10,Stan Marsh,...So take it with you!
2343,9,10,Bebe Stevens,"Stan, this is our egg. We're both supposed to take care of it."
2344,9,10,Stan Marsh,"[crosses his arms, turns around and goes inside] Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!"
2345,9,10,Bebe Stevens,"[follows him in] Well whether you wanted to or not doesn't really matter now! We're going to get graded together! It's your egg too! Own up to your responsibilities! [leaves the egg with him and walks out. Stan stands there with the egg for a few moments, then sits on the sofa and tosses the egg aside. He turns on the TV to catch an episode of ""One Day At A Time""]"
2346,9,10,Mrs Garrison,These homosexuals think they can just step all over our traditions! Well I say: Marriage is a holy sacrament between a man and a woman! [the crowd applauds]
2347,9,10,Woman,Who is that lady?
2348,9,10,Man,"I don't know, but she is pissed."
2349,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"They passed this law behind our back! We need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay! That homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions! And there is only one way for us, all together, to make that message very clear! We need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin' hell out of them! [Everyone else falls silent. She steps out from behind the podium and crouches a bit] Come on, everybody! Let's get some queers, and some trucks, and have us a good old-fashioned fag drag!"
2350,9,10,Man 2,"Well uh, we were thinkin' we would, you know, just go appeal to the Governor."
2351,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Appeal to the Governor? Oh,come on! Where's your balls?! Fag drag!"
2352,9,10,Man 3,"We don't ""hate"" homosexuals, we, we we just don't want them to be able to marry."
2353,9,10,Man 4,"Yeah, we were just thinkin' o' goin' and askin' the Governor to veto the bill."
2354,9,10,Man 5,Yeah.
2355,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[looking all alone now] Eh fah, fag drag?"
2356,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Governor, we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gay-marriage bill!"
2357,9,10,Governor of Colorado,"[with emotion] Oh jeez, I knew this would happen. First the gay people come in here wanting equal rights, then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to veto it. [slams his right fist on his desk]> Why do I have to make this decision?? />"
2358,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Because you're the governor?
2359,9,10,Governor of Colorado,"I just wanted a big house and lots of respect. I didn't want this kind of responsibility. [rises form his desk and turns away, walking towards a window] I mean, I don't know anything about gay marriage. What argument can I use to deny them their right to a family?"
2360,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Well, think of the children! If you allow gays to get married, then you're also givin' them full rights as parents to adopt. You think kids can be raised by queers??"
2361,9,10,Governor of Colorado,I can't use that argument. There's never been a study done which proves that either way.
2362,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[gets an idea] But, if you had such a study, a scientific study which proved same-sex couples are incapable of raising a child..."
2363,9,10,Governor of Colorado,Then I would have something to fall back on. So-something to take all the pressure off of me.
2364,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[confidently] Mr. Governor, I will get you that study."
2365,9,10,Bebe Stevens,"Hey Wendy, how's your egg doing?"
2366,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. [beams at Kyle. Stan looks on, miffed]"
2367,9,10,Bebe Stevens,"Yeah. [gets angry] I wish I had a partner like Kyle! I went to go pick up the egg from Stan yesterday, and his dog had it in its mouth! Our egg isn't gonna last a week with Stan around!"
2368,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[enters with four big books and drops them on her desk] Okay, students, change of plan! [walks over to the magnetic chalkboard] You've all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs, but now we're going to mix it up a little. Wendy and Kyle will no longer be together."
2369,9,10,Stan Marsh,[points at Kyle] HA!
2370,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Let's see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg, shall we?! Kyle, you are now with Stan! And Wendy is with Bebe! [Kyle and Wendy exchange glances]"
2371,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
2372,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Come on, Bebe. We'll take your egg for you and Wendy to look after."
2373,9,10,Bebe Stevens,"Oh, goodie. [moves over to take a seat next to Wendy]"
2374,9,10,Mrs Garrison,And we'll just take this egg for Stan and Kyle to look out for. [takes Wendy's egg...]
2375,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,"No. No, that's my egg."
2376,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Wendy, we're doing an experiment. [...and gives her Bebe's egg...] Here you go, boys. [...and gives Wendy's egg to the boys]"
2377,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,"But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it."
2378,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[ebullient] Hoh now, what makes you say that, Wendy? I'm sure two boys can handle an egg just fine... [goes towards the chalkboard, scheming] And if not, we'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned Governor, won't we?"
2379,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Who?
2380,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[shifty] Never mind, just carry on, children. Just carry on as two reckless little boys will."
2381,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked."
2382,9,10,Stan Marsh,"Alright, give it to me. I'll take it home tonight."
2383,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?"
2384,9,10,Stan Marsh,[suspicious] Why do you say that?
2385,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg."
2386,9,10,Stan Marsh,That's because I was pissed off!
2387,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,At who? [the doorbell rings] Heh- hang on. [goes to answer the door and finds Wendy outside]
2388,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,[wistfully] I wanna see my egg.
2389,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
2390,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,[enunciates] I want to see my egg.
2391,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Wendy, it isn't your egg anymore!"
2392,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Yes it is. I made it, I decorated it."
2393,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!"
2394,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.
2395,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[consoles her a bit, but turns her away] Wendy, I just wanna get an A, okay? Let's not make this any more confusing than it already is. <>[Stan peeks out from the kitchen and sees Kyle's arm around Wendy]"
2396,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Don't let anything happen to it, please. [Stan gets upset and disappears back into the kitchen]"
2397,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Wendy, nothing's gonna happen to the egg. You can have it when the week is over and I have my grade. [slams the door on her and returns to the kitchen, where an angry Stan is sitting in his chair with his arms crossed] Freakin' weirdos, man."
2398,9,10,Stan Marsh,"You think you're so great, don't you?! Well guess what?! Maybe I don't need your help! I'm taking the egg home tonight, and I'm gonna show everybody tomorrow that I'm every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you! [hops off the chair and rushes out the side door]"
2399,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is wrong with everybody?
2400,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, children, it's Wednesday! Time for an official egg check! Heidi and Eric?"
2401,9,10,Heidi,Our egg is fine.
2402,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[writes OK on their row] Okay, Annie and Timmy?"
2403,9,10,Timmy Burch,TimmiIH!
2404,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[writes OK on their row] Good. Millie and Clyde, I saw yours before class. [writes OK on their row] Powder and Kenny?"
2405,9,10,Kenny McCormick,(Our egg is okay.)
2406,9,10,Mrs Garrison,[writes OK on their row] Now how about our gay couples? Stan and Kyle?
2407,9,10,Stan Marsh,"[determined, willful] Fine!"
2408,9,10,Mrs Garrison,What?
2409,9,10,Stan Marsh,No problems at all!
2410,9,10,Mrs Garrison,[turns around in anger] That's impossible! [snatches the egg from Stan's hand and looks it over carefully] Are you sure you didn't break it and switch eggs on me?! Where's my signature?!
2411,9,10,Stan Marsh,"It's right there, see? [leans towards Kyle in fear. Wendy looks down and away from the action]"
2412,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Two boys can't possibly take care of an egg!
2413,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's totally fine."
2414,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"It isn't fine! It has two daddies! You call that fine?! It may be fine on the outside, but inside it's confused and embarrassed! Look at the freak egg! It has two daddies! [taunts the egg directly] Two daddies! Two daddies! Come on, class, let's rip on the freak egg! Two daddies! Two daddies!"
2415,9,10,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the Governor's office, where in just two days, the Governor can either sign or veto the new bill allowing gay marriage. Same-sex couples from all over the state have shown up in support, [Mr. Slave and Big Gay Al are there] while dissenters have also converged. The governor is about to give a statement."
2416,9,10,Governor of Colorado,"I believe that I might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy! People in the gay community want the same rights as married couples, but dissenters don't want the word ""marriage"" corrupted. So how about we let gay people get married, but call it something else? [everyone listens quietly] You homosexuals will have all exactly the same rights as married couples, but instead of referring to you as ""married,"" you can be... butt buddies. [long silence] Instead of being ""man and wife,"" you'll be... butt buddies. You won't be ""betrothed,"" you'll be... butt buddies. Get it? Instead of a ""bride and groom,"" you'd be... butt buddies."
2417,9,10,Mr Slave,We wanna be treated equally!
2418,9,10,Governor of Colorado,"Y-you are equal. It's just that instead of getting ""engaged,"" you would be... butt buuuddies. And everyone is happy!"
2419,9,10,Woman,Well what about lesbians?!
2420,9,10,Governor of Colorado,"Well like anyone cares about fuckin' dykes. [the crowd goes into an uproar] Oh, God, I was sure that would work."
2421,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Damnit, damnit! Stan and Kyle's egg is still doin' fine! Those little assholes are screwin' up my entire plan! [there's a knock on the classroom door] Yes, what?! [Cartman walks in with his shattered egg and sits on the chair next to the desk. He places the egg on the desk, crosses his arms and looks away. Mrs. Garrison looks at the egg and is dismayed] What the hell is this?!"
2422,9,10,Eric Cartman,I broke the egg.
2423,9,10,Mrs Garrison,You broke your egg?? Uh but you're partnered with a girl.
2424,9,10,Eric Cartman,"I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg."
2425,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Did you tell anyone else about this?
2426,9,10,Eric Cartman,...No.
2427,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Did you tell your egg partner, Heidi?"
2428,9,10,Eric Cartman,"No. That's why I'm here. I think you should still give Heidi an A on the project. You see, I broke the egg, not her. And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us."
2429,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"I can't do that, Eric!"
2430,9,10,Eric Cartman,Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
2431,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"You have to get an A, Eric. Here: I'll sign this new egg for you. We'll pretend this never happened, all right? [goes about making a duplicate egg for Cartman] Just... put on the old hair, color in the same eyes... There we go, good as new. [places it near Cartman and puts the shattered one in his desk drawer] Go enjoy the rest of your recess."
2432,9,10,Eric Cartman,"[thinks about what just happened] Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before."
2433,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"...Okay, well, you're welcome, Eric. Now, just run along. [continues grading papers]"
2434,9,10,Eric Cartman,...Why are you doing this?
2435,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Because I'm a nice teacher, all right?"
2436,9,10,Eric Cartman,What do you want from me?
2437,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Nothing! It's all okay! Just take your damn egg!
2438,9,10,Eric Cartman,...No.
2439,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[quickly grabs Cartman by the collar] Eric, you've never been anything but a problem for me! You're taking that egg! And if you break it again, I'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me?!"
2440,9,10,Eric Cartman,[choking] Yes teacher.
2441,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[releases him] Get out of my face! [Eric gets his new egg and rushes out of the classroom] Urrgh, this scientific study isn't turning out the way I planned! Looks like I'm gonna have to... intervene."
2442,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Are you Jakartha?
2443,9,10,Jakartha,Who the hell are you?!
2444,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Mrs. Garrison. I spoke to your associates on the telephone.
2445,9,10,Jakartha,"Ahh yes, you are interested in my services."
2446,9,10,Mrs Garrison,I have a little... problem I need taken care of. I heard you're the best.
2447,9,10,Jakartha,"Who do you want me to kill? [Mrs. Garrison pulls out a photo from her purse and puts it face down on the table, then slides it towards Jakartha. Jakartha picks it up and looks at it. It's a picture of Stan and Kyle's egg] What is this?"
2448,9,10,Mrs Garrison,It's an egg.
2449,9,10,Jakartha,You want me to kill an egg?
2450,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"I can pay two thousand now, three more when the job is finished."
2451,9,10,Jakartha,What do you expect me to do with it?
2452,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"I don't care. Scramble it, fry it, do what you will! It has to look like an accident."
2453,9,10,Jakartha,I am a serious assassin! Get out of my face!
2454,9,10,Mrs Garrison,What's the matter? You... afraid you can't do it? Can't say that I blame ya. That egg has caused me nothin' but problems since day one! [rises and steps away from the table] I guess... you're not as good as they say you are...
2455,9,10,Jakartha,[jabs a Bowie knife into the table and rises violently] I am the greatest killer the world has ever seen!!
2456,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Then why are you scared of one little egg?!
2457,9,10,Jakartha,I will murder that egg! Then I will make it curse the day it was laid!
2458,9,10,Mrs Garrison,That's more like it!
2459,9,10,Stan Marsh,"Day five. I made it! [the phone rings, and he answers] Hello?"
2460,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, did you hear what's happening?"
2461,9,10,Stan Marsh,What?
2462,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
2463,9,10,Stan Marsh,Governor's office?
2464,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?"
2465,9,10,Stan Marsh,"Aah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?! I took care of this egg, Kyle, not you!"
2466,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!"
2467,9,10,Stan Marsh,"What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!"
2468,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Impress Wendy??
2469,9,10,Stan Marsh,You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
2470,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you talking about?!
2471,9,10,Stan Marsh,"Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say ""See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is."" [a laser dot snakes its way up the egg. Stan notices this with some surprise, and the egg explodes in his hand. Some of it lands on his face and cap. Jakartha appears behind the bushes across the street and lowers his sniper rifle]"
2472,9,10,Jakartha,Almost too easy. [drops down and crawls away]
2473,9,10,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
2474,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Stan?
2475,9,10,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
2476,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan? Stan, I think we should talk."
2477,9,10,Stan Marsh,"[softly crying, muffled] Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy."
2478,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, I don't like Wendy. [Stan's raises his head and listens] All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!"
2479,9,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser."
2480,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
2481,9,10,Stan Marsh,I don't. She's totally lame. [he drops his head into his arms again.]
2482,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I. [Stan's raises his head again] I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend."
2483,9,10,Stan Marsh,"[hops off his chair and approaches Kyle, head down] I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have."
2484,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either."
2485,9,10,Stan Marsh,Huh?
2486,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away and walks a few paces] It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you [reaches into his jacket and pulls out an egg] and kept the original safe with me."
2487,9,10,Stan Marsh,That... [walks up to Kyle and points at the egg] That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
2488,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
2489,9,10,Stan Marsh,Then... then Wendy won't think I'm a total loser!
2490,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. And I can still get my A!
2491,9,10,Stan Marsh,"Come on, buddy, let's go! [walks happily towards his door. Kyle steps forward, then stops]"
2492,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan... [Stan turns, then he turns away] Do you really think my hat is stupid?"
2493,9,10,Stan Marsh,"[walks back and puts his left hand on Kyle's shoulder] As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known. [Kyle smiles and Stan pats him twice on the back] Come on! [they head out]"
2494,9,10,Governor of Colorado,"Today is a very big day in which I'm supposed to make a very big decision. As some of you know, my biggest issue with gay marriage regards child-rearing. And a new study has just been concluded which will give me the ability to take no personal responsibility in this decision."
2495,9,10,Big Gay Al,A new study?
2496,9,10,Governor of Colorado,Here with the results of that study is the lovely Mrs. Garrison. [steps aside and gives her the podium.]
2497,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[floats in like a diva] Thank you, Governor."
2498,9,10,Mr Slave,"[strokes his temple] Oh, Jesus Christ."
2499,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Ladies and Gentlemen, with the help of some adorable fourth-grade students, we've completed our scientific, non-biased study of fags having kids. Come on up, children. [the kids file into view and spread out before the podium. Jakartha shows up as well and stands next to the white chalkboard.] The parents were grouped together as male and female. As you can see..."
2500,9,10,Aide,"[rushes up with a phone] Uh, Mrs. Garrison. You have an emergency phone call."
2501,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"[takes the phone and answers] Yes, what is it?! I'm a little busy!"
2502,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[in the back seat of a speeding cab with Stan] Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!"
2503,9,10,Mrs Garrison,[turns away from the mic] What?? Y-your... you're too late!
2504,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
2505,9,10,Mrs Garrison,No you can'- Hello? Hello!! [hauls Jakartha into view by the lapel] You told me you killed that freak egg!!
2506,9,10,Jakartha,I was sure I did!
2507,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"Well it's here! You'd better make damn sure it doesn't reach these steps uncracked! [shoves him away and returns to the mic] Haha, anyhow, as I was saying, we put one egg into the hands of two male students. [far away from the podium the cab screeches to a stop and the left back door opens. Stan hops out]"
2508,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,[pays the cabbie] Thanks dude! [hops out behind Stan]
2509,9,10,Stan Marsh,"There! Over there! [they run through the crowd, taking care the egg doesn't fall out and break] Excuse us! Excuse us please!"
2510,9,10,Jakartha,"[runs alongside them, aiming at the egg] Yeeeeaah! [opens fire. People begin to fall away left and right]"
2511,9,10,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
2512,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Keep running! [other people hear the gunfire and look around]
2513,9,10,Mrs Garrison,The the egg that the two boys were given just-
2514,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hang on! Wait! [Jakartha bumps someone aside and starts detonating hidden bombs around the plaza. Groups of people are thrown off in all directions. The Governor begins to pay attention]
2515,9,10,Mrs Garrison,"In conclusion, Governor, you can rest assured that-! [one last blast is especially deadly. The area fills with dark brown smoke. As the smoke clears, Stan and Kyle hobble towards the podium, tattered clothes and all]"
2516,9,10,Stan Marsh,"[tired, voice breaking] Teacher, our egg is... okay. [falls onto his back and passes out, holding the egg high for all to see]"
2517,9,10,Governor of Colorado,[kneels to inspect the egg] This egg is fine. [rises and steps forth] Gays can get married! [everyone cheers and gay couples hug each other in celebration.]
2518,9,10,Mrs Garrison,Noo! Noooo!!
2519,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,[still woozy] Gays can get married? What??
2520,9,10,Fr Maxi,"I now pronounce you man... and man. [both men, Al and Slave, are wearing wedding dresses. They turn to face each other and kiss on the lips. Everyone present cheers, and Mr. Slave and Al run down the aisle to their new life together. Stan and Kyle appear as the crowd disperses]"
2521,9,10,Randy Marsh,"[walks up and kneels next to Stan] Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. [rises and walks away. Wendy walks up]"
2522,9,10,Kyle Broflovski,[still confused] What did we do?
2523,9,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad."
2524,9,10,Stan Marsh,"[smugly] Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. [Wendy's face falls, then she turns and walks away sadly.]"
2525,9,11,Token Black,"Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. [the projector turns off and Token takes his seat as Timmy claps a little]"
2526,9,11,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Token. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have ah Eric."
2527,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to the front of the class and turns around, looking at his paper] Thank you, Mrs. Garrison. [reads] My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles."" [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids. [cues up his pics. A red-headed boy appears] Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles. [next picture is of a girl licking her triple-scoop ice-cream cone] Aw, nasty! Yuck! [returns to his paper] This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls."
2528,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,[annoyed at Cartman's ignorance] What?!
2529,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured. [another redheaded girls pops up] Ah sick! [another redhead] Gross! [another redhead] Yeck! [returns to his paper] Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike... [a picture of a vampire with a full moon and bats behind him pops up] vampires."
2530,9,11,Class,Aaaah.
2531,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!"
2532,9,11,Eric Cartman,"I was getting to that, if you will let me. [returns to his paper] Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers."" [cues up a picture of Kyle, with ""daywalkers"" written underneath]"
2533,9,11,Butters Stotch,Ho! Daywalkers!
2534,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,This is all a bunch of crap!
2535,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions..."
2536,9,11,Mrs Garrison,"Kyle, let Eric give his presentation."
2537,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!"
2538,9,11,Clyde Donovan,[glances around] I am.
2539,9,11,Mrs Garrison,"Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!"
2540,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Fine, I will! [crosses his arms]"
2541,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth! [Kyle grits his teeth and growls, trying to contain himself] Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, [next picture: a boy with a few missing front teeth] and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one, [the last pic is that of Carrot Top] think again. [the bell rings and the kids file out of the classroom.]"
2542,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Stupid supremacist asswipe!
2543,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what's the big deal?"
2544,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?"
2545,9,11,Stan Marsh,[thinks a moment] What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
2546,9,11,Three kids,Hello?
2547,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
2548,9,11,Girl,[the middle child] Sure. Come on in. [waves them in. They enter]
2549,9,11,Boy,"[the oldest child] Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us."
2550,9,11,Father,"What? Heh, hello there, kids."
2551,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles."
2552,9,11,Father,"[nervous throughout] Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals."
2553,9,11,Stan Marsh,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes."
2554,9,11,Father,"Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds? [breaks down and sobs into his hands]"
2555,9,11,Mother,"A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know. [her husband stops sobbing and raises his head] If your spouse is also a carrier, then your children can turn out like... them. [they both look at the kids, who smile and grin]"
2556,9,11,Father,Each one of them's a blessing.
2557,9,11,Mother,"Oh yes, each one of them's a blessing."
2558,9,11,Father,Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.
2559,9,11,Three kids,"[grinning] Thanks, Mom and Dad."
2560,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. [somber music plays]
2561,9,11,Father,"No... no, I'm sure they do. [quickly rises and shows the boys to the door] Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started."
2562,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,I just had a couple more questions about-
2563,9,11,Father,"Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene. [looks right and left] I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason. [closes the door on them and they turn around]"
2564,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul, [Cartman yawns] but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. [turns off the projector and goes to his desk amid some applause]"
2565,9,11,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go. [the bell rings] All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess."
2566,9,11,Butters Stotch,"That was a very informative speech, Kyle."
2567,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks Butters
2568,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Informative if you want to die. [hops off his seat and joins Butters and Kyle] Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all. [moves towards the door] Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! [points at Clyde, who jumps back.]"
2569,9,11,Stan Marsh,You buying school lunch today?
2570,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch."
2571,9,11,Clyde Donovan,"[off screen] Right this way! [the camera shows four boys - Craig, Jimmy, Clyde and Token - kicking a redhead out] You can't eat in the cafeteria! [Craig crosses his arms]"
2572,9,11,Boy,How come?
2573,9,11,Token Black,Ginger kids eat in the hallway!
2574,9,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard! [the redhead walks off and the other four boys go back inside the cafeteria]"
2575,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
2576,9,11,Stan Marsh,"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger."
2577,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,[thinks] Hey. [snaps his fingers] That's a great idea!
2578,9,11,Kenny McCormick,(What's a great idea?)
2579,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
2580,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Sure, for what?"
2581,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
2582,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Okay dude, knock him out. [Kyle takes out a small club and starts beating Cartman with it. After five blows Stan rushes over to stop him] Dude, dude okay, he's out! [with the club gone, Kyle resorts to punching Cartman out] Kyle, that's good! [Kenny puts his ear to the door and listens for any activity in the hallway] All right, let's do it."
2583,9,11,Liane Cartman,"Eric honey, time to get up for school. [heads back to the kitchen downstairs. Cartman rolls over and wakes up, hops down and leaves his room]"
2584,9,11,Eric Cartman,"-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-"
2585,9,11,Liane Cartman,"[hears him and drops the spatula] Poopsiekins! [rushes back to the restroom, leaving her eggs cooking. Cartman checks his face thoroughly, but continues to scream. Liane arrives and enters] Sweetie, what is the- [he turns around and she screams] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
2586,9,11,Eric Cartman,I'M GINGER!
2587,9,11,Liane Cartman,Oh my God! Eric!
2588,9,11,Eric Cartman,Help me! Hellp mee!
2589,9,11,Doctor,"Well, all his vital signs are still normal. From his outward appearance, I would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency."
2590,9,11,Liane Cartman,You mean...
2591,9,11,Doctor,"Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus."
2592,9,11,Eric Cartman,And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
2593,9,11,Doctor,"Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence."
2594,9,11,Eric Cartman,So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
2595,9,11,Doctor,"[puts a hand on Cartman's back] I'm sorry, son. [takes Liane aside] Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you? [walks a few steps with Liane] Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down."
2596,9,11,Liane Cartman,Oh... [looks away. Cartman hops off the bed and walks up and stands between them.]
2597,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like! [crosses his arms] Right, Mom?! [a bit shocked when she doesn't answer right away] Mom?!"
2598,9,11,Liane Cartman,"Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie."
2599,9,11,Doctor,"All right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy."
2600,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey dudes, what's goin' on? [coughs to clear his throat] How is everything with you guys?"
2601,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, Cartman. You look... different."
2602,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency."
2603,9,11,Stan Marsh,"You mean,you're a ginger?"
2604,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Actually, gingervitus is the medical term."
2605,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Is that an umbrella you're using?
2606,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Kyle. [coughs] The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal."
2607,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Stan for a moment] ...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?"
2608,9,11,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, Kyle?"
2609,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one."
2610,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[thinks] Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. [the school bus pulls up and opens its doors. The kids climb in and find seats]"
2611,9,11,Eric Cartman,"That's fine, just get it out of the way..."
2612,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this is going awesome."
2613,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. [Butters strokes his nose, then takes out a napkin to wipe away tears from the laughter, then sighs, only to resume laughing, harder. Cartman just folds his arms across his chest and looks away]"
2614,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[Walks up to an empty space between Clyde and Token] Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? [begins to eat]"
2615,9,11,Token Black,What are you doing?
2616,9,11,Eric Cartman,I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
2617,9,11,Clyde Donovan,You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
2618,9,11,Eric Cartman,Huh?
2619,9,11,Craig Tucker,You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
2620,9,11,Eric Cartman,But... it's me.
2621,9,11,Clyde Donovan,"Right. And you're a ginger. [at a nearby table, Stan is about to eat his burger, but Kyle softly jabs him]"
2622,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, check it out. [Stan looks over]"
2623,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. [the camera looks around at the other kids at the table, who remain silent]"
2624,9,11,Clyde Donovan,"Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming."
2625,9,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, beat it, j... jackass. [Cartman is stunned, but takes his tray and walks away. He walks past Kyle, Stan, and Kenny.]"
2626,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers."
2627,9,11,Eric Cartman,"I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!"
2628,9,11,Boy,Yeah!
2629,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!"
2630,9,11,Older Boy,My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.
2631,9,11,Eric Cartman,"...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like... [he can't think of any] Like uh... [looks up in thought, then softly] Liiike..."
2632,9,11,Girl,Ron Howard?
2633,9,11,Eric Cartman,Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
2634,9,11,Older Boy,Ron Howard? [the other redheads look at him]
2635,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!"
2636,9,11,Ginger Kids,Yeah!
2637,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power! [Stan stops the game and the boys look at the source of commotion. Cartman leads the gingers across the playground]
2638,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2639,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
2640,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2641,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
2642,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2643,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
2644,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2645,9,11,Eric Cartman,"We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!"
2646,9,11,Gingers,Yeah!
2647,9,11,Eric Cartman,[resumes the march] Red Power!
2648,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2649,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
2650,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2651,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,I don't believe it.
2652,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
2653,9,11,Stan Marsh,Should we tell him the truth?
2654,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2655,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. [he and Stan return to their tetherball game]"
2656,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
2657,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2658,9,11,Eric Cartman,Better red than dead!
2659,9,11,Gingers,Better red than dead!
2660,9,11,Eric Cartman,Better red than dead!
2661,9,11,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of ""Annie"" has just premiered to cries of outrage. [a shot of gingers with Cartman front and center] A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie [shown, in character] is being played by a girl [shown in regular clothes and real hair] who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman."
2662,9,11,Eric Cartman,That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
2663,9,11,Field Reporter,What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?
2664,9,11,Eric Cartman,The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
2665,9,11,Gingers,Yeah! That's right! [among other things]
2666,9,11,Eric Cartman,"There she is! Get her! [the gingers rush her and start ganging up on her] Die, you stupid bitch!"
2667,9,11,Field Reporter,"This is getting pretty ugly, Tom. These gingers are really riled up! If you are a ginger and would like to join The Ginger Separatist Movement, you can attend their first meeting this Friday in the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton."
2668,9,11,Older Boy,"Okay, welcome, everyone. It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference! [everyone cheers] Now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman!"
2669,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[comes in pumped up like a televangelist to his own theme music] Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'? [the redhead cheer] Can I get a Red Power?"
2670,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
2671,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!"
2672,9,11,Gingers,Yeah!!
2673,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! [all the redheads cheer wildly]"
2674,9,11,Gary Nelson,Hello there! Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations. Just making sure you guys have everything you need. [long silence]
2675,9,11,Eric Cartman,"We're fine, thanks."
2676,9,11,Gary Nelson,Need any buffet items restocked? Everyone okay on coffee?
2677,9,11,Eric Cartman,We're fine!
2678,9,11,Gary Nelson,"Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference."
2679,9,11,Eric Cartman,"You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!! [Gary closes the door] My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!"
2680,9,11,Ginger 1,Huh
2681,9,11,Ginger 2,What
2682,9,11,Ginger 3,Ex-terminate?
2683,9,11,Eric Cartman,Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
2684,9,11,Gingers,Wirha! atta!
2685,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!"
2686,9,11,Stan Marsh,Huh? Why?
2687,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!"
2688,9,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)"
2689,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Are you in?
2690,9,11,Stan Marsh,... totally.
2691,9,11,Stan Marsh,"You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night."
2692,9,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Hehe, yeah, heh) [Stan stops and gasps. The other two stop. Before them stand at least five redheads]"
2693,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Oh... hey there. [long silence]
2694,9,11,Stan Marsh,You guys... need... anything? [long silence]
2695,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's just... let's just walk this way. [starts to cross the street, Stan and Kenny follow him, but they all see more gingers crawl out of the bushes across the street]"
2696,9,11,Stan Marsh,"More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home."
2697,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, good idea. [the boys go back the way the came. Gingers converge upon them, and they begin to run]"
2698,9,11,Stan Marsh,The hell do they want? [A redhead comes in from the right side and snatches Kenny away]
2699,9,11,Kenny McCormick,(AH!)
2700,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny!
2701,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Run, dude, run!!"
2702,9,11,Clyde Donovan,[gathers his covers around him] Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH! [his parents leave their room]
2703,9,11,Mom,"Clyde? What is it, honey? [they go to his room and open his door, and are horrified. Before them is his window, wiiide open, and his empty bed. The wind howls outside]"
2704,9,11,Boy,Aaah! [turns around] Ginger kids! Nooo! [a ginger girl grabs a hold of him]
2705,9,11,Ginger Girl,"Laaa la, laaa lala."
2706,9,11,Girl,What is it?
2707,9,11,Ginger Girl,laaa lala.
2708,9,11,Boy,It's a... little ginger girl.
2709,9,11,Ginger Girl,laaa la.
2710,9,11,Girl,Shut the door!
2711,9,11,Ginger Girl,"Laaa la, laaa lala, laaa la."
2712,9,11,Ginger Kids,AAAAAH! [they panic and run away. The boy runs into the banister and falls down. The girl trips over him]
2713,9,11,Boy,Ow!
2714,9,11,Ginger Girl,"[reaches the entrance] Laaa la, laaa lala."
2715,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"In there! Let's go! [he and Stan run into it and close the doors. They run to a long log and lift it up] Get this jamb on the door! [they throw the jamb into place. Redheads try to wrestle the roads open but can't budge it. A window nearby breaks open and gingers start to crawl in through it. More windows break open, then the walls and doors start falling apart as the gingers barge in. Another ginger looks in from the roof and drops down to join the others. They grab Stan and Kyle, who scream one last time]"
2716,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. Kyle, wake up."
2717,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[wakes up] Huh. Whaaa? [stands up] Where are we? [walks to the cage wall and looks out. The Sunset Room is dark and red from the glow of a lava cauldron. There are cages all over the place, even hanging from the ceiling. The ginger kids stand around the cauldron]"
2718,9,11,Stan Marsh,I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
2719,9,11,Eric Cartman,My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! [the gingers stomp and cheer]
2720,9,11,Stan Marsh,Cartman?
2721,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh Jesus, I should have known!"
2722,9,11,Eric Cartman,"What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! [more stomping and cheering]"
2723,9,11,Gary Nelson,"You guys got everything you need in here? Need more coffee, buffet items?"
2724,9,11,Eric Cartman,"No, we're fine! Thank you!"
2725,9,11,Gary Nelson,How about lava? You got enough lava?
2726,9,11,Eric Cartman,Yes! We're good!
2727,9,11,Gary Nelson,"Okay. Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys."
2728,9,11,Eric Cartman,"You're welcome, now leave us alone!! [Gary leaves and closes the door] Now! Let the extermination begin! [more stomping and cheering] We will start... with the daywalker!"
2729,9,11,Gingers,"Daywalker! [The cage door opens and Kyle, handcuffed, is hauled out by two redheads and escorted to Cartman] Throw him in!"
2730,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman! I need to tell you something!
2731,9,11,Eric Cartman,Go on then! Say your last words!
2732,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
2733,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Okay fine, let him speak! [the redheads let Kyle go, and Kyle falls on his face] Then we kill every non-ginger here! [Kyle gets up, walks over to Cartman, and whispers in his ear. Cartman's anger vanishes, then surprise appears] You... you what? [Kyle repeats himself. Cartman looks around a bit fearfully, then touches his face all over and grits his teeth]"
2734,9,11,Ginger Boy,"Come on, let's fulfill the plan! All non-gingers must die!"
2735,9,11,Gingers,Yeah!
2736,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[now hesitant] Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something. [backpedals] We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us. [throws away his staff] What have we become?"
2737,9,11,Gingers,Huh? What?
2738,9,11,Eric Cartman,"D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together."
2739,9,11,Ginger Boy 2,But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.
2740,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like."
2741,9,11,Ginger Boy 2,But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.
2742,9,11,Eric Cartman,"See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. [the gingers look at him, stunned]"
2743,9,11,Ginger Boy,"[long beat, then] What did that kid in the green hat tell you?"
2744,9,11,Eric Cartman,... Huh?
2745,9,11,Ginger Boy,That kid right there. What did he just tell you?
2746,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated."
2747,9,11,Ginger Boy,"You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. What did he tell you?"
2748,9,11,Eric Cartman,"No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together."
2749,9,11,Gingers,"[unsure] Ginger or not, it's all the same."
2750,9,11,Eric Cartman,That's it! You've got it!
2751,9,11,Cartman and the Gingers,"Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame. 
Hand in hand, we can live together."
2752,9,11,Eric Cartman,Live together!
2753,9,11,Gingers,We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
2754,9,11,Eric Cartman,"The same, you and I!"
2755,9,11,Gingers,"Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame."
2756,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman."
2757,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes, but I'm not going to die. [steps forth] That's why we gotta get along, people!"
2758,9,11,Gingers,"Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same."
2759,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer."
2760,9,12,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, I got a crappy AJ Feeley again!"
2761,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,"How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?"
2762,9,12,Stan Marsh,I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
2763,9,12,Eric Cartman,"HA! Saving money, duhhh! [turns left and walks. The others follow. Kenny moves the card in his left hand to his right hand]"
2764,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
2765,9,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex."
2766,9,12,Kenny McCormick,(Hey yeah!)
2767,9,12,Stan Marsh,"[stops] No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys. [the others stop and he catches up] Let's just do something fun that's free."
2768,9,12,Eric Cartman,"Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars."
2769,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah dude, nothing fun is free."
2770,9,12,Stan Marsh,Well I can't spend any money.
2771,9,12,Eric Cartman,"Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. [he, Kenny and Kyle walk off]"
2772,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. See ya. [Stan moves on down the sidewalk and passes a Scientology center. In front are a table with two people seated behind it, waiting for prospects]"
2773,9,12,Woman,"Hello, would you like to take a personality test? It's fun and it's free."
2774,9,12,Stan Marsh,"[stops, thinks, and looks] Excuse me?"
2775,9,12,Woman,We're doing free personality tests today.
2776,9,12,Stan Marsh,Uh what do I have to do?
2777,9,12,Woman,"Have you heard of Scientology? It's all based on the book, Dianetics. A lot of really cool people are Scientologists, like Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Why don't you come on in and we'll get your fun free personality test started. [leads him in and walks by one closed door after another] Let's just find an empty room here, lots of people getting free tests today. [finds an open door and looks in] Hey Brian."
2778,9,12,Brian,"[seated at his desk, rises and walks to the door] Hey Kelly. How's it going?"
2779,9,12,R. Kelly,"Great! I want you to meet my new friend, Stan."
2780,9,12,Brian,Hey there! How are you?
2781,9,12,Stan Marsh,Fine.
2782,9,12,R. Kelly,Brian's gonna give you your personality test and then let you know some things about Scientology.
2783,9,12,Brian,"Good times, good times!"
2784,9,12,Stan Marsh,"L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something."
2785,9,12,Brian,"Ho, that's not a problem at all. Scientology is more like an alternative to psychology than a religion."
2786,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Then how come that sign says ""Church of Scientology""?"
2787,9,12,Brian,"Oho, that's just this thing: What's the Denver Broncos' record now? Six and two?"
2788,9,12,Stan Marsh,Seven and two.
2789,9,12,Brian,"Wow! That's great! All right, come on in and take a seat; we're gonna have some fun! [he and Stam enter the room and he changes the sign on his door so it says ""Test In Progress."" Inside, Brian and Stan take their seats] All right now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions. Just answer these questions as truthfully as you can, alright? [picks up a notepad and starts noting Stan's answers] Okay. Number 1: Do you ever make remarks... which you later regret?"
2790,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Uhhh, sh-sure?"
2791,9,12,Brian,Uh huh. Would you rather give orders... than take them?
2792,9,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
2793,9,12,Brian,"Do you ever whistle... just for the fun of it. [The wall clock reads 11:35, then 12:20, and the camera pans down to Brian and Stan.] Okay, and finally, does life sometimes feel vague and confusing to you?"
2794,9,12,Stan Marsh,Yes.
2795,9,12,Brian,"Okay, Stan. Well, that's it. That's the end of the personality test."
2796,9,12,Stan Marsh,So how did I do?
2797,9,12,Brian,"Well, I hate to tell you this, Stan, but... you are one messed-up kid."
2798,9,12,Stan Marsh,...Huh??
2799,9,12,Brian,"Yeah, I'm afraid that you are completely miserable and totally depressed."
2800,9,12,Stan Marsh,I am?? I didn't know that!
2801,9,12,Brian,Well there's certainly no question that you are a perfect candidate for Scientology. I think it can really make you happy again.
2802,9,12,Stan Marsh,What what do I do?
2803,9,12,Brian,It's very simple. We just need two hundred and forty dollars.
2804,9,12,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, you haven't touched your food. What's the matter with you?"
2805,9,12,Stan Marsh,I'm totally depressed.
2806,9,12,Sharon Marsh,What? Why?
2807,9,12,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
2808,9,12,Sharon Marsh,Well how long have you been feeling this way?
2809,9,12,Stan Marsh,I'm not sure. But... I need two hundred and forty dollars.
2810,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!"
2811,9,12,Stan Marsh,"No, I found a self-help program that can cure me."
2812,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley."
2813,9,12,Stan Marsh,But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
2814,9,12,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, I didn't know you were miserable."
2815,9,12,Stan Marsh,Neither did I!
2816,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?"
2817,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Don't you care that I'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa??"
2818,9,12,Marvin Marsh,Huh?
2819,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!"
2820,9,12,Stan Marsh,[looking real sad] ...well but... but that's my money.
2821,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?"
2822,9,12,R. Kelly,"Michelle, our friend Stan wants to have auditing."
2823,9,12,Michelle,"Oho good, you're going to be so happy."
2824,9,12,Stan Marsh,I hope so.
2825,9,12,R. Kelly,"It's the beginning of a whole new life for you, Stan. See ya afterwards."
2826,9,12,Michelle,"Great, so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars. [Stan pulls out the bills and hands them over to Michelle] Perfect! We're on our way! [puts the money in a secure drawer and escorts Stan...] Come on over here and I'll fill you in on how the Church of Scientology works. [...down a hallway] You see, Stan, Scientology was founded by a great man named L. Ron Hubbard. [a portrait of him is shown] Mr. Hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called ""body thetans."""
2827,9,12,Stan Marsh,Really?
2828,9,12,Michelle,"Yes! And being the genius that he was, Mr. Hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans. [stops by a picture of a portable blue machine with two cylindrical grips plugged into the back] This is called an E-meter. It's the main tool of Scientology. You just grab a hold of these handles as I talk you through past experiences in your life. I'll be taking readings here, and we'll be able to determine your thetan levels."
2829,9,12,Stan Marsh,Thetan levels...
2830,9,12,Michelle,"Come on in the auditing room and I'll show you how it works. [moments later they are in the auditing room. They walk by a row of booths, each with a tester and a testee] All these people are just like you, Stan, auditing with E-meters to get rid of their negative emotions. [she reaches an empty booth and sits behind the controls as Stan takes his seat] All right, Stan, I want you to just relax and take hold of the E-meter handles. [Stan grabs them and draws them close]"
2831,9,12,Stan Marsh,"So, this is gonna make me happy?"
2832,9,12,Michelle,"Just take a few deep breaths, and I'll just get a base reading of your thetan levels. [Stan takes a deep breath and exhales, not quite sure why, then Michelle turns on the machine to take the reading. It reaches a 9.15] Huh, that's, that's strange."
2833,9,12,Stan Marsh,What?
2834,9,12,Michelle,"Somethin-, [soft giggle] something's wrong. Brian, could you come over here a second?"
2835,9,12,Brian,"[appears next to her] Yep- Oh hey there, Greg!"
2836,9,12,Stan Marsh,Stan.
2837,9,12,Michelle,Will you... look at his thetan levels?
2838,9,12,Brian,"Huh, well. We'll get another E-meter - this one's obviously broken. Sorry about this, Greg."
2839,9,12,Recruiter,"And so we just try to analyze your personality, and if it seems like you need some help, then you can have an audit counseling for a nominal fee."
2840,9,12,Mr Mackey,"Well, that sounds pretty reasonable, m'kay. [Brian comes out of the auditing room nervously]"
2841,9,12,Brian,"Mike, I need to talk to you!"
2842,9,12,Mike,"Excuse me, sir, I'll be right back. [he and Brian go into the hallway] Are you all right? You're sweating!"
2843,9,12,Brian,[shows him Stan's E-meter results] Take a look at this.
2844,9,12,Mike,[looks] What is it?
2845,9,12,Brian,The E-meter results from the little boy in Room D
2846,9,12,Mike,[leafing through the results] This... this can't be right. [scans faster]
2847,9,12,Brian,We ran the tests four times! We used four different E-meters!
2848,9,12,Mike,Fax these results to the head office in Los Angeles. The President has to see thus right away. Go! [slaps Brian across the back] Now! [Brian leaves]
2849,9,12,Woman,"The boy is from a small mountain town in Colorado, sir."
2850,9,12,Man,"Sir, how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level?? He registered OT9! I'm only OT7 and I've been in the church all my life!"
2851,9,12,Scientology President,I've waited... forty-two years... for this day.
2852,9,12,Man,Sir?
2853,9,12,Scientology President,Don't you all see what this means? There was only one person who EVER registered OT9 in the history of our church. [looks at something. The others gather to look with him. They look at a framed portrait of L. Ron Hubbard] L. Ron Hubbard said he had lived past lives. That when he died his thetan would show itself again. Our prophet has returned. [removes Stan's picture from the report and holds it up against the portrait.]
2854,9,12,Sharon Marsh,"Uh, Stanley, take the garbage out before you go to bed."
2855,9,12,Stan Marsh,I took out the garbage yesterday.
2856,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Right now, Stan!"
2857,9,12,Stan Marsh,Aagh! [hauls the garbage bag out of the garbage can and drags it across the living room] Stupid dumb garbage! [opens the front door and steps out.]
2858,9,12,Man 2,[offscreen] There he is! [Stan's anger changes to surprise]
2859,9,12,Man 3,Thank you for returning!
2860,9,12,Man 4,He's wonderful. [cries] He's wonderful.
2861,9,12,Randy Marsh,[the rest of the family joins Stan at the door] Stan! What the hell did you do?!
2862,9,12,Stan Marsh,"I don't know! [a Scientology helicopter lands on the lawn and some officials open the door for the church's president, who exits, walks over to Stan, and kneels down]"
2863,9,12,Scientology President,"Hello young man. I'm the head of Scientology. It is... [with great emotion, bows his head] a great honor to meet you!"
2864,9,12,Randy Marsh,"All right, what the hell is going on here?!"
2865,9,12,Scientology President,"We've been looking for your son for a long time, Mr. Marsh. He is the reincarnation of our church's most famous prophet."
2866,9,12,Sharon Marsh,Wwhat??
2867,9,12,Scientology President,Scientologists the world over are simply rejoicing at his second coming.
2868,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?"
2869,9,12,Scientology President,"We're not asking him to join us, we're asking him... to lead us."
2870,9,12,Shelly Marsh,"Oh my God, it's John Travolta! [Sharon and Randy go to investigate]"
2871,9,12,John Travolta,[using an odd voice as he makes his way through the crowd] Is this where he lives? Is this where L. Ron Hubbard is? Oh my god!
2872,9,12,Scientology President,"Yes, John Travolta and Tom Cruise are big Scientologists. Do you believe me nooow? [kneels next to Stan] Young man, I know you don't remember it,but... your name was L. Ron Hubbard. You revealed the secret that began the whole Church of Scientology."
2873,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. [Stan walks up the stairs, not sure what's going on]"
2874,9,12,Stan Marsh,[enters his room] Jesus Christ...
2875,9,12,Tom Cruise,"[suddenly appears in his room] L. Ron? [runs up and kneels before Stan] L. Ron! It really is you! [puts his hands over his heart] Oh, this is the greatest day of my life!"
2876,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Aw dude, I need to go to bed."
2877,9,12,Tom Cruise,"Don't you understand, L. Ron? It's me! Tom Cruise!"
2878,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I know who you are."
2879,9,12,Tom Cruise,"Ha-haven't I done well, L. Ron? Haven't you enjoyed my acting? Which film did you like best?"
2880,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess."
2881,9,12,Tom Cruise,...What?
2882,9,12,Stan Marsh,"I mean, you're not Gene Hackman or that guy who played Napoleon Dynamite, but you're okay."
2883,9,12,Tom Cruise,[buries his face in his hands] I'm nothing. [lifts his head again] I'm a failure in the eyes of the Prophet! AAAH! [runs into Stan's closet and closes the door]
2884,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey! [walks over to the closet] Dude, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it."
2885,9,12,Tom Cruise,Go away!
2886,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is my room!"
2887,9,12,Tom Cruise,"Go away, I said!"
2888,9,12,Stan Marsh,[walks out into the hall] Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
2889,9,12,Tom Cruise,What?!
2890,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. [Randy enters the room and tries to open the closet door, then knocks. Stan looks on]"
2891,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Cruise? Mr. Cruise, come out of the closet."
2892,9,12,Tom Cruise,No!
2893,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous."
2894,9,12,Tom Cruise,I'm never coming out!
2895,9,12,Randy Marsh,[to Stan] What did you say to him?
2896,9,12,Stan Marsh,I just told him I thought the Napoleon Dynamite guy is a better actor than he is.
2897,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh boy. [knocks on the door again] Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out."
2898,9,12,Sharon Marsh,What's going on?
2899,9,12,Randy Marsh,Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
2900,9,12,Sharon Marsh,What??
2901,9,12,Tom Cruise,Just leave me alone!
2902,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!"
2903,9,12,Field Reporter,"It's been four hours now, and Tom Cruise still will not come out of the closet. Hundreds of onlookers here have gathered here in hopes that the celebrity will finally give in."
2904,9,12,Sergeant,"Tom Cruise, this is Park County police! Please come out of the closet. [the house is shown] Everybody here just wants you to come out of the closet, Tom. [someone takes a picture. The house is shown again] Nobody's gonna be mad, everything's gonna be all right. Just come out of the closet."
2905,9,12,Field Reporter,"We're still not exactly sure why Tom Cruise is in the closet, but I'm being joined now by famous singer/songwriter R. Kelly."
2906,9,12,R Kelly,"Well I was just standing here, and Tom Cruise locked himself in the closetI asked myself why won't Tom Cruise just come out the closet?Nobody has no answers, and so I pull out my gun!"
2907,9,12,Scientology President,"Please, understand, we just want what is best for your son. The reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard must be taken care of. He had many enemies."
2908,9,12,Randy Marsh,Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?
2909,9,12,Scientology President,Yes. But he was also a prophet... who knew the secret truth about the nature of life.
2910,9,12,Sharon Marsh,This is just too much.
2911,9,12,Scientology President,"We want to reveal to Stan the great secret of life behind our church. The safely-guarded Scientology doctrine. Please, your son deserves to be enlightened."
2912,9,12,Randy Marsh,"Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?"
2913,9,12,Stan Marsh,Sure.
2914,9,12,Randy Marsh,"All right, go ahead and tell him."
2915,9,12,Scientology President,"Would you excuse us, please? This is highly-classified church information."
2916,9,12,Randy Marsh,Aw rats. [he and Sharon leave]
2917,9,12,Scientology President,"Usually, to hear the secret doctrine, you have to be in the church for several years, Stan. [leans in] Are you ready to hear the truth?"
2918,9,12,Stan Marsh,"I, I guess."
2919,9,12,Scientology President,"You see, Stan, there is a reason for people feeling sad and depressed. [leans in] An alien reason. It all began 75 million years ago. Back then there was a galactinc federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil Lord Xenu."
2920,9,12,Xenu,Ho ho ho ho ho ho.
2921,9,12,Scientology President,"Xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated, [Xenu gives his orders] and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets, [the roundup is shown] and then had those aliens frozen. [one by one, the aliens are frozen]"
2922,9,12,Xenu,[laughing over his plan] Wa ha ha ha!
2923,9,12,Scientology President,"The frozen alien bodies were loaded onto Xenu's galactic cruisers, which looked like DC-8s, except with rocket engines. The cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet, to Earth, and dumped them into the volcanoes of Hawaii. [a shot of the frozen aliens encased in ice being dropped from the orange cruisers] The aliens were no longer frozen, they were dead. The souls of those aliens, however, lived on, and all floated up towards the sky. But the evil Lord Xenu had prepared for this."
2924,9,12,Xenu,Wa ha ha ha!
2925,9,12,Scientology President,"Xenu didn't want their souls to return! And so he built giant soul-catchers in the sky! [the soul-catchers are shown] The souls were taken to a huge soul brain-washing facility, which Xenu had ALSO built on Earth. [the souls are watching a movie screen with 3D glasses] There the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material [Egyptian gods, Jesus carrying the Cross, and a bronze Buddha statue are shown] which tricked them into believing a false reality. Xenu then released the alien souls, which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion. At the dawn of man, the souls finally found bodies which they can grab onto. They attached themselves to all mankind, which still to this day causes all our fears, our confusions, and our problems. [Stan looks at the president, a bit awed] L. Ron Hubbard did an amazing thing telling the world this incredible truth. Now all we're asking you to do... [hands Stan a pen and some paper] is pick up where he left off."
2926,9,12,Stan Marsh,But I don't know any of this stuff.
2927,9,12,Scientology President,"Neither did L. Ron when he started. He said he just closed his eyes, and wrote down whatever came to mind. You can do the same. Just let it flow."
2928,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet."
2929,9,12,Scientology President,I know. We've sent Nicole Kidman up there to see if she can help.
2930,9,12,Nicole Kidman,"[knocks on the closet door] Tom? Tom, It's Nicole."
2931,9,12,Tom Cruise,Ah hi Nicole.
2932,9,12,Nicole Kidman,"Tom, don't you think this has gone on long enough? It's time for you to come out of the closet."
2933,9,12,Tom Cruise,"...I'm not, I'm not in the closet."
2934,9,12,Nicole Kidman,"Yes you are, Tom. And you need to just end this and come out. [silence] I'm not gonna think any differently of you. Katie's not gonna think any differently of you. You don't need to be in that closet anymore, Tom."
2935,9,12,Tom Cruise,"I'm not in here, though."
2936,9,12,Nicole Kidman,"Yes, you are."
2937,9,12,Tom Cruise,"I'm not, ...I'm not in the closet."
2938,9,12,Nicole Kidman,"Then how am I talking to you, Tom? [silence] Tom, you can't hide forever just because the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard doesn't like your acting. Come out of the closet, Tom. You're not fooling anyone."
2939,9,12,Tom Cruise,"I'm, I'm not, I'm not in here."
2940,9,12,Stan Marsh,"[gets an idea] Yeah, yeah!"
2941,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies."
2942,9,12,Stan Marsh,I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
2943,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into."
2944,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact."
2945,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times."
2946,9,12,Stan Marsh,I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
2947,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,What secret truth??
2948,9,12,Stan Marsh,"I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!"
2949,9,12,Kyle Broflovski,I didn't know you were depressed.
2950,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! [Kyle and Kenny leave]"
2951,9,12,Eric Cartman,"Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. [leaves]"
2952,9,12,John Travolta,"Tom! Hey Tom, this is John Travolta."
2953,9,12,Tom Cruise,Oh hey John.
2954,9,12,John Travolta,"Tom, you've gotta come out of the closet. Oh my God."
2955,9,12,Tom Cruise,L. Ron Hubbard doesn't think I'm a great actor.
2956,9,12,John Travolta,"Mm-maybe you took what he said out of context. Okay, 's like, if you don't come out, can I at least come in and talk to you?"
2957,9,12,Tom Cruise,"Oh... Okay, but no tricks."
2958,9,12,John Travolta,"No tricks. [gives the group standing out in the hall a thumbs-up. The door opens and John goes into the closet.] Hey, it's really nice n here."
2959,9,12,Tom Cruise,"Yeah, see?"
2960,9,12,John Travolta,I feel really safe. Oh my god.
2961,9,12,Randy Marsh,"[knocks] Hello? [tries to force the door open] Hey, come out of there!"
2962,9,12,Field Reporter,"Tom, it now appears that John Travolta is also in the closet, and he refuses to come out. Here with more details once again, is R. Kelly."
2963,9,12,R Kelly,"I was just standing here. Tom Cruise locked himself in the closetThen John Travolta come and now, John Travolta in the closet too.Please Tom Cruise and John Travolta come out the closet!But then I calm myself down, and I pull out my gun!"
2964,9,12,Field Reporter,"Oh geez, here we go with the gun again."
2965,9,12,R Kelly,
2966,9,12,Scientology President,"Yes... Yes, oh this is great, Stan!"
2967,9,12,Stan Marsh,"I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers."
2968,9,12,Scientology President,"Yes, of course! So wonderful!"
2969,9,12,Stan Marsh,And I wrote that the evil Lord Xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail.
2970,9,12,Scientology President,"Yes, of course!"
2971,9,12,Stan Marsh,"And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologists should no longer have to pay money to belong."
2972,9,12,Scientology President,[his joy disappears] What?
2973,9,12,Stan Marsh,"I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help."
2974,9,12,Scientology President,"[turns around] What are you, stupid?! Then how do we make money from those people?!"
2975,9,12,Stan Marsh,"... Well, it's not about the money, it's about the message, right?"
2976,9,12,Scientology President,"Wait a minute, whoa, whoa! You don't actually believe this crap, do you?? Dummy! Brainwashed alien souls?? E-meters and thetan levels?? Those people out there buy that crap and I thought YOU were smart enough to see what was really going on!"
2977,9,12,Stan Marsh,But you said that there were-
2978,9,12,Scientology President,"What's better than telling people a stupid story and having them believe you?! [Stan draws a blank] Having them PAY you for it, stupid!"
2979,9,12,Stan Marsh,"But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?"
2980,9,12,Scientology President,"Because if those people all think you're the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, then they'll all buy your new writings, and you and I together will make three million dollars!"
2981,9,12,Stan Marsh,Three million dollars?
2982,9,12,Scientology President,That's how the scam works! But this is a scam on a global scale! Do you fucking get me now?! [leans in a bit]
2983,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Yeah, I get you."
2984,9,12,Scientology President,"Then keep writing, L. Ron! Your people are waiting."
2985,9,12,Field Reporter,Breaking news here in South Park. Tom Cruise and John Travolta still... will not come out of the closet. Park County police have decided to try a new method.
2986,9,12,R Kelly,"I've been asked to come up here, get you both out of the closetMan, this is some crazy shit. Why won't you both just come out the closet?And they said..."
2987,9,12,Tom Cruise,"We're not comin' out the closet, so you can just go away."
2988,9,12,John Travolta,"We're not comin' out the closet, so you can just go away."
2989,9,12,R Kelly,But everyone wants you out the closet.
2990,9,12,Tom Cruise,That doesn't matter 'cause we're gonna stay.
2991,9,12,John Travolta,That doesn't matter 'cause we're gonna stay.
2992,9,12,R Kelly,"Now I'm startin' to get angry, so I pull out my gun!"
2993,9,12,Scientology President,"My fellow Scientologists! Our prophet has finished his new doctrine, and will now read some passages before making it available to you all for a nominal fee. [the crowd cheers] I give you... the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard! [two officials bow and then spread roses before Stan's feet as he walks down a red carpet towards a marble stand with ""SCIENTOLOGY"" engraved along the front. Stan is dressed in toga and laurel. The crowd cheers wildly]"
2994,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon."
2995,9,12,Crowd,Ohhhh.
2996,9,12,Man,Nubanon.
2997,9,12,Stan Marsh,"And uh, oh, [hopeful faces look back at him] ...I ...I can't do this."
2998,9,12,Scientology President,"Huh, what?"
2999,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything."
3000,9,12,Man 2,Huh?
3001,9,12,Woman,What?
3002,9,12,Stan Marsh,[takes off his laurel] I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
3003,9,12,Brian,Oh! We are gonna sue you!
3004,9,12,Stan Marsh,What??
3005,9,12,Scientology President,"Yeah, you think you can say our religion is a lie?! We'll sue you, buddy!"
3006,9,12,Stan Marsh,YOU told me it was a lie!
3007,9,12,Scientology President,"Ho, now you're puttin' words in MY mouth! You are so sued!"
3008,9,12,Man 3,"You can't make fun of Scientology, kid! We are gonna sue your ass AND your balls!"
3009,9,12,Crowd,"Yeah, that's right!"
3010,9,12,Scientology President,"How dare you mock our faith, you little punk?! You'll be hearing from our lawyers tomorrow!"
3011,9,12,Field Reporter,"We've just had an incredible development here, Mitch. Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly, have all come out of the closet! [The three of them come out the front door and Cruise releases R. Kelly, who moves off and out of view.]"
3012,9,12,Tom Cruise,"[approaches Stan] So you're NOT the prophet, huh?! You made me look stupid! I'm gonna sue you too!"
3013,9,12,Stan Marsh,Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!
3014,9,12,Tom Cruise,I will! I'll sue you in England!
3015,9,12,Scientology President,"You are so sued, kid!"
3016,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Well go on, then! Sue me!"
3017,9,12,Scientology President,We're going to!
3018,9,12,Stan Marsh,"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!"
3019,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"And now, Jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave! [the whale rolls to the right and smacks one of its fins on the water, which splashes onto the audience. The crowd ooos and ahhs. A wave of water hits the boys, who are sitting in the front row.]"
3020,9,13,Eric Cartman,I'm all wet! Sweet!
3021,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, Jambu is the best! [Jambu returns and takes a quick dive towards the bottom of its tank.]"
3022,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Now get ready for Jambu's next trick. [Jambu leaps up into the air, performs a somersault, and strikes the water with its fluke, again sending water onto the boys]"
3023,9,13,Eric Cartman,Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
3024,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[shown as a brunet, with long sideburns] How about that, folks! A full body flip! And now, Kelly's gonna show us how she makes Jambu do his tricks. [a blonde woman in a wet suit steps forward, kneels down by the edge of the small dock she's on, and strikes the water three times with her hand] When Kelly slaps her hand three times, Jambu comes to her. Jambu will stay and wait until Kelly gives him a command. [she signals for him to go forward, and she dives in after him] Oh, what trick are we gonna see? Get those cameras ready! [Kelly dives and gets into position. Jambu circles the tank, then returns and pops up out of the water with Kelly on his nose. She then waves her arms signaling she's fine.] That's Kelly riding on Jambu's nose! [aside, to his partner Mike in the booth] I wish Kelly would ride on my nose. [they both laugh. Jambu drops a bit and Kelly dives off his nose. Jambu splashes the crown once more.]"
3025,9,13,Eric Cartman,Yes! Yeehehehes! [Jambu returns with Kelly on his nose as if she were a hood ornament]
3026,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show, and enjoy the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park! [clicks off his mic] You bunch of retards. [Mike laughs. Everyone begins to clear the small stadium]"
3027,9,13,Stan Marsh,"[reading the park map] Okay, where to next?"
3028,9,13,Eric Cartman,I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
3029,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
3030,9,13,Eric Cartman,Why?
3031,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him."
3032,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?"
3033,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show."
3034,9,13,Eric Cartman,Killer. [the boys turn and leave]
3035,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
3036,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. [turns to catch up with Stan and Kenny. Kyle walks around the tank]"
3037,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Jambu? Jambu? [taps the glass wall four times. Jambu dives and floats up facing Kyle] Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu."
3038,9,13,Jambu,"Hello, little boy. [Stan is awed that the whale could talk] You like my flippers?"
3039,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[a little scared, looks around] Who said that?"
3040,9,13,Jambu,I did.
3041,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,No way!
3042,9,13,Jambu,"This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from?"
3043,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,[timidly] South Park.
3044,9,13,Jambu,It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please?
3045,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,What do you wanna talk about?
3046,9,13,Jambu,Let's talk about rocket ships.
3047,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Rocket ships?
3048,9,13,Jambu,"[it's actually Brian, still in his booth] Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank. [he and Mike both laugh, then he shushes Mike and returns to the mic]. You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship."
3049,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Why? Aren't you happy here?
3050,9,13,Jambu,"I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!"
3051,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! [the two men in the booth are laughing their asses off]
3052,9,13,Jambu,"Oh God, it's funny every single time. [Mike continues laughing]"
3053,9,13,Stingray Announcer,"And for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. Stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. We invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by."
3054,9,13,Eric Cartman,"[slapping the water as a stingray approaches] Heh! Come on, stingray! [it speeds away. Another one approaches] Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me! [it speeds away as well] Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!"
3055,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,[running up to the other boys] Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
3056,9,13,Stan Marsh,What?
3057,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!"
3058,9,13,Kenny McCormick,(What the fuck are you talking about?)
3059,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! [runs back towards Jambu's exhibit, grinning]"
3060,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Jambu! Jambu, I'm back! [hits the wall four times, and Jambu swims around, stopping in front of Kyle again] How are you feeling? [no reply. A few seconds later...] Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships? [Brian is playing a video game, Mike is reading a book - Mother Trucker.] Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?"
3061,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man."
3062,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!"
3063,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[noticing the commotion] Dude, he's back, he's back! [the two men get ready]"
3064,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddammit, say something!"
3065,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale."
3066,9,13,Jambu,[Cartman stops in his tracks] Please don't call me stupid.
3067,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?"
3068,9,13,Jambu,"I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see."
3069,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Sick?
3070,9,13,Stan Marsh,I don't believe it.
3071,9,13,Jambu,"Yes, because I'm not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I'm from the moon! [Brian clicks off his mic, Mike laughs, and they both crack up]"
3072,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,The moon?
3073,9,13,Jambu,"The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die."
3074,9,13,Eric Cartman,You live on the moon?
3075,9,13,Jambu,I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.
3076,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God...
3077,9,13,Stan Marsh,Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
3078,9,13,Jambu,"I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform."
3079,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,That's terrible!
3080,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Dude, dude, the boss is coming!"
3081,9,13,Jambu,"Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick. [coughs] Can't. Talk. Any. More. [coughs. The boys stand there, stunned]"
3082,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,"
3083,9,13,Butters Stotch,Well okay! Let's do it!
3084,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work."
3085,9,13,Clyde Donovan,...A whale. Talked to you.
3086,9,13,Stan Marsh,It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
3087,9,13,Craig Tucker,"Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking."
3088,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?"
3089,9,13,Craig Tucker,Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.
3090,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
3091,9,13,Craig Tucker,...So it's true.
3092,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?"
3093,9,13,Token Black,...What do we do?
3094,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Stan? [Stan rises and approaches the easel]
3095,9,13,Stan Marsh,"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards."
3096,9,13,Timmy Burch,"[softly] Timmihhhhh... [The guard looks back just after they pass by, so he just missed them. The boys reach Jambu's tank]"
3097,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Craig, Token, get the slings ready. [Cartman, Clyde, and a third boy position a ladder into place. Jambu swims over to see what's happening.]"
3098,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here."
3099,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Dude, did you see that episode of Trading Spouses last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell? [people mill around by Jambu's tank. Police officers move about. The park's owner talks to the guard]"
3100,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,"How could you not have seen anything?? It's a whale, for Christ's sake!"
3101,9,13,Security Guard,It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.
3102,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,Were you in there for three hours?!
3103,9,13,Security Guard,"[hurt, turns away and shields himself] Don't yell at me! [Brianand Mike arrive from the booth]"
3104,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,What happened?
3105,9,13,Orca Trainer Kelly,"Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park."
3106,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,What? How?
3107,9,13,Security Guard,[raises his head up long enough to say] I DON'T KNOW!
3108,9,13,Sergeant,"All right, people, it's obvious we're dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group. Those bastards have done stuff like this before."
3109,9,13,Nelson,"Sir! Sir, we've found a note!"
3110,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,A note? Let me see that. [reads the note] We're taking Willzy-x home to the moon. Long live the zypods! [the duo instantly realize who stole Jambu] What the hell does that mean?
3111,9,13,Sergeant,"Harris, run a fingerprint on that note! [hands the note to Harris] Nelson! Find out what kind of crayon it was written with. [Nelson leaves] We'll find out who was responsible for this! [the duo know the jig is up]"
3112,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,We have to tell them! We know what those boys look like!
3113,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all our fault"
3114,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,It IS all our fault!
3115,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!
3116,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"I shouldn't have laughed. All those times we've messed with those kids' heads, I shouldn't have just sat there and laughed."
3117,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,[grabs him by the arms] Don't you say that! It was funny! It was really funny! We've just... [lets him go] we've just gotta make this right ourselves.
3118,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,How?
3119,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do!
3120,9,13,Putin,"Comrades, I'm afraid our situation is dire. The economy is stale and I... Very soon, Mother Russia... will no longer be a country."
3121,9,13,Aide,"Sir! Sir, somebody is on telephone! Another rich American wants to fly into space! [silence, then everyone rushes into Putin's office]"
3122,9,13,Putin,"Hello? Hello, this is Russian President."
3123,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money."
3124,9,13,Putin,"Yes, we certainly do! [holds his left thumb up for the others to see] What were you looking for?"
3125,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away."
3126,9,13,Putin,"The moon. That is quite large trip, but I'm sure we can do it!"
3127,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,You can? Awesome!
3128,9,13,Putin,"It sounds like we're in business! We will just need, say, twenty million dollars?"
3129,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,[lowers the phone with some disbelief] Twenty... million? [raises the phone to his ear again] Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
3130,9,13,Putin,...What?
3131,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
3132,9,13,Putin,"Goddamnit it is prank call again! [his staff leaves] Kiss my ass, George Bush! This is not funny! [slams the phone onto the base]"
3133,9,13,Stan Marsh,What happened?
3134,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,They want twenty million dollars.
3135,9,13,Eric Cartman,Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
3136,9,13,Craig Tucker,That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?
3137,9,13,Stan Marsh,They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
3138,9,13,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!"
3139,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all."
3140,9,13,Clyde Donovan,"Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!"
3141,9,13,News Anchor Tom and Field Reporter Chris,"A beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the Denver Sea Park. A full investigation is underway, but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one WHALE of a problem."
3142,9,13,News Anchor Tom and Field Reporter Chris,"Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale. [a crowd of protesters begin to chant]"
3143,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"That's right. We are members of the Animal Liberation Front! Whales do not belong in tanks, they belong in the ocean! We applaud whoever did this noble deed! Set the whales free!"
3144,9,13,Protesters,Set the whales free!
3145,9,13,News Anchor Tom and Field Reporter Chris,One thing for certain: something is certainly FISHY here at the Sea Park. Tom?
3146,9,13,News Anchor Tom and Field Reporter Chris,"Thank, Mitch. It seems that this problem is almost un-BEAR-able. [no one says a word] Let's hope that whale is found."
3147,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"This is so bad, man. How do we even know this is the right town to look in??"
3148,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did?
3149,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,[holds up a sheet of paper] Yeah.
3150,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Let's go! [they exit the truck and face the houses on one side of the street]
3151,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Maybe you should start with the houses on the left, a-and I'll take the-"
3152,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[stops him] Wait a minute. Check that out! [before them is a big pool in a backyard. The fence, which normally blocks off the view from the street, is destroyed, and tracks go through the gap all the way to the pool] Come on! [they move towards the pool and walk up the steps. Brian grabs some crap floating on the surface and shows it to Mike] Oh my good, look!"
3153,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Whale poo.
3154,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,We're close. We're really close!
3155,9,13,Mrs Donovan,[the sliding door opens] Can I help you?
3156,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,[drops the poo quickly and turns to face her] Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool.
3157,9,13,Mrs Donovan,Oh.
3158,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Have you noticed any whales in your pool at all?
3159,9,13,Mrs Donovan,"No, I don't believe so. But we've been out of town for a couple of days and came back to find the fence broken. Do you think somebody's been using it?"
3160,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys? [Mike hands her the sketch. She takes it and studies it]"
3161,9,13,Mrs Donovan,"The fat one in the middle... kinda looks like Dakota Fanning. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to get back to the oven. [hands the sketch back to the Mike]"
3162,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[turns around, getting exasperated] We're too late. They've moved on to another town!"
3163,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,We don't know that!
3164,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"If they've moved on, then we have no leads! This is fate, Brian! It's fate! For telling the kids their naked dads were gonna beat them up! For thinking that screwing with kids was funny!"
3165,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[grabs his Mike and shakes him] It WAS funny!! It was funny, Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny!"
3166,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"[knocks three times] Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?"
3167,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project."
3168,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. [Gerald goes down the stairs with Ike as she speaks, then she turns away and goes down the stairs]"
3169,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay ma, thanks! [behind him is Jambu, and the other boys are keeping him moist]"
3170,9,13,Butters Stotch,Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
3171,9,13,Clyde Donovan,"Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass."
3172,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to keep him wet."
3173,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program? [waits for the answer] How much to take a whale into space? [waits for the answer] Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on. [puts Mr. Sugiyama on hold as he answers another call] Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?"
3174,9,13,Jimmy Valmer,[with Timmy and Tweek] The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
3175,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
3176,9,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves."
3177,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Damnit! [hangs up without returning to Mr. Sugiyama] Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??"
3178,9,13,Eric Cartman,He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
3179,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah... He must be really sick. [walks up to the whale and strokes him] Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
3180,9,13,Clyde Donovan,Mexico has a space program?
3181,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?"
3182,9,13,Man,Allб
3183,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Thanks. [they leave and arrive at MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración] Is this the Mexican space program? [again, neglected beauty, and the place looks quite primitive for a space administration, straight out of the 1950s.]"
3184,9,13,Man 2,"Space, sн. Fly."
3185,9,13,Stan Marsh,Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
3186,9,13,Man 2,"Follow, sí, show yo. [sets down the part he was cleaning and goes inside the complex. The boys follow him] The roque lunar?"
3187,9,13,Stan Marsh,This rocket will fly to the moon?
3188,9,13,Man 2,"Sí, fly."
3189,9,13,Stan Marsh,To the moon?
3190,9,13,Man 2,Sí.
3191,9,13,Stan Marsh,[enunciates] We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
3192,9,13,Man 2,O-ah... Two hundred.
3193,9,13,Stan Marsh,Two hundred? Million?
3194,9,13,Man 2,Two hundred... dollars.
3195,9,13,Stan Marsh,"[to Craig] Quick, call Kyle."
3196,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son? [Sheila takes the composite sketch and looks at Kyle's image]"
3197,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though."
3198,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent!"
3199,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico."
3200,9,13,Both men,Mexico??
3201,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring."
3202,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Oh my God.
3203,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Which highway did they take??
3204,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch."
3205,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy."
3206,9,13,Eric Cartman,We have to hurry!
3207,9,13,Driver,I'm going as fast as I can.
3208,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!."
3209,9,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh hamburgers! What is that?? [The Denver Sea Park truck appears before them and blocks their way, so the driver stops. Brian steps out of the Sea Park truck. Mike joins him and they both stand before the Moovit truck until it stops, then they move to the driver's side door]"
3210,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"All right, out of the truck!"
3211,9,13,Eric Cartman,Uh oh.
3212,9,13,Driver,What the hell is goin' on?!
3213,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,You're carrying a stolen whale!
3214,9,13,Driver,Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!
3215,9,13,Clyde Donovan,We're busted. [Brian and Mike roll up the trailer and Kyle looks]
3216,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
3217,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Come on out, kid. [the four other boys walk around Brian and stop]"
3218,9,13,Driver,"Look, I didn't know nothin' about this."
3219,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.
3220,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!"
3221,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Look, kid, we need to tell you a little secret. [a bright light comes on and a police siren sounds. They all turn to see who it is. Two motorcycle cops get off their bikes.]"
3222,9,13,Cop 1,What's goin' on here??
3223,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Aw crap.
3224,9,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh, now we're gonna get it."
3225,9,13,Cop 1,Hey... That's the stolen whale!
3226,9,13,Cop 2,Everyone down on the ground. Now!
3227,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No! Please, we have to go!"
3228,9,13,Cop 2,You're not goin' anywhere! You're in a lot of trouble! [the first cop starts making arrests]
3229,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried."
3230,9,13,Cop 1,"We said down on the ground, kid. Move it! [three gunshots come out of nowhere, and everyone turns to see whom it could be now.]"
3231,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Leave those kids alone, you bastards! Animal Liberation Front! [the ALF members growl]"
3232,9,13,Cop 1,"Put down that weapon, now!"
3233,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,These boys are trying to get that whale home! You're not gonna stop them!
3234,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,All right!!
3235,9,13,The Other Boys,Yes! Wow!
3236,9,13,Cop 2,That whale belongs to a sea park!
3237,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,It belongs with its family!
3238,9,13,ALF Member,That's right!
3239,9,13,Cop 1,I said drop the gun NOW!
3240,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,Save the whale! [fires her gun and charges. The other ALF members charge and fire as well. Cop 2 is hit and falls. Cop 1 fires back. The boys hide behind the Moovit! truck]
3241,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Jesus, Oh God! [he's soon riddled with bullet holes and falls over]"
3242,9,13,ALF Member,"Save the whales, motherfucker!"
3243,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,[fires a few more rounds over the boys' heads as she positions herself behind them] Where are you taking the whale?
3244,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Tijuana, Mexico!"
3245,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Of course. Brilliant! Release it in international waters. I'll drive the truck. [she and the boys get into the cab, Kyle stays in the trailer with the whale]"
3246,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You're going home, Willzy-x! [the truck drives away, and Brian crawls over to Mike]"
3247,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Mike? Mike??
3248,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,[still has enough life in him to cough and say] It... wasn't... funny...
3249,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time. [Mike's head drops] All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!"
3250,9,13,Cop 1,[crawls to his bike and grabs a radio] Forty-five to dispatch... Stolen whale... heading to Tijuana... Whaaale to Tijuana!! [falls]
3251,9,13,Worker 1,"Conecte la segunda cadena. [""Connect the second chain.""]"
3252,9,13,Worker 2,"No sé si va a llegar. [""I don't know if it'll reach.""]"
3253,9,13,Stan Marsh,"They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?"
3254,9,13,Manuel and other members of the Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración (MASA),"Sн, fly."
3255,9,13,Butters Stotch,Look! The Mexican border!
3256,9,13,Clyde Donovan,"Oh Jesus, they're here! [the Denver cops are right there with the border guard]"
3257,9,13,Sergeant,"Hold your positions! [a police helicopter comes down. The owner of the sea park and the orca trainers step down from it, along with the security guard]"
3258,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,Aha! We've got them!
3259,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Hang on, boys."
3260,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,Mary Mother of God! [the Moovit! truck barrels through the helicopter and blockade. Everyone in the way jumps out of the way. The Moovit! truck is now in Mexico]
3261,9,13,Sergeant,"[lying face down, points at the truck] Get them!"
3262,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Willzy-x, I think we're here."
3263,9,13,Stan Marsh,[to the ALF leader] Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
3264,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"You got it, kid! [makes a quick right, then backs up left and towards the end of the dock]"
3265,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,[arriving at MASA with the guard and trainers] Don't let them get that whale in the water! [Kyle rolls open the trailer door]
3266,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it's all set to go! [the ALF van rolls in] Just get Willzy-x into the water! [some ALF officers emerge from the van.]"
3267,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, guys! [Craig, Clyde, Kenny, Butters, and Cartman show up. Clyde and Kenny jump up and pull the ramp down]"
3268,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,[starts to run in with the guard and trainers] Stop right now!
3269,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them! [The zoo personnel and the ALF face off, with the ALF landing the first blows. Kelly goes down like a statue. At the dock, the boys struggle to move Willzy-x into the water]"
3270,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang on. [looks around] Hold on a second. [steps down into the water and addresses Willzy-x] I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x. [the whale opens his mouth. Kyle begins to tear up] I'm gonna miss you. [Butters and Clyde tear up and look at each other] Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. [sniffs a bit, then pets the whale.]"
3271,9,13,Eric Cartman,Oh crap! There's more of them! [police cruisers pour in and officers pour out of them]
3272,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Get him in the water! [the boys pull Willzy-x once more, with a mighty pull] Goodbye, Willzy-x! [the whale takes to the water and the ALF cheers a job well done]"
3273,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Swim, mighty whale! You're free!"
3274,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Okay, Manuel, hit it. [Manuel presses the launch button]"
3275,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,[advances with the guard and police] Stop! That is my whale!
3276,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,I'm afraid you're too late! The whale's been set free.
3277,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,No!
3278,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Now you see that your ways of captivity and exploiting animals will never prevail. [behind her, a rocket rises into launch position] Not as long as there are children like these who still believe in the beauty and magic of freedom. [The park owner, guard, police, and now FBI gawk at her, or at the rocket behind her.] For it is children, with their innocence and their spirit, who know what is truly best for all the world."
3279,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,Oh my God!
3280,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,We did it!
3281,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Thanks for the ride, Manuel."
3282,9,13,Manuel and other members of the Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración (MASA),"Sн, bye. [closes the door and drives off]"
3283,9,13,Butters Stotch,"Well, see ya, fellas. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up."
3284,9,13,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah, me too. [Craig goes off as well]"
3285,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"All right. Thanks for your help, dudes. [the boys walk towards Kyle's house, but Kyle stops] Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing."
3286,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. [Stan looks at the sky and steps forward. The other boys join him. Before them, up in the sky, is the full moon, bright and nicely detailed]"
3287,9,13,Stan Marsh,I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
3288,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle."
3289,9,14,Class,Ichi!

3301,9,14,Karate Instructor,Karutamane-san! What are you doing?!
3302,9,14,Eric Cartman,I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves. [an aside] I'm a little better than everyone else here.
3303,9,14,Karate Instructor,"Eriku-san, you must follow direction! You raku disciprine!"
3304,9,14,Eric Cartman,"Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!"
3305,9,14,Karate Instructor,"Mina-san! You all needu more disciprine! [softens his tone] True disciprine... come from within. We are out of time. I will see you on Tuesday. [he dismisses the class in Japanese, they answer back]"
3306,9,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Stan] Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. [Cartman and Ike join them. Cartman is wearing a WWII-era Japanese flag as a head band]"
3307,9,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, let's go."
3308,9,14,Stan Marsh,[looks around] Wait. Where's my Dad?
3309,9,14,Kyle Broflovski,"He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?"
3310,9,14,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
3311,9,14,Stan Marsh,Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
3312,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[waddles in from Stan's right drunk, carrying two bottles of beer] Oh hey, sorry boys."
3313,9,14,Male Voice,Later Randy.
3314,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[turns to look at the source] Hey, see you Nelson."
3315,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, weren't you watching?"
3316,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. [waddles onto a parking space on his way to the driver door]"
3317,9,14,Kyle Broflovski,Are you sure you're all right?
3318,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going."
3319,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, aren't you supposed to like, not drink and drive?"
3320,9,14,Randy Marsh,"I'm not drinking and driving, I'm driving while I'm drinking. Right, boys?"
3321,9,14,Eric Cartman,"Sure, whatever dude."
3322,9,14,Randy Marsh,"...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan."
3323,9,14,Stan Marsh,Why not just pull over?
3324,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle! [Stan picks up a bottle and hands it to him] There's a [Zip. Stan's jaw drops] reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan. [Stan reaches over and holds it in place] When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! [swerves to avoid what turns out to be a police car]"
3325,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, we're gonna crash!"
3326,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Shh! Trying to concentrate! [the cruiser revs up, its lights turn on, and it begins to follow the car. Kyle looks to see what the cop will do] Just hold the damn wheel! [the sound of urine pouring into an empty bottle is heard]"
3327,9,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I think you're being followed. [turns around. Cartman then turns around to look]"
3328,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah? [instinctively displays his middle finger] Get off my ass, dickhole!"
3329,9,14,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] No, dude, it's the police. [the sirens are heard]"
3330,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Aww crap! [pulls over. The cruiser does as well] Here, hold this! [gives Stan the warm bottle of urine, looks around, and zips up his fly.]"
3331,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Aww, it's all warm!"
3332,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. [sticks some gum into his mouth and starts chewing. The cop taps on his window. Randy lowers the window.]"
3333,9,14,Officer,"License and registration, please."
3334,9,14,Randy Marsh,"What seems to be the officer, problem?"
3335,9,14,Officer,"[studies the situation, then] ...Sir, why don't you step out of the car for me?"
3336,9,14,Randy Marsh,Okay. [steps out of the car and straggles a few steps]
3337,9,14,Officer,"Sir, I'm going to give you a sobriety test."
3338,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Okay, no problem. Easy."
3339,9,14,Officer,"Stand over here, please? [moves him a few steps] Right there. All right, now I want you to hold your arms out at your sides... [Randy stands there for a moment, then raises his arms out]"
3340,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!"
3341,9,14,Officer,And now touch your finger to your nose.
3342,9,14,Randy Marsh,Do what??
3343,9,14,Officer,Touch your finger to your nose.
3344,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Wull come on, that's impossible!"
3345,9,14,Officer,"Just bring one hand to your nose, like this. [demonstrates.]"
3346,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay... [begins to make the attempt and wobbles] Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on. [turns around and his pants begin falling around his legs] Wa-hang on, hang on. [Cartman and Kyle are watching, Stan can't bear to look]"
3347,9,14,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what the hell is he doing?"
3348,9,14,Kyle Broflovski,I think his pants are falling down.
3349,9,14,Randy Marsh,What? What did I do?! [the officer closes the door] What did I do?!
3350,9,14,Officer 2,Keep blowing. Keep blowing.  Keep blowing. [Randy vomits onto the floor all of a sudden] Aw Jesus!
3351,9,14,Stan Marsh,[still not looking] This is sooo embarrassing.
3352,9,14,Eric Cartman,"You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!"
3353,9,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30."
3354,9,14,Eric Cartman,"Man, that was such a bummer."
3355,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?"
3356,9,14,Eric Cartman,Why?
3357,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?"
3358,9,14,Eric Cartman,"All right, Stan. Sure. [the school bell rings and Mrs. Garrison enters with her books, setting them on her desk]"
3359,9,14,Mrs Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. [the kids take their seats] Today we will be continuing our study of economics. But first, we're going to hear from a motivational speaker. The state has sent over somebody to talk to you all about the dangers of drunk driving. Please welcome Stan's dad. [a sober Randy walks in slowly and looks down]"
3360,9,14,Stan Marsh,Oh Jesus. [puts his hands over his eyes. Mrs. Garrison sits at her chair]
3361,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these."
3362,9,14,Mrs Garrison,"Oh that's very interesting, isn't it, kids? [the kids stay silent, Stan buries his face in his desk]"
3363,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess."
3364,9,14,Mrs Garrison,"...Well, I think we've all learned an important lesson, haven't we, class? If you don't make the right choices in life, you could end up being a big loser like Stan's dad. [the kids stay silent, Stan keeps his face buried] Drinking and driving is for idiots. Nobody wants to end up like Stan's dad, do they? [another shot of the class] I want you all to take a good look at Stan's dad and say, ""Is that who I want to be in thirty years? Getting tickets and having to go to elementary school classrooms and talk about how pathetic I am?"" Thank you Mr. Marsh, I think you made your point. [Randy turns away and walks out of the class]"
3365,9,14,AA Speaker,"Hello again everyone, my name is Michael, and, I'm an alcoholic."
3366,9,14,Group,"[all wave] Hi, Michael."
3367,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","As most of you know I once lost my job and my family because of my drinking. But with the help of AA I've been sober for ten years now. [the group claps] Anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups, for starters?"
3368,9,14,Man 1,"[stands up] My name's Bill, and Im an alcoholic."
3369,9,14,Group,Hi Bill.
3370,9,14,Randy Marsh,[subdued] Hi Bill.
3371,9,14,Bill,"I've been using the 12-step program for about two months now and, and I'm really turning my life around. No more blowing guys on Colfax Avenue for a pint of vodka for THIS cowboy! [the group claps. Bill sits down]"
3372,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","That's great. And I understand this is somebody's first AA meeting, is that right? [Randy points to himself]</> Y-yes, you sir. Stand on up and introduce yourself."
3373,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[rises] Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer."
3374,9,14,Man 2,You have to admit you're an alcoholic.
3375,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[slowly] But, I don't know if I'm really an alcoholic."
3376,9,14,Big Woman,Then why are you here?
3377,9,14,Randy Marsh,Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
3378,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","Randy, you are powerless to make that decision. The only thing that works is the 12-step program. [points out the 12 steps] Step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking. Only then can you move on to the other 12 steps, like, believing that only a higher power, God, makes you stop drinking. And then, turning your life over to that God and, humbly asking God to remove your weaknesses."
3379,9,14,Randy Marsh,"What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing."
3380,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","Well it's not religious. You just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness. That's the 12-step program, not religion."
3381,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again."
3382,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","[approaches Randy] You just can't cut down on your drinking, Randy. You need to know something. You have a disease."
3383,9,14,Randy Marsh,Uh... a disease?
3384,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","That's right. Alcoholism is a disease. You're sick, Randy. You're very very sick. And just like with most diseases, you can't cure it yourself. And it's deadly."
3385,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[appalled by the ""diagnosis""] Oh my God..."
3386,9,14,Stan Marsh,Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
3387,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[quivering] Hello, Stan."
3388,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!"
3389,9,14,Randy Marsh,"No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick."
3390,9,14,Stan Marsh,What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
3391,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. [coughs, drinks, and burps.]"
3392,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!"
3393,9,14,Randy Marsh,"I can't! I'm sick! [begins to cry and walks off in his blanket. He goes to the bathroom and closes the door, then goes to the vanity and looks in the mirror] It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?! [coughs as he cries, then takes some shears to his hair and shaves it off. Stan is about to pour milk into a glass downstairs] Stan! Stan! [Stan stops and sets the carton of milk down, then walks into the living room, where Randy is now seated in a wheelchair.] Stan."
3394,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Aww, Goddammit!"
3395,9,14,Randy Marsh,Stan I... need your help.
3396,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!"
3397,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?"
3398,9,14,Stan Marsh,No! You don't need another beer!
3399,9,14,Randy Marsh,[turns away and rolls off] I know that! But this disease is just eating me up! I hate my illness!
3400,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple."
3401,9,14,Randy Marsh,"I wish it was that simple, son. But if I don't give myself up to a higher power, this disease is going to kill me dead. I'm afraid the only thing that will cure me... is a miracle."
3402,9,14,Priest,"[softly] Es un milagro. [loudly]  Es un milagro! [immediately gets on his knees and crosses himself, then holds the bloodied finger upright]"
3403,9,14,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in the garden of St. Peter's church in Bailey, where what some call a miracle is taking place. The statue of the Virgin Mary has started to bleed. Out its ass. [an establishing shot of the statue] The phenomenon was first seen by Father Harold Barnes, [standing with the Spanish-speaking priest in front of the statue's backside] who saw the blood coming from the Virgin Mary's ass late last night. [back to the reporter] People from all over the state have flocked here to the church to witness the apparent miracle firsthand."
3404,9,14,Woman 1,"Well, we just heard that this miracle was happening and we wanted to see it for ourselves and come and pray."
3405,9,14,Field Reporter,Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood?
3406,9,14,Woman 2,Well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world.
3407,9,14,Field Reporter,"Why do you believe the Virgin Mary is dripping blood out her ass? [both women stay silent] As news of the miracle spreads, hundreds are expected to show up here at the church, hoping to witness the miracle, and even cure their diseases."
3408,9,14,Randy Marsh,Cure... cure disease. STAN!!
3409,9,14,Man 3,My name is Harry and I'm an alcoholic.
3410,9,14,Group,Hi Harry.
3411,9,14,Harry,"I've been sober now for five years and I I've learned that drinking ice tea and, and getting more involved with my relationship with God is, is, is way more fun than partying."
3412,9,14,Woman 2,It it sure is.
3413,9,14,Harry,"Once I accepted that I was powerless to control my drinking and my life, I I put it in God's hands and now, these meeting are the most fun thing I do."
3414,9,14,Man 4,Yeah. [Stan enters the meeting room and walks up towards the front]
3415,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?"
3416,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others",None of us are in charge. We're all powerless.
3417,9,14,Group,We sure are. That's right. Uh huh.
3418,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?"
3419,9,14,Harry,Alcoholism is a disease.
3420,9,14,Stan Marsh,"No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac"
3421,9,14,Man 2,It is a disease because it's a physical dependency. That makes it a disease.
3422,9,14,Stan Marsh,"No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less."
3423,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others",He can't quit by himself. None of us could. He needs divine intervention. Spirituality.
3424,9,14,Stan Marsh,"No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself."
3425,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","Young man, do you know anything about the 12-Step Program?"
3426,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while. [he is promptly kicked out] Goddammit! [walks off]"
3427,9,14,Field Reporter,"The crowd grows larger every hour, as the statue of the Virgin Mary continues to miraculously cry blood... out her ass. A Cardinal, Mallory, has been sent by the Vatican to determine whether this is a true miracle or not. [the cardinal and two assistants walk into the grotto]"
3428,9,14,Father Harold Barnes,"[showing the Cardinal where to go.] Right this way, Cardinal. [the cardinal, priests, and assistants go behind the statue] The blood always comes from the same area. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. [the Cardinal walks into position and begins to take a good look. He puts on his glasses and looks again. He looks even closer, and a stream of blood shoots at his eyes. His face and bust are full of blood as he moves from the back of the statue to the front. He wipes gobs of blood from his glasses and mouth and tosses them to the floor]"
3429,9,14,Cardinal Mallory,[Irish accent] It's a miracle! [the waiting crowd cheers]
3430,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[burps] Uh, kay, here we go. [gets into position]"
3431,9,14,Stan Marsh,"[rushes up] Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!"
3432,9,14,Randy Marsh,I gotta drive to Bailey. [chugs another beer]
3433,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!"
3434,9,14,Randy Marsh,"No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass."
3435,9,14,Stan Marsh,"[stays quiet, then] What??"
3436,9,14,Randy Marsh,They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!
3437,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!"
3438,9,14,Randy Marsh,[thinks] Alright... then you drive. [points to Stan]
3439,9,14,Stan Marsh,... I'm eight!
3440,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[makes a fist with his right hand] This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!"
3441,9,14,Randy Marsh,"I sure hope this works. No. No, it will work! I have to put my faith in a higher power. I HAVE to believe that this will work! [looks off to his left] There! There's the church! Stop right here, Stan!"
3442,9,14,Stan Marsh,Where? I can't see.
3443,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal! [Stan manages to pull into a spot] Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. [takes another chug of beer]"
3444,9,14,Randy Marsh,Is this the line? [Stan's eyes open wide. Before them is a long line leading up to the grotto] Oh God! [gets in line] Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
3445,9,14,Man 5,Yeah. I was diagnosed with brain cancer two months ago. I feel like this is my only hope.
3446,9,14,Randy Marsh,I know exactly how you feel. I've got alcoholism.
3447,9,14,Stan Marsh,[covers his eyes] Oh my God...
3448,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Wait a minute. Stan, isn't that Josh Garrett up there? He's from South Park. Maybe he'll let us in line with him."
3449,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, let's just wait our turn."
3450,9,14,Randy Marsh,"I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go! [Stan wheels him up to Josh.] Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?"
3451,9,14,Josh Garrett,"Oh, hey Randy. What happened to you??"
3452,9,14,Randy Marsh,I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
3453,9,14,Josh Garrett,Mm-my  daughter has elephantitis [the camera pans down to a horribly deformed girl with a bad breathing condition and crutches.]
3454,9,14,Randy Marsh,"We are the same, she and I."
3455,9,14,Man 6,"Eey, what do you think you're doin', kid?"
3456,9,14,Old Woman,[in her wheelchair]You're trying to cut in line!
3457,9,14,Stan Marsh,"I just, my dad was-"
3458,9,14,Man 7,"[walks around the old woman] You're a butter! You're a dirty line cutter! [the statue is shown, and another elderly lady walks up to it. Father Barnes takes some blood from the statue's ass and forms a cross with it on the woman's forehead]"
3459,9,14,Old Woman 2,Praise Jesus. [walks away smiling. The crowd moves up on. Randy didn't return to the back of the line.]
3460,9,14,Randy Marsh,This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!
3461,9,14,Stan Marsh,What?!
3462,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[in hushed tones] You see that guy up there? I think he has a kidney disease. Every couple of minutes he gets out of line to go to the bathroom. When he leaves next, let's take his place."
3463,9,14,Stan Marsh,"No, Dad, people will see!"
3464,9,14,Randy Marsh,The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! [the line advances and Stan and Randy quickly move in and fill the space]
3465,9,14,Blind Man,Hey. I smell a butter.
3466,9,14,Woman 3,"He did, that kid just cut in line!"
3467,9,14,Man 8,"Back o'the line, butter!"
3468,9,14,Randy Marsh,I'm going to die!
3469,9,14,Stan Marsh,"[gets into position to move the wheelchair to the back of the line] Dad, we're going back!"
3470,9,14,Officer,What's goin' on here?
3471,9,14,Man 9,This kid's cutting in line!
3472,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Please, officer, you have to understand. I need a miracle way more than these people. I'm an alcoholic, and I'm powerless over it."
3473,9,14,Officer,"...I understand. My, my brother's an alcoholic. Here, let me push you to the front of the line. [Stan looks on a bit stunned]"
3474,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh bless you, sir! Bless you! [the line parts as the officer moves him] 'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through! [the officer moves him into position. Randy wheels himself closer] She's... beautiful. [the statue squirts a long stream of blood on him and he rejoices in it] Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah! [opens his eyes, and the statue quickly squirts him one more time. He then wheels himself into view and struggles to get up from the wheelchair. He still has a bottle with him] I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this! [throws the bottle off somewhere] It's a miracle! I'm cured! [begins to dance away. Stan is embarrassed and stewing] Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! [runs off]"
3475,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day. [reaches over and kisses Sharon, then goes to his seat at table] It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. [looks at his kids]"
3476,9,14,Stan Marsh,Praise Christ.
3477,9,14,Shelly Marsh,Praise Christ.
3478,9,14,Randy Marsh,"I've got another AA meeting today and guess where it's gonna be, Stan. At Whistlin' Willy's Pizza, so you can come with me."
3479,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Naw, Dad, all the guys are going to Kyle's hosue to watch the Bronco game. Kenny and Kyle's Dads were hoping you'd come."
3480,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Stan, those people drink. I have new friends now. My AA friends, who have faith in a higher power."
3481,9,14,Group,"Yeah, all right, woohoo! [Randy and Stan sit among Randy's new friends and their kids.]"
3482,9,14,Randy Marsh,Boy this lemonade is great! Who knew how fun being sober could be?!
3483,9,14,Group,Yeah! That's right! Right!
3484,9,14,Boy,Your dad doesn't drink either?
3485,9,14,Stan Marsh,"No, my dad doesn't drink."
3486,9,14,Boy,Does that mean we're friends? [Stan just looks over at him]
3487,9,14,Randy Marsh,"'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may."
3488,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","Sure Randy, go ahead."
3489,9,14,Randy Marsh,[rises] I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic.
3490,9,14,Group,Hi Randy.
3491,9,14,Randy Marsh,"But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! [the group cheers him on, but behind him another news report pops up]"
3492,9,14,Field Reporter,An update from the bleeding Virgin Mary statue!
3493,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[turns around and reacts] Oh wait. Sh sh. Hold on a second, gang. [the group queits down]"
3494,9,14,Field Reporter,"Earlier today, the new pope, Pope Benedict the 16th himself, visited the statue here in Bailey to witness the miracle firsthand. [Footage of the pope walking through the crowd. People left and right kneel before him in reverence] It was an amazing sight to behold as Pope Benedict made his way through the throngs of people."
3495,9,14,Cardinal Mallory,"Right this way, Your Holiness."
3496,9,14,Field Reporter,"The pope then examined the statue closely. [the pope draw closer... closer... blinks, gets closer... looks at the camera and raises his eyebrows quickly twice, turns back and gets closer, gets a stream of blood on his face, about as much as Randy got] After witnessing the phenomenon firsthand, the pope then cleaned himself off and then declared that the bleeding Virgin Mary statue is not a miracle!"
3497,9,14,Randy Marsh,What?
3498,9,14,Field Reporter,"Having investigated closely, the pope determined that the blood was not coming from the Virgin Mary's ass, but rather, from her vagina. And the pope said quote, ""A chick bleeding out her vagina is no miracle. Chicks bleed out their vagina's all the time."" [a graphic with those words appears on screen, along with an image of the pope and his name, Pope Benedict XVI] Back to you, Tom."
3499,9,14,Tom,"Thanks, Edward, that's a very shocking report..."
3500,9,14,Randy Marsh,"That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease! [throws his mug of lemonade away and heads for the bar] Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters! [getting frantic] Come ON! Let's GO!"
3501,9,14,"AA members: Michael (leader), Bill, others","Randy, uh what are you doing?"
3502,9,14,Randy Marsh,You heard what he said! [gathers his drinks and carries them] The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!
3503,9,14,Man 1,"I'm, I'm, I'm powerless too!"
3504,9,14,Man 11,Yeah me too!
3505,9,14,Man 1,Get me seven martinis!
3506,9,14,Man 12,Jack and Coke!
3507,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, Dad, Stop!"
3508,9,14,Randy Marsh,"[turns around, dropping an empty bottle] I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon!"
3509,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you don't have to do this! You have the power. You haven't drank since seeing the statue."
3510,9,14,Randy Marsh,But the statue wasn't a miracle!
3511,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. The statue wasn't a miracle, Dad. So that means you did it. That means you didn't have a drink for five days all on your own."
3512,9,14,Randy Marsh,"You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. [throws off all his drinks, and they shatter on the pavement.]"
3513,9,14,Stan Marsh,No!
3514,9,14,Randy Marsh,No??
3515,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all."
3516,9,14,Randy Marsh,"But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing."
3517,9,14,Stan Marsh,"Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. [Randy looks at Stan for a moment, then walks up to his side and kneels next to him.]"
3518,9,14,Randy Marsh,How did I manage to raise such a smart kid?
3519,9,14,Stan Marsh,I've had a great teacher.
3520,9,14,Randy Marsh,Thanks son.
3521,9,14,Stan Marsh,"No not you, my karate teacher. He's really smart."
3522,9,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two."
3523,9,14,Stan Marsh,All right!
3524,9,14,Randy Marsh,[lifts up his son and places him on his shoulders] Come on! [they begin to walk] Or maybe I'll have three beers. [they walk off towards the sunset in the street. Their shadows are long on the pavement as the sun blazes on the horizon]
3525,9,14,Stan Marsh,That's probably okay if you spread it out.
3526,9,14,Randy Marsh,Well how about four?
3527,9,14,Stan Marsh,I think you're pushing it.
3528,9,14,Randy Marsh,How about twenty?
3529,9,14,Stan Marsh,That's not disciprine.
3530,9,14,Randy Marsh,Right right. Does vodka count?
3531,9,14,Stan Marsh,Dad!
