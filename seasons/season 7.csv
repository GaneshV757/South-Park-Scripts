0,7,1,The Boys,"School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day..."
1,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, damn it!"
2,7,1,Eric Cartman,What?
3,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!"
4,7,1,Ike Broflovski,Suck my balls.
5,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. [Ike chortles]"
6,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!"
7,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!"
8,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead! [the boys laugh, Kyle picks up Ike and swings him towards Cartman. Ike smacks Cartman in the face and Cartman falls on his back] Ow!"
9,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, sweet! [Ike stands up]"
10,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Check it out. [sets up Ike and prepares for a kick] Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
11,7,1,Ike Broflovski,Don't kick the goddamn baby!
12,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Kick it!
13,7,1,Ike Broflovski,Waaaah-- [flies across the street and lands in some snow on the other side] Ow.
14,7,1,Eric Cartman,[gets up and yawns] Uuugh.
15,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
16,7,1,Eric Cartman,That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
17,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Really? What about?
18,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed… [the dream sequence begins] in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room [his window flies open and a bright beam blinds him as he rises to see what it is]. Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open [a glow appears around the door as an alien peeks inside] and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway. [This hallway has specimens on either side of it. ""Weeaak!""] Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me. [four aliens hover over him and lower his pajama pants as a robot arm nearby gets to work on his ass] And they had big heads and big black eyes…"
19,7,1,Stan Marsh,Dude! Visitors!
20,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Totally!
21,7,1,Eric Cartman,What?
22,7,1,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!"
23,7,1,Eric Cartman,"No, it was just a dream, [crosses his arms] my mom said so."
24,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Visitors are real. They... [lowers his left eyebrow and thinks, looking down] Wait a minute. This has all happened before."
25,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
26,7,1,Eric Cartman,What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
27,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?"
28,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me."
29,7,1,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?"
30,7,1,Eric Cartman,No I don't remember that!
31,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,You don't?
32,7,1,Eric Cartman,"No, because the aliens erased my memory!"
33,7,1,Stan Marsh,"I remember this whole thing. [to Kyle] Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream."
34,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. [the sound of wheels approaching]"
35,7,1,Chef,"[pulling up in his station wagon, steps out] Hello there, children! [silence]"
36,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,[to Stan] And then you said
37,7,1,Stan Marsh,"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?"
38,7,1,Chef,"Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles"
39,7,1,All,and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley.
40,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Weird
41,7,1,Chef,"Say, did any of you children"
42,7,1,All,see the alien space ship last night?
43,7,1,Chef,What the?
44,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we're in a repeat."
45,7,1,Chef,A repeat??
46,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
47,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Aw dude, I hate repeats!"
48,7,1,Chef,"[walks around and stands behind the boys] I've been feelin' Déjà vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!"
49,7,1,Stan Marsh,It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
50,7,1,Chef,We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
51,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"What is a proc-tologist, Chef?"
52,7,1,Chef,"He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children."
53,7,1,Stan Marsh,"You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes."
54,7,1,Chef,That's right.
55,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,What a dick!
56,7,1,Proctologist,[entering] Hello everyone! [walks towards Cartman]
57,7,1,Chef,Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.
58,7,1,Proctologist,What seems to be the problem?
59,7,1,Chef,We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
60,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Other than his monstrous size.
61,7,1,Eric Cartman,"[whips an angry look at him] SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! [pulls his head back and rests it on his left hand]"
62,7,1,Proctologist,"All right, let's see here. [raises the blanket and looks down] Oh my God!!"
63,7,1,Eric Cartman,What?
64,7,1,Proctologist,"Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle! [beat. The doctor begins to laugh]"
65,7,1,Eric Cartman,"[displeased] Haha, very funny."
66,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times."
67,7,1,Proctologist,"[chuckles] All right, let's take a look. [snaps on a yellow latex glove and plunges a finger into the butthole]"
68,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?"
69,7,1,Chef,"Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum."
70,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it."
71,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Oww."
72,7,1,Proctologist,Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...
73,7,1,Eric Cartman,Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
74,7,1,Proctologist,"Wait, what's this? [the anal probe appears once again and the doctor jumps out of the way. The probe stretches out and clears away part of the clinic on its way to full height. A large hole is left on the building as the satellite dish juts out from it.]"
75,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Are you okay?
76,7,1,Eric Cartman,"[with a dreamy, relieved look] Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! [smiles]"
77,7,1,Chef,"Well, doctor?"
78,7,1,Proctologist,"[slowly] I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream."
79,7,1,Eric Cartman,[the probe collapses and sinks back into his ass] Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
80,7,1,Stan Marsh,You all right?
81,7,1,Eric Cartman,"You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!!"
82,7,1,Proctologist,I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.
83,7,1,Chef,"That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!"
84,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Where to now, Chef?"
85,7,1,Chef,That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! [as they leave the clinic they pass the receptionist's window. A receptionist with a weird white face and yellow hair looks on as they leave. She then removes her wig and shows that she's a Visitor.]
86,7,1,Chef,"And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff."
87,7,1,Jeff,"How do we uh, make it come out?"
88,7,1,Chef,Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
89,7,1,Eric Cartman,[crosses his arms] Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. [grins]
90,7,1,Stan Marsh,What?
91,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No way! [looks to his left and points] You do it, Kenny!"
92,7,1,Eric Cartman,Nope! It has to be Kyle!
93,7,1,Stan Marsh,Go on.
94,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
95,7,1,Chef,"Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake."
96,7,1,Eric Cartman,"[lowers his pants and moons Kyle] Come, Kyle. Do hurry. [Kyle moves tentatively toward Cartman and bares his left arm] Go ahead, it won't bite. [Kyle raises his arm and move in. Cartman farts and Kyle angrily lowers his arm. Cartman and Kenny laugh]"
97,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,God-damnit Cartman!
98,7,1,Eric Cartman,[laughing] I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]
99,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Stop it Cartman!
100,7,1,Eric Cartman,[laughing] Okay. Okay okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]
101,7,1,Kenny McCormick,"[laughing] (Gaaahaha, he got you again!)"
102,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,God Dammit!
103,7,1,Eric Cartman,"[laughing] Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm, looking at the other guys.] Gahaaa! Derrr!"
104,7,1,Kenny McCormick,"[laughs, then echoes Cartman] (Derrr!)"
105,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Oh yes it is! [swats the odor towards Kyle.]"
106,7,1,Kenny McCormick,"[laughs, then echoes Cartman] (Yes it is!)"
107,7,1,Chef,"Eric, that's enough!"
108,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohh, double psych!"
109,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,That's it! [walks off] I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
110,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, nice going, Cartman!"
111,7,1,Eric Cartman,"All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle."
112,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,No!
113,7,1,Eric Cartman,"No, go ahead. I'm dry."
114,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,You're lying!
115,7,1,Chef,"It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!"
116,7,1,Eric Cartman,But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
117,7,1,Jeff,"Can I see this thing, please?"
118,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohhh! God-dammit! [Cartman, Kenny, and Chef laugh]"
119,7,1,Chef,Okay. Now it's funny again.
120,7,1,Eric Cartman,"This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven."
121,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,That does it! CHARGE! [drives his finger into Cartman's butthole. Cartman farts and screams as the anal probe shoot out of his ass. The probe opens up into the satellite dish and the dish sends a beam into outer space. Part of the space center is destroyed in the process]
122,7,1,Chef,What's it doing?
123,7,1,Jeff,"It, it's sending a transmission of some kind. [sits at a console and types away] Got it! [on several screen above the keyboard, images from around the planet pop up and change every second or so.]"
124,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
125,7,1,Chef,Where is the signal being sent to? [the signal cuts off and the anal probe shrinks back into Cartman's ass. Cartman screams as it does so.]
126,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys."
127,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
128,7,1,Stan Marsh,We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
129,7,1,Jeff,"Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars."
130,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Candy bars?
131,7,1,Jeff,"You-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... pola... polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to! [turns around and types away on the console. The power cuts out and the center goes dark.] What the heck? [the sound of heavy ships is heard, and two bright beams light up the room. Everyone looks towards a window. Outside, a visitor walks up and looks in through one end window. A second one looks through the other end window. The windows shatter] They're coming in! [a glow appears outside a door and permeates it. The door shuts and two visitors enter. The other two come in through the window and the four of them converge on the boys, Chef, and Jeff.]"
132,7,1,Stan Marsh,What do we do???
133,7,1,Eric Cartman,[steps forward and points to Jeff] It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
134,7,1,Jeff,"What?? [the visitors go after Jeff, and the others make their escape]"
135,7,1,Chef,Help!
136,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Aaaah! Runrunruuun! [the group makes it outside]
137,7,1,Stan Marsh,Let's go!
138,7,1,Chef,"Get in the car, children! Get in the car! [they all scramble in and Chef peels away from the center. He drives down the road towards South Park. Another car appears behind then and throws up its headlights. Its horn honks a few times]"
139,7,1,Stan Marsh,[startled] What is that?
140,7,1,Chef,"Can you see anything, children? [Kyle looks back]"
141,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns back] The aliens are chasing us! [a close-up of the four aliens in the car behind Chef. A passenger-side visitor leans out and draws a revolver, shooting at Chef. A bullet strikes the rear window and the boys jump]"
142,7,1,Chef,God damned aliens! [the two cars move down the road with the visitors still shooting]
143,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef! End of the road! [several barricades are up, with STOP signs hanging on the, and one sign saying ""ROAD CLOSED""]"
144,7,1,Chef,"Hold on, children! [Cartman looks at the visitors] We have to ditch them! [steps on the gas pedal]"
145,7,1,Eric Cartman,"What are you doing, man?! [Chef drives towards the barricade and goes up a wooden ramp, into the air.]"
146,7,1,Announcers and Narrator,"[some backwoods music plays in the background in freeze-frame] Looks like them boys are gettin' a little fresh air. [the wagon lands on the other side of a pothole and continues. The visitors try the same jump, but they launch into the air and off the road, towards a chicken coop. They crash through the roof and land right in the middle of the coop. Chickens ]"
147,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,[looks out and back] I think we ditched them.
148,7,1,Chef,"I don't think we're outta the woods yet. [they pass a sign saying ""eat BIG PIG'S BBQ"" with a pig in a white Southern suit. Behind the billboard, a police car pulls out and pursues Chef. There are two visitors in the car]"
149,7,1,Visitor Driver,Coop coop.
150,7,1,Stan Marsh,It's the police!
151,7,1,Chef,"That ain't no police! [for some reason, two workers are moving a large glass pane across the road. Chef heads on down and crashes through it. The police cruiser follows]"
152,7,1,Eric Cartman,When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
153,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef!! [Chef sees yet another barricade and goes towards it, forcing the worker guarding it to jump out of the way/ Chef launches into the air once again. ""Dixie"" is heard from the car's horn. The aliens catch up to Chef and the boys and try the same jump. They end up upside down and unable to move. Chef spins the car a bit and looks back at the police cruiser]"
154,7,1,Chef,"[jumps out and approaches the police car] HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you! [a beam lights up the car] Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! [the car begins to rise slowly]"
155,7,1,The Boys,Chef! Chef! They've got us!
156,7,1,Chef,You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to... [notices the weird sounds behind him and turns] Huh? [looks up to see the station wagon hovering near the entrance to the ship] Aw crap! Children!
157,7,1,The Boys,Cheeeeeeef!
158,7,1,Announcers and Narrator,"[the picture freezes] Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too."
159,7,1,Stan Marsh,Uh. [stirs and opens his eyes] Wugh. You guys. Wake up! [the other boys are in pods of their own]
160,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[stirs in his own pod] What the? Where are, where are we?"
161,7,1,Stan Marsh,We're in the alien ship.
162,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass! [panics] Oh God, help me you guys!"
163,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
164,7,1,Eric Cartman,"[looks down] ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord."
165,7,1,Stan Marsh,[out of his pod] Guys. Look. [the others get out of theirs and walk towards Stan]
166,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow. [they face a massive window, through which they get a good view of Earth getting farther and farther away]"
167,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Wow. [they face a massive window, through which they get a good view of Earth getting farther and farther away]"
168,7,1,Stan Marsh,"My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space."
169,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
170,7,1,Kenny McCormick,(Awesome)
171,7,1,Eric Cartman,This is like my fifth time. [the room brightens and two doors open at the other end of the room. The boys turn and face it]
172,7,1,Stan Marsh,Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
173,7,1,Kenny McCormick,(Oh no!) [tightens the hood on his face. The man enters... it appears to be Stan's father.]
174,7,1,Alien,Hello boys.
175,7,1,Stan Marsh,Dad?
176,7,1,Alien,"No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you."
177,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay."
178,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact."
179,7,1,Eric Cartman,"Aw God, that movie pissed me off."
180,7,1,Alien,"Very well, I shall show my true form. [a quick transformation into a hideous monster] Rah rah rah rah rah. Rah rah rah rah."
181,7,1,The Boys,[shielding their eyes] AAAAH!
182,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Okay okay, take the form of something else!"
183,7,1,Alien,[transforms again] How's this? [the boys move their arms off their eyes to behold Santa]
184,7,1,Eric Cartman,Santa!
185,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Nno, that's stupid too. [Cartman looks at Stan, deflated]"
186,7,1,Alien,"How about this? [transforms into Michael Jordan, Bulls form]"
187,7,1,Stan Marsh,No. [the alien turns into Don King] No! [then into Mr. Roarke and Tattoo]
188,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,No. [the alien turns into Don King] No! [then into Mr. Roarke and Tattoo]
189,7,1,Eric Cartman,No. [the alien turns into Don King] No! [then into Mr. Roarke and Tattoo]
190,7,1,Eric Cartman,"[impressed] Oooo, very nice."
191,7,1,Stan Marsh,No! [the alien turns into George Burns]
192,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,No! [the alien turns into J.J. Walker]
193,7,1,Alien,Dy-no-mite!
194,7,1,The Boys,No!
195,7,1,Chef,[with flashlight] Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship.
196,7,1,Jeff,Oh no!
197,7,1,Chef,Did you find out what the aliens were up to?
198,7,1,Jeff,"When I reversed the polarities, I found this: [sits at the console and starts pressing keys. 1s and 0s flash across a screen] It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says."
199,7,1,Chef,"They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!"
200,7,1,Jeff,[spins around] Wait a minute! Butt sex!
201,7,1,Chef,Butt sex?
202,7,1,Jeff,"Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh... Chupacabra's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usually have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code! [spins back and works on decoding it]"
203,7,1,Chef,Who's havin' butt sex?
204,7,1,Alien,"[prances as Saddam] Hello my honey, hello my baby, hello my ragtime gal! [ends on his knees, arms wide open]"
205,7,1,The Boys,[getting bored] No!
206,7,1,Alien,"[transforms into Missy Elliot] Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh huh."
207,7,1,The Boys,No! [Stan is irritated]
208,7,1,Alien,"[transforms into Frank Sinatra] Don't piss on the moon, babe."
209,7,1,The Boys,NO!
210,7,1,Alien,"All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take? [the boys fall silent]"
211,7,1,Eric Cartman,"How about a taco, that craps ice cream? [the alien transforms into the taco. A wad of ice cream falls out of him] Guys?"
212,7,1,Stan Marsh,I like it.
213,7,1,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.) [the boys clap]
214,7,1,Alien,"All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings. [leads the boys into another room, leaving scoops of ice cream behind, in various flavors] I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay."
215,7,1,Stan Marsh,"You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?"
216,7,1,Alien,"That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning."
217,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
218,7,1,Alien,"Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches. [enters the next room]"
219,7,1,Stan Marsh,[looks back at his friends] Television? [the boys enter the next room. In that room visitors are all over the place manning the various aspects of a production company]
220,7,1,Alien,"We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] We started with great shows like, ""Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek?"" and ""Antares 6 Millionaire"". And then we had a big hit with ""Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian"". But then of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time. [he looks at a giant screen on which Earth is shown]"
221,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Earth?
222,7,1,Alien,"A few billion years ago we realized, ""what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?"" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great! [the boys are stunned at what they're hearing]"
223,7,1,Stan Marsh,Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
224,7,1,Alien,"Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!"
225,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up."
226,7,1,Alien,Why?
227,7,1,Stan Marsh,Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
228,7,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! [the boys just look at each other]
229,7,1,Jeff,"Ladies and Gentleman, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe. [murmurs rise up in the audience] When decoded, it looks like this. [he begins the transmission and graphics sweep by. First, the binary code appears, then a dazzling sun behind the Earth, then a tracking shot leading to Earth, then an undernourished boy, then a caravan walking across a desert, people putting on protective glasses, an atomic blast, deer running, a couple, a time-lapse night scene, the Eiffel Tower, two men hammering at something, an ethnic festival. The sound is garbled]"
230,7,1,Man,[rising] What does it mean?
231,7,1,Jeff,"It's simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this. [replays the transmission, this time in English]"
232,7,1,Announcer,"This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!"
233,7,1,Jeff,"I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show."
234,7,1,Man 2,My God. We're famous! [everyone stands and whoops it up]
235,7,1,Jeff,"Waaaait, you don't understand!"
236,7,1,Man 3,[giddy blond] I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
237,7,1,Man 4,"This is so awesome! [everyone clear out, cheering]"
238,7,1,Others,Woo! Yeah! Woohoo!! [Jeff is left all alone]
239,7,1,Alien,"That should get the relay working again. [begins to walk off. The boys follow] All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth. [a visitor brings him a ringing phone] Oh, excuse me. [picks up the receiver] This is Nagix. Uh huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks. [hangs up the phone and walks back to the boys] Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been cancelled."
240,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?? Who cancelled us?
241,7,1,Nagix (Ice-cream-crapping Taco),"The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be funny anymore. [walks off to address the rest of the staff]"
242,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh shit, did we do that?"
243,7,1,Nagix (Ice-cream-crapping Taco),"Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid Earth has been cancelled"
244,7,1,Staff,Awww.
245,7,1,Nagix (Ice-cream-crapping Taco),"Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud. [a smattering of applause] Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources."
246,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!"
247,7,1,Nagix (Ice-cream-crapping Taco),Wouldn't do any good.
248,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we have to try!"
249,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Please, take us to them! Please!"
250,7,1,Nagix (Ice-cream-crapping Taco),"All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody. [the boys look at each other, and several more scoops of ice cream falls out of the alien's taco ass]"
251,7,1,Chef,What the hell is that?!
252,7,1,Jeff,"There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit! [schematics of the ship and of Earth appear on screen, and the impact point is shown as well] But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory!"
253,7,1,Chef,Chaos theory??
254,7,1,Jeff,"Chaos theory, it was, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of Punky Brewster before it was cancelled. Cancelled..."
255,7,1,Chef,Huh?
256,7,1,Jeff,Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are canceling Earth!
257,7,1,Chef,Oh my God! We have to stop them!
258,7,1,Voice,"Welcome to Planet Fognl, home of the Joozians, who control all media in the universe. [the boys enter the universal network headquarters]"
259,7,1,Receptionist,Can I help you?
260,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?"
261,7,1,Receptionist,Where are you visiting from?
262,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Earth?"
263,7,1,Receptionist,"Oooo, I watch that show all the time. [opens another set of doors and shows the boys in]"
264,7,1,Joozian 1,"Gaaahahaha. [notices the boys come in] Oh, sure, come on in, Earthlings. We're just checking out our new show."
265,7,1,Joozian 2,We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. It-it's a riot!
266,7,1,Joozian 1,They hate each other!
267,7,1,Joozian 2,"Gah, why? [Stan nudges Kyle, who pulls a letter out from his pocket and reads]"
268,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Mighty powerful network executives
269,7,1,Joozian 1,"Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have haglar yet?"
270,7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh yeah, let's do haglar."
271,7,1,Joozian 1,Where do you wanna go? Meroni's?
272,7,1,Joozian 2,"Not on a Flakmar. Too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch!"
273,7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect."
274,7,1,Joozian 2,This place is fantastic!
275,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Look, we just want to talk to you about the show."
276,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Please don't cancel us. Please.
277,7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business."
278,7,1,Joozian 2,"You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!"
279,7,1,Joozian 1,"Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings."
280,7,1,Waitress,[another Joozian] Here's your order of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah. [sets a large platter before the executives and lifts the cover. The executives dig in]
281,7,1,Stan Marsh,"But sirs, we think our show is just getting good. [Kyle thinks about the food, then decides to taste it] I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other."
282,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, this is great!"
283,7,1,Joozian 1,You must have some Joozian ancestry.
284,7,1,Eric Cartman,"[miffed at the link, rests his head on his left hand] Tell us about it!"
285,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us."
286,7,1,Joozian 1,Oh my God! Would you look at the heglars on that joozinek?
287,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!"
288,7,1,Joozian 1,Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah!
289,7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh, yeah!"
290,7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh yeah, let's see those heglars!"
291,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-"
292,7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh, man, I am so wasted! [holds up a little box] Hey, do you Earthlings wanna try a little glach? [takes the box and pours out a line of purple powder. The other Joozian snorts it right up. The boys look on, saying nothing. Another line of purple powder and the first Joozian snorts up, then suddenly turns around] Agh-oh yeah!! [turns back] Oh, gluck yeah!! [Kenny begins snorting up at the other end of the line]"
293,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! [Kenny stops]
294,7,1,Joozian 1,"Meeh, screw this place! Let's go get a hotel room and a hooker!"
295,7,1,Joozian 2,Oh yeah!
296,7,1,Joozian 1,Yeah! [they leave their chairs]
297,7,1,Chef,We have to find a way to stop those aliens!
298,7,1,Jeff,"[begins pacing] Oh, their ship is massive! There's no way to stop it! [stops] Wait a minute, jackets!"
299,7,1,Chef,[smacks his hand onto his head] Oh no.
300,7,1,Jeff,If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A viru- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!
301,7,1,Chef,"[thinks, then angrily] That doesn't make any God-damned sense!"
302,7,1,Joozian 2,Ogh.
303,7,1,Joozian 1,Oh yeah!
304,7,1,Joozian 2,Good.
305,7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh yeah! Yeah!! [goes to take another snort of purple powder. With his shirt off, one can see two small appendages, one on each shoulder]"
306,7,1,Joozian 2,Woohoohoo! Yeah!
307,7,1,Joozian 1,"Booyagh! Boy, Earthlings, is this a party or what?? [the boys sit on a couch looking on, bored.]"
308,7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh! Oh, that's it baby! You're getting my jagon hard! [the appendage on his right shoulder stiffens and lengthens]"
309,7,1,Joozian 1,"[returns to the side of the bed, by the second Joozian] Wohh. Yeah, let's party! [begins to suck on the Joozian's jagon]"
310,7,1,Joozian 2,"Yeah, suck my jagon!"
311,7,1,Joozian 1,"[stops and releases] Yeah! Now you suck on my jagon! [the second Joozian begins to suck on his jagon] Oh yeah!! Stick your finger in my thrusher! [the second Joozian begins putting his finger into some openings above the first Joozian's waist] Oh yeah, suck it. Suck that jagon! [the boys show more interest and some astonishment]"
312,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. [Kenny whips out a camera and takes a picture]"
313,7,1,Joozian 1,[the other Joozian continues sucking on his jagon] Oh yes!! Oh yeah yeahyeah! Oh yeah!
314,7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh, God. Eh eh, my head. [the four boys look on] What did we do?"
315,7,1,Joozian 1,"Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your jagon."
316,7,1,Joozian 2,"Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right??"
317,7,1,Eric Cartman,No.
318,7,1,Stan Marsh,"[glances at Cartman and quickly thinks] No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!"
319,7,1,Joozian 1,"Oooo, I knew that was coming."
320,7,1,Joozian 2,They really got us by the nezmins.
321,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
322,7,1,Stan Marsh,"I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent."
323,7,1,Eric Cartman,There's even World War Three to look forward to.
324,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
325,7,1,Joozian 1,"He-all right, all right Earthlings! Ya, you win! The show can stay on."
326,7,1,The Boys,All right!
327,7,1,Joozian 1,Just be sure to keep up the wars and violence.
328,7,1,Joozian 2,"Well, we've got a five o'clock with the Yurka producers. [still disheveled, he hops off his chair and goes to a lever] Nice meeting you Earthlings. Bye! [pulls the lever down and in an instant the boys are back at the bus stop]"
329,7,1,Eric Cartman,[yawns] Uuugh.
330,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
331,7,1,Eric Cartman,That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
332,7,1,Kenny McCormick,"[walks up with something in his hand] (Hey you guys, look.) [the other boys look]"
333,7,1,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is that?
334,7,1,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know.)
335,7,1,Chef,"[drives up in his station wagon and steps out] Hello there, children!"
336,7,1,The Boys,Hey Chef. [Chef steps behind the boys]
337,7,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. [Chef takes a look at the picture of the two Joozians sucking each other's jagons]"
338,7,1,Eric Cartman,"What is it, Chef?"
339,7,1,Chef,"I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children. [hands the picture back to Kenny] You should hang on to it."
340,7,1,Announcer,Attention universe! Be sure to tune in next week for another exciting episode of... Earth! The Asians [crowd scene] are reeeally steamed at the Russians [crossing a bridge]. The zebras try to get along with the buffalo. [composite shot] And Americans [walking the dog] and Iraqis [dancing] have an all-out brawl. [Saddam is shown] It's outrageous fun and it's all new! Earth! On Fognl.
341,7,2,Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for JIMMY! [the curtains part and Jimmy walks forward wearing a tuxedo] Thank you! Wow. What a terrific audience. [the curtains close behind him] I know what most of you are thinking. ""Hey, uh-that guy stole my show..."" [long pause] Wow, what a great audience. And how about this Michael Jackson guy, huh? I mean, come on... [long pause] Wow, what a great audience. [the soft sound of one person clapping is heard] Uh... l... lights, please? [the house lights click on and only one person is seen in the seats: Butters]"
342,7,2,Butters,Hey Jimmy.
343,7,2,Jimmy,"Butters, w-where is everybody?"
344,7,2,Butters,"Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him."
345,7,2,Jimmy,Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!
346,7,2,Butters,"You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman."
347,7,2,Jimmy,I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
348,7,2,Butters,"Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show."
349,7,2,Jimmy,"So then, how come you came?"
350,7,2,Butters,"Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? [Jimmy stews on stage]"
351,7,2,Mayor McDaniels,"And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve. [everyone claps and the curtains open. The mayor and her aides step aside. Christopher Reeve rolls out towards the mic. Jimmy shows up to watch.]"
352,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience. [stops to catch his breath with a fixed smile in place] I just flew into South Park. [catches his breath] Used to be I didn't need an airplane."
353,7,2,Townspeople,Awwwww. [a smattering of applause]
354,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"As most of you know, [catches his breath] I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research."
355,7,2,Jimmy,"Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! [""It is a proven fact that stem-cell research""]"
356,7,2,Cartman,We didn't go to your comedy show.
357,7,2,Jimmy,"I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious! [""can add many years to the lives of people who have been disabled by accidents""]"
358,7,2,Stan,"Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. [""or other ways.""]"
359,7,2,Jimmy,"Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!"
360,7,2,Kyle,"Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve."
361,7,2,Stan,"Yeah dude, not cool."
362,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"Though it is controversial, [catches his breath] stem cell research is critical [catches his breath] in the quest for helping [catches his breath] the disabled."
363,7,2,Jimmy,I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH! [waddles off in a huff]
364,7,2,Stan,"Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one."
365,7,2,Kyle,"Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. [they turn right and trot off]"
366,7,2,Timmy,Ha-a-aaa-haaa-a.
367,7,2,Jimmy,"[approaching] Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?"
368,7,2,Timmy,Timmeh!!
369,7,2,Jimmy,"Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much."
370,7,2,Timmy,Rrruh Timmeh!
371,7,2,Christopher Reeve,In the coming days [catches his breath] I will prove to the world [catches his breath] that stem-cell research is a miracle.
372,7,2,Cartman,"Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep."
373,7,2,Jimmy,Hey there fellas.
374,7,2,Stan,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy."
375,7,2,Timmy,Timmih!!
376,7,2,Jimmy,"Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. [start laughing. The boys go back to playing with their trucks.]"
377,7,2,Kyle,What?
378,7,2,Jimmy,"To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!"
379,7,2,Stan,"That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. [Jimmy and Timmy turn and walk away]"
380,7,2,Cartman,"[jumps up and catches up to them] Hey, wait a minute! [Timmy and Jimmy stop] You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!"
381,7,2,Jimmy,"Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join."
382,7,2,Cartman,Can too!
383,7,2,Jimmy,"[turns to Timmy] Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One. [begins to laugh. Timmy begins to laugh as well] You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. [Jimmy and Timmy laugh, and walk away laughing]"
384,7,2,Cartman,Oh God-damnit!!
385,7,2,Kyle,"Cartman, just stay out of it."
386,7,2,Cartman,But they say I can't be in their club!!
387,7,2,Stan,"Cartman, trust me. [Kenny pushes his own truck away] We don't want any part in this one."
388,7,2,Jimmy,"Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy. [Timmy has a box on his lap]"
389,7,2,Mr. McGillicuddy,"Hello, boys. What can I do for you?"
390,7,2,Jimmy,"[takes the box from Timmy] Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club. [Timmy beams with delight] We just came up with a name this morning. [McGillicuddy opens the box, pulls out the shirt, and his jaw drops. The shirt reads, ""THE CRIPS""]"
391,7,2,Mr. McGillicuddy,"Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts"
392,7,2,Jimmy,Why not?
393,7,2,Mr. McGillicuddy,"Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much."
394,7,2,Jimmy,[stunned] ...There's already a Crips?!
395,7,2,Mr. McGillicuddy,"Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them?"
396,7,2,Jimmy,"No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?"
397,7,2,Mr. McGillicuddy,"...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one. [leaves the counter]"
398,7,2,Jimmy,"Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it."
399,7,2,Timmy,[excited] Timmmeh!
400,7,2,Jimmy,Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
401,7,2,Larry King,"My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who, with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms."
402,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"Thanks for having me on again, Larry."
403,7,2,Larry King,"All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you. [with that fixed grin, Reeve strains to lift his right arm a few inches, then sets it down again.] Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that taking cells from a fetus is... unethical."
404,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated [catches his breath] about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one [pulls a dead fetus up from an unseen container] can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet."
405,7,2,Larry King,"And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?"
406,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"Well, it's very simple. [takes the fetus and cracks it open like a coconut, then sucks out its contents and tosses it aside] And now you can see, my arms have better movement."
407,7,2,Larry King,Wow. [begins clapping] Wow.
408,7,2,Jimmy,"Excuse me, sir. [the bum stops, startled] we're looking for a group of people called the Crips."
409,7,2,Bum,You are?
410,7,2,Jimmy,Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
411,7,2,Bum,"The Crips hang out at that old warehouse down there, [points to the building he just passed] but ...nobody goes in there."
412,7,2,Jimmy,"[moves forward] Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim."
413,7,2,Timmy,Timmmih! [follows]
414,7,2,Jimmy,"Well hello everyone. [music abruptly stops] I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy."
415,7,2,Timmy,"Timmmih! [awkward silence, then softly] Tih... ti-timmih."
416,7,2,Jimmy,"[to a friend at left, as he points to the duo] Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter."
417,7,2,Large Crip,"Is they for real, manh?"
418,7,2,Jimmy,"We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?"
419,7,2,Braided Crip,"The only Crips is born Crips, dawg."
420,7,2,Tall Crip,"Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!"
421,7,2,Jimmy,"I agree. I mean, it's like [enunciates] ""come on""! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?"
422,7,2,Timmy,Timmih! [silence]
423,7,2,Jimmy,"Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?"
424,7,2,Buff Crip,"All right, you wanna thug with the Five Point Crips? Bitches, all you gotta do is pop some punk-ass Bloods."
425,7,2,Jimmy,"Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it."
426,7,2,Timmy,Timmih?
427,7,2,Jimmy,"[turns and answers softly] I don't know, Timmy, just play along."
428,7,2,Timmy,Uh-tu-Timmih!
429,7,2,Buff Crip,So you sayin' yuh down?
430,7,2,Jimmy,"Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown. [music starts up again, and Timmy and Jimmy leave. As they walk down the street a rap song plays]"
431,7,2,Jimmy,"Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?"
432,7,2,Timmy,Timmih!
433,7,2,Jimmy,"That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park. [as they walk, a police car rolls up and the passenger-side officer calls out]"
434,7,2,Officer,Hey you kids.
435,7,2,Jimmy,"[stops and looks] Well hello, officers."
436,7,2,Officer,What the hell do you think you're doin'?
437,7,2,Jimmy,We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.
438,7,2,Timmy,Timmih! [the officers simply look at each other and drive off.]
439,7,2,Jimmy,"[sees something] Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store. [""Ribs N Gass."" A lot of gang members are milling around in front of the store] That must be what the fellas meant by ""pop some punk-ass Bloods."" They want us to get them some soda pop and treats. [the gang members notice them coming and stop to look. They cross the street] Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure."
440,7,2,Timmy,"Oh, Timmih. [a truck appears in the distance and comes up fast.]"
441,7,2,Driver,[noticing almost too late] Oh shit! [swerves to avoid the duo and slams into the convenience store they were trying to reach. The store and truck go up in a ball of flames while Jimmy and Timmy stop in their tracks]
442,7,2,Jimmy,"Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!"
443,7,2,Buff Crip,"Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell you about my little Gs, Roller and 4 Legs here. They just smoked thirteen Bloods in one night!"
444,7,2,Crip 1,One night?
445,7,2,Crip 2,You're kiddin'? You're kiddin'? One night?
446,7,2,Buff Crip,That ain't never been done before!
447,7,2,58 Crip,And they got us marshmallows and ginger ale.
448,7,2,Crips and Bloods,[chattering] Uh huh. Cool. He's right.
449,7,2,Jimmy,So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
450,7,2,Buff Crip,"You're not just in, you're the baddest mofo Crips in town! Cipac! [a Crip steps forward] Turn up the beat so we can celebrate our new Gs Five-Points style!"
451,7,2,Cipac,All right. [hobbles off]
452,7,2,Jimmy,"Wow, these guys really are crippled. [the music starts up and the Crips start dancing] Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant."
453,7,2,Timmy,Timmih!
454,7,2,Jimmy,"Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time."
455,7,2,Cipac,"Alrighty. Keep it real, dawg."
456,7,2,Jimmy,"You dawgs keep it real, too. [Cipac flashes the Crips signs for ""West Coast Crips"" and the boys return the gesture]"
457,7,2,Timmy,Timmih! [the Crips drive off]
458,7,2,Jimmy,"Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy."
459,7,2,Timmy,Timmih! [Jimmy goes on home as Timmy rolls off]
460,7,2,Mom,"[jumps up] There you are, Jimmy!"
461,7,2,Jimmy,"Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?"
462,7,2,Pops,"Jimmy, your mother was gettin' worried about you."
463,7,2,Jimmy,No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool. [turns and hobbles off]
464,7,2,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand."
465,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"[flanked by two doctors, one of them carrying a medical organ cooler] Thank you everyone. [pulls out a fetus from the cooler and holds it in his left hand] To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me, [lifts it into the air] it's hope. [snaps it open as before and sucks out its juices.]"
466,7,2,Crowd,Uugh.
467,7,2,Mr Garrison,[arm around Mr. Slave] What an inspiration.
468,7,2,Reporter,"Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now? [Reeve takes out another fetus and sucks it dry. Stan and the boys walk by]"
469,7,2,Stan,"[admonishing] Stay clear, guys, stay clear."
470,7,2,Kyle,Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
471,7,2,Mr Kim,"Hey [studies the boys before him, then holds up his arms] Hey, I don't want no trouble!"
472,7,2,Jimmy,"Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung... Pao Chicken, please."
473,7,2,Mr Kim,I don't want no trouble! You just... take what you want and leave!
474,7,2,Timmy,Timmih!
475,7,2,Mr Kim,"[as if Timmy had barked an order] OH! Okay, okay! [steps to the cash register and opens it] I open register"
476,7,2,Timmy,Timmih!
477,7,2,Jimmy,"What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please."
478,7,2,Timmy,Timmih.
479,7,2,Mr Kim,"[pulls out a stack of bills and sets them on the counter, then holds his arms up again] Here. Here one hundred twelve dorrar! It's all I have. Yeh take!"
480,7,2,Jimmy,[confused] Huh?
481,7,2,Mr Kim,You take! Uh one hundred twelve dorrar!
482,7,2,Jimmy,Ah- are you sure?
483,7,2,Mr Kim,I no want no trouble. Just take it and leave!
484,7,2,Jimmy,"[approaches the counter. Mr. Kim goes about preparing the food order] Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person. [gets the money and shows it to Timmy] Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something."
485,7,2,Mr Kim,"Here! Here two order of Kung Pao Chicken, and small ice tea!"
486,7,2,Jimmy,"Actually, it was a regular lemonade."
487,7,2,Mr Kim,"[mortified at his error] AAAAAGH-agh!! [bows] I sorry! I sorry! I no want no trouble. [reaches for a cup and prepares a regular lemonade] Here. Remonade. [sets it on the counter. Jimmy reaches for it] Now go, just go!"
488,7,2,Jimmy,"Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time."
489,7,2,Timmy,[smiles] Timmih!
490,7,2,Mr Kim,[soon lowers his arms and places a call] Hello! Police? I've just been robbed by two gang members!
491,7,2,Pops,"Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come into the kitchen please?"
492,7,2,Jimmy,"[enters] Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops?"
493,7,2,Pops,"Uh have a seat, Jim. Your mother and I need to talk to you. [Jimmy approaches a chair and struggles to climb up on it. He gets no help from his parents. He succeeds in climbing the chair, then in sitting upright. He settles down.] Son, your mother and I have noticed a change in your behavior. And... we're worried that you might be involved in a gang."
494,7,2,Jimmy,"A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg."
495,7,2,Mamsie,"Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true! [buries her face in Ryan's chest and sobs uncontrollably]"
496,7,2,Jimmy,"Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean [enunciates the nest two words] come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much."
497,7,2,Ryan and Sarah Swanson,"Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good."
498,7,2,Jimmy,"Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends."
499,7,2,Mamsie,"And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too?"
500,7,2,Jimmy,[now naturally] Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!
501,7,2,Ryan and Sarah Swanson,"Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!"
502,7,2,Jimmy,Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
503,7,2,Ryan and Sarah Swanson,"That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son."
504,7,2,Jimmy,"Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left. [hops off the chair and ambles off. His mom sobs again. Ryan holds her]"
505,7,2,Christopher Reeve,Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.
506,7,2,Aide,"[rushes in with a fresh delivery] Here's the new shipment, sir. [Reeve lunges for the box and rips it out of the aide's hands, pushing the aide away] Hey! [Reeve tears into the box, opens the cooler, grabs a fetus, and starts sucking its juices out. A few seconds later, a door at the far wall opens]"
507,7,2,Man,"Hello there, Christopher. [Reeve is upset that he's been disturbed, but turns around and turns pleasant]"
508,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?"
509,7,2,Gene Hackman,I'm good. You?
510,7,2,Christopher Reeve,I am better with each passing day. [turns around and pulls out another fetus] Stronger and more agile. [sucks its juices out as Hackman looks on]
511,7,2,Gene Hackman,"Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?"
512,7,2,Christopher Reeve,[with fetus still on his lips] What?
513,7,2,Gene Hackman,Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone.
514,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?"
515,7,2,Gene Hackman,"I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher."
516,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"[raises his arms in a fit of rage, then turns away] Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am... [looks back menacingly] Chris!"
517,7,2,Jimmy,"Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- [outside, a car rolls up to the house slowly. Four Bloods look at the house, all of them with masks on]"
518,7,2,Blood,"[front passenger side] Payback time, mothafucka! [the Bloods starts spraying the house with bullets]"
519,7,2,Jimmy,"[looks around as the bullets tear up the windows] Jesus Christ! [dives to the floor and crawls to the other side of the table, then rises up.] Holy G...guacamole! [the bullets start tearing up the couch and the front door. Jimmy dives to the floor, then rises up a few seconds later.] Freakin' Frijoles! [dives to the floor again. The front door is gone and the couch's stuffing is all over the place. Its springs pop out. The right-side portrait next to the door falls. The bullets stop, and Jimmy rises once again] Leapin' L-langosta. [the left-side portrait falls]"
520,7,2,Blood,"East Side Bloods! [the Bloods drop back into their car and peel off. Some time later, Officer Barbrady and his men show up to take reports and check out the crime scene. Timmy has returned to be with Jimmy. Two people walk up to the Swansons]"
521,7,2,Detectives Hyde and Richardson,We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson from the Special Gang unit in Denver.
522,7,2,Jimmy,"Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?"
523,7,2,Detectives Hyde and Richardson,Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.
524,7,2,Jimmy,The... B-Bloods?
525,7,2,Detectives Hyde and Richardson,"You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time!"
526,7,2,Jimmy,The-they do??
527,7,2,Detectives Hyde and Richardson,"Don't act like you don't know, you lil' punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too."
528,7,2,Jimmy,But... but why do they hate each other?
529,7,2,Detectives Hyde and Richardson,"Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!"
530,7,2,Jimmy,"Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?"
531,7,2,Detectives Hyde and Richardson,[realizes this conversation is fruitless] Come on. The only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed. [the detectives leave. Jim's mom begins to sob and then runs into the house.]
532,7,2,Ryan and Sarah Swanson,[follows her in] Sarah!
533,7,2,Jimmy,"[begins to pace before Timmy] Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong."
534,7,2,Timmy,[agreeing] Tim-mih.
535,7,2,Jimmy,"Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to s-stop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk."
536,7,2,Timmy,Timmih!!
537,7,2,Jimmy,"You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there."
538,7,2,Timmy,Timmih!!
539,7,2,Jimmy,This is gonna be t-terrific!
540,7,2,Reporter,"[same as before] Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head. [Christopher walks over to a green truck and lifts the front end up over his head. The crowd oohs and claps for him]"
541,7,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, what a fighter."
542,7,2,Gerald Broflovski,"That brave, brave man."
543,7,2,Liane Cartman,He's an inspiration to us all.
544,7,2,Reporter,"Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength."
545,7,2,Gene Hackman,"[appears with a crowd of people] Chris, that's enough!"
546,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"[looks at Hackman and drops the truck] Hello, Gene! So good to see you!"
547,7,2,Gene Hackman,"You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells."
548,7,2,Christopher Reeve,Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!
549,7,2,Reporter,"Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't know what is."
550,7,2,Gene Hackman,"They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!"
551,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!! [reaches over, picks up the truck clear over his head, and throws it at Hackman. Hackman and his crowd jump clear of the truck's path, screaming. The truck lands upside down where the crown stood. Reeve then runs down the street and onto a car] You won't stop me, Hack Man! [runs off the truck and jumps away maniacally] Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa! [jumps higher and higher until he clears buildings with each jump] Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!"
552,7,2,Reporter,"Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now."
553,7,2,Jimmy,"Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside. [the last of the guests enter] Great to see you all. What a terrific audience."
554,7,2,Janitor,"[an elderly man soon exits] Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?"
555,7,2,Jimmy,"We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by."
556,7,2,Mr Appleby,Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area.
557,7,2,Jimmy,You bet. [he and Timmy move around him and into the center]
558,7,2,Mr Appleby,I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time.
559,7,2,Jimmy,"Oh, we will. [Mr. Appleby closes the door and locks it.]"
560,7,2,Buff Crip,The Bloods!
561,7,2,Blood 1,Oh shit! It's a trap!
562,7,2,Blood 2,Muthafuckin Crips tryin' to smoke us all out!
563,7,2,Crip,What the hell is goin' on here? [Jimmy and Timmy step into the middle ground between the two gangs]
564,7,2,Jimmy,"It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles."
565,7,2,Timmy,Timmih!
566,7,2,Jimmy,"But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along. [immediately, both sides draw weapons and aim them at each other. Once all the weapons are out...] Theeerrre's pizzaaa."
567,7,2,Reporter,"Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom! [Its headquarters now appears behind him] The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom."
568,7,2,Christopher Reeve,"I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery, [Osama bin Laden and Dr. Doom are shown, then Blank Manta and Saddam Hussein] Their desire for world conquest, [Cheetah, Kim Jong-il, and David Blaine are shown] and their hatred of all things good! [Professor Chaos is shown] And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to... [the picture behind him changes from a fist smashing Earth to a picture of Gene Hackman] get rid of Hack Man!! [laughs maniacally for effect, but no other villain moves]"
569,7,2,Dr Doom,"Uhhh, how about domination of the world?"
570,7,2,Saddam Hussein,"Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?"
571,7,2,Christopher Reeve,Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.
572,7,2,Professor Chaos,"Oh boy, General Disarray, may- maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one."
573,7,2,Gene Hackman,"[bursts through the doors with his supporters] Not so fast, Chris!"
574,7,2,Christopher Reeve,[sucking on yet another fetus] Hack Man!
575,7,2,Gene Hackman,We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!
576,7,2,Christopher Reeve,No... [grabs his head in frustration] NOOOO!
577,7,2,Gene Hackman,And now we're going to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again!
578,7,2,Buff Crip,You stupid mofos are dead!
579,7,2,Blood 3,"Make the first shot, punk!"
580,7,2,Jimmy,"Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers."
581,7,2,Blood 4,"Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers! [the atmosphere grows tense]"
582,7,2,Jimmy,"Look, we have the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?"
583,7,2,58 Crip,"You talkin' crazy, dawg."
584,7,2,Blood 5,"Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!"
585,7,2,Jimmy,"Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean, [enunciates] Come on! [several tense seconds pass]"
586,7,2,Buff Crip,Wait a minute. What did you say?
587,7,2,Jimmy,"I said, ""I mean, [enunciates] Come on!"""
588,7,2,Blood 4,"You know, maybe he's right. I mean, [enunciates] Come on!"
589,7,2,Jimmy,[enunciates] Come on.
590,7,2,Buff Crip,I guess we could at least give havin' fun together a try. It's like [enunciates] Come on.
591,7,2,Blood 6,Yeah. Come on.
592,7,2,Crip 2,"Yeah, that's right. Come on."
593,7,2,Jimmy,Come on.
594,7,2,Someone,Come on.
595,7,2,All,"[in agreement] Yeah, that's right. Come on. [moments later rap music is playing, gang members gather in the pool and one prepares for a dive. In the gym gang members play basketball without arguing. One of them dances along the foul line. In another room gang members play pool. The camera stops at Jimmy and three members - two Crips and one Blood]"
596,7,2,Buff Crip,I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.
597,7,2,Jimmy,"I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger."
598,7,2,Blood,Right on!
599,7,2,Crip,"[walks up to Timmy] Hey little roller, try some of this chronic shit."
600,7,2,Timmy,Timmih! [takes a hit. Both Crips and Bloods laugh]
601,7,2,Jimmy,"I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'. [a song begins, and Jimmy approaches the camera] The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?"
602,7,3,Teacher,"[walks through the class] Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to feel the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice. Uh huh. [the boys still laugh at their monument]"
603,7,3,Eric Cartman,[laughing] Put more clay on the balls.
604,7,3,Teacher,[noticing] Boys! [they stop laughing as she points] What is that?
605,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,A reindeer?
606,7,3,Teacher,"You know, I've had it! You four boys never take art class seriously!"
607,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[retorts] What a crime. [the three others chuckle, then laugh out loud]"
608,7,3,Teacher,"[displeased, with arms crossed] You think art is not important?"
609,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads."
610,7,3,Butters Stotch,[pipes up] I love art class!
611,7,3,Stan Marsh,See?
612,7,3,Teacher,"[reaches for their creation and grabs it by the shaft] Do you think this is funny?! [shakes it around for effect] Do you think this is funny, huh?! [ends up looking at the head, as if she's about to suck on it. The boys cover their mouths to hold their laughter, knowing how she looks with their creation like that, but soon they burst out laughing. The teacher now cradles the project] Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery! [the laughter stops and the boys' jaws drop.]"
613,7,3,Eric Cartman,You can't do that!
614,7,3,Teacher,I certainly can! I'm your teacher!
615,7,3,Eric Cartman,You're an art teacher!
616,7,3,Teacher,Make it two hours!
617,7,3,Stan Marsh,Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool!
618,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,How dare she talk to us like that?!
619,7,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)"
620,7,3,Eric Cartman,We can't let her get away with this! [voicing dropping to almost a whisper] I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
621,7,3,Stan Marsh,Like what?
622,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house."
623,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
624,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,TP her house?
625,7,3,Eric Cartman,Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
626,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh.
627,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[sensing Kyle's reluctance] What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken? [begins strutting like a chicken and making chicken noises. Kyle kicks Cartman in the balls in anger] Ugh! [drops to his knees, then gets one leg up]"
628,7,3,Teacher,"Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished!"
629,7,3,Stan Marsh,"[glares back at her, then softly] Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!"
630,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[in pain] Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!"
631,7,3,Stan Marsh,D'you think that's enough?
632,7,3,Eric Cartman,Should be fine.
633,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
634,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay. [reaches behind the other boys and grabs something] Here we go, pack of chewing gum. [tosses it into the first cart. They approach the cash register]"
635,7,3,Cashier,Hello boys. Find everything you need?
636,7,3,Eric Cartman,Yep. All set.
637,7,3,Cashier,"[begins scanning the packages] Mkay', let's see here. Toilet paper [""beep"" $1.50 for a four-pack] Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] So, what are you kids up to tonight? [""beep""]"
638,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game."
639,7,3,Cashier,"Nice relaxing night at home, huh? Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] Aaand toilet paper [""beep."" He picks up the gum] Eh, hey. [holds up the gum] Now you kids be careful with this chewing gum. Don't go sticking it under tables."
640,7,3,Stan Marsh,Okay
641,7,3,Cashier,"Okay. Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep.""] You know, son, I remember you comin' in last week and buying this much toilet paper. [""beep""]"
642,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Heh yeah, that that's right."
643,7,3,Cashier,"... Toilet paper [""beep""] Toilet paper [""beep""]"
644,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?"
645,7,3,Eric Cartman,No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
646,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. [flashes disgust] Uuugh.
647,7,3,Stan Marsh,Is this the right house?
648,7,3,Eric Cartman,"It's the right address-wait! Look there! [the teacher prepares the dining-room table] There's Mrs. Streibel! This is the place. [loosens the drawstring on his back and lets the sides fall away. In the dining room, a boy and girl arrive and sit at table]"
649,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside."
650,7,3,Eric Cartman,So?
651,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
652,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, we all agreed to do this!"
653,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!"
654,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, you're being an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah. [takes out a roll and advances a bit] Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! [unleashes the first roll]"
655,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah! Fuck you!)
656,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on, let's go! [he and Kenny cross the road and drop down to a ditch on the other side. Stan follows]"
657,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,What have we done? [Stan looks back and gets Kyle]
658,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Let's go, Kyle! [drags him off. Kyle is transfixed for a bit, then turns to follow Stan. A last shot of the house, and then the boys reach their bus stop gasping for air.]"
659,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble."
660,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, that was sooo awesome! [smiles]"
661,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
662,7,3,Eric Cartman,Who cares??
663,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!"
664,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Me?? [takes a couple steps forward] There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. [Kyle blanches]"
665,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together."
666,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]"
667,7,3,Mrs Streibel,AAAAAAAAA!
668,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!"
669,7,3,The Streibel Girls,[crying] Mommy! Mommy!
670,7,3,Mr Streibel,[with her family around her] Whyyy? Whyyy?
671,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[wakes up, startled] Ah! Oh God! Oh God!"
672,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streibel's house got covered with toilet paper."
673,7,3,Clyde Donovan,Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
674,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her."
675,7,3,Butters Stotch,I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
676,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. [the bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with some books.]"
677,7,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now."
678,7,3,Eric Cartman,[snaps his fingers] Damn!
679,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God!
680,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
681,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine."
682,7,3,Stan Marsh,We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
683,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46."
684,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality
685,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Yes, dude!"
686,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??"
687,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, Ah I, ah I thought..."
688,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[exasperated] Oh, for Christ's sake!"
689,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody."
690,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Stan. [the doorknow begins to turn] Sh sh, here they come, here they come. [the door opens and Mr. Mackey appears] ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?"
691,7,3,Mr Mackey,"We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?"
692,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(Me??)
693,7,3,Mr Mackey,"Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k? [Kenny hops off and enters the office, and Mr. Mackey closes the door. The other boys' jaws drop a bit.]"
694,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй."
695,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Why are they doing us one at a time?
696,7,3,Eric Cartman,"They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal."
697,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,[brightens up] I can get a better deal?
698,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!"
699,7,3,Mr Streibel,"There we go. That should be about the last of it. [Officer Barbrady passes by with police tape, stretching it out from tree to tree. The camera pulls back to show the house is also covered in police tape] Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?"
700,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Crime scene investigation! [pulls out a small tape recorder and starts speaking into it] There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? [turns it off]
701,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this."
702,7,3,Officer Barbrady,[noticing the trash bags] Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
703,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Look it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid."
704,7,3,Officer Barbrady,You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
705,7,3,Mr Streibel,I was here.
706,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Aha!! Got you!
707,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Officer, why would I TP my own house?"
708,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Insurance?
709,7,3,Mr Streibel,"It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal."
710,7,3,Officer Barbrady,[grabs him by the collar] Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
711,7,3,Mr Streibel,"You really have nothing better to do, do you?"
712,7,3,Officer Barbrady,No I do not.
713,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]"
714,7,3,Mrs Streibel,AAAAAAAAA!
715,7,3,Mr Streibel,"Oh, Jesus no! Our house!"
716,7,3,The Streibel Girls,[crying] Mommy! Mommy!
717,7,3,Nancy Kerrigan (in nightmare),[being treated on the ice rink] Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?
718,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[wakes up, startled] Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth! [hops off the bed and runs to the bedroom door] Mooooomm! [opens the door and finds Cartman in the hallway]"
719,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[in rave tones] Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?"
720,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
721,7,3,Eric Cartman,No need. I have one for you right here. [presents a glass of water to him]
722,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,[takes the glass] Oh. Okay. Thanks.
723,7,3,Eric Cartman,Is there anything else I can get for you?
724,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now."
725,7,3,Eric Cartman,"You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. [closes the door]"
726,7,3,Prison Warden,Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year. [fumbles for his keys.] He's a real monster.
727,7,3,Officer Barbrady,I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think.
728,7,3,Prison Warden,Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance. [finally opens the door] He's the last cell on your left. [Barbrady enters and finds himself in an old part of the Hall. He walks past the prisoners and arrives at Josh's cell. It is a brick cell with a thick glass wall where prison bars would normally be. Holes in the glass allow for conversation. Josh has paintings of toilet paper around the cell.]
729,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police."
730,7,3,Josh,"[affecting a Hopkins accent] That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual."
731,7,3,Officer Barbrady,I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
732,7,3,Josh,And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?
733,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?"
734,7,3,Josh,[turns away] Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.
735,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh."
736,7,3,Josh,"[turns back] No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it? [a closeup of Josh's face] Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?"
737,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"[reflecting] Well, that's kind of personal."
738,7,3,Josh,"[extreme closeup] Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house."
739,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know."
740,7,3,Josh,"Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them. [approaches the drop slot as Barbrady slides the packet of photos in, then walks back and takes them out for review.] Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is."
741,7,3,Officer Barbrady,So you think there was more than one. Why?
742,7,3,Josh,"[puts the photos behind his back] Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?"
743,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! [cries uncontrollably]"
744,7,3,Josh,"[closes his eyes, satisfied.] Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man."
745,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second? [Stan waves bye to Clyde, Craig, and Kevin, and they leave. He and Kenny approach Cartman talks in hushed tones] I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle."
746,7,3,Stan Marsh,What about him?
747,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack."
748,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(I think so too.)
749,7,3,Eric Cartman,Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
750,7,3,Butters Stotch,[walks up] Ha-ey fellas. [Cartman and Kenny avoid eye contact with Butters]
751,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Butters. [looks down, then away, then sniffs, then clears his throat. After a while, Butters just walks off]"
752,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[a few seconds later] Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!"
753,7,3,Stan Marsh,So what should we do?
754,7,3,Eric Cartman,We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
755,7,3,Stan Marsh,"[just looks at Cartman] ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!"
756,7,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
757,7,3,Eric Cartman,Why not?
758,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?"
759,7,3,Eric Cartman,"He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. [walks off]"
760,7,3,Cashier,"You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?"
761,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene. [walks up to a body bag] I'm... sorry I have to do this. [unzips the bag and recoils with Bell at the apparent foul odor. They both cough]"
762,7,3,Mr Bell,Oh my God.
763,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Is this toilet paper from your store?
764,7,3,Mr Bell,"It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now."
765,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"[takes out the tape recorder, turns it on, and speaks into it] Positive ID on the toilet paper. [turns it off and puts it away]"
766,7,3,Mr Bell,Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who?
767,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?"
768,7,3,Mr Bell,Suspicious like how?
769,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern."
770,7,3,Mr Bell,"Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store. [arrives at a realization] Oh my God! [vomits]"
771,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What's this all about, Cartman?"
772,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?"
773,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,A boat ride?
774,7,3,Eric Cartman,I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
775,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, okay."
776,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat? [Kyle walks over and helps Cartman load the block and chain onto the boat. Kyle then hops in. Cartman retrieves a bat, loads it onto the boat, and hops in. The boat begins to float away from the shore.] Okay, let's go. [starts to row. The boat heads for the middle of the pond, and eerie music plays] So how are things, Kyle?"
777,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
778,7,3,Eric Cartman,And you feel like you have to confess.
779,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know what to do. [Cartman reaches for the bat while Kyle has his back to him] Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now. [Cartman takes aim] Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before. [Cartman moves the bat around, measuring Kyle] So cold. The world can feel like that. [Cartman moves forward, ready to whack him] So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens. [Cartman takes a whack at Kyle's head, but all Kyle does is blink] Ow. [rubs his head and turns around] What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!"
780,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. [whacks him again]"
781,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
782,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. [whacks him twice more]"
783,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You wanna kill me?! Fine! [turns around and crosses his arms] I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! [Cartman lowers the bat and thinks a bit, then resumes whacking Kyle. Once. Then eight more times.]"
784,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Won't be long, Kyle. [whacks him three more times.]"
785,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh, I need your help."
786,7,3,Josh,"The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it."
787,7,3,Officer Barbrady,How do you mean?
788,7,3,Josh,"Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?"
789,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Yes.
790,7,3,Josh,Single-sheet?
791,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"No, two-ply. [Josh closes his eyes and thinks hard] What? What does that tell you?"
792,7,3,Josh,Why does one toilet-paper houses
793,7,3,Officer Barbrady,To get revenge.
794,7,3,Josh,"No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation."
795,7,3,Officer Barbrady,What do you mean?
796,7,3,Josh,"Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?"
797,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"I don't have time for this, kid."
798,7,3,Josh,Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool house?
799,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! [cries uncontrollably]
800,7,3,Josh,"Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art."
801,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Oh. Of course! One of her students!
802,7,3,Josh,"Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make. [turns around and whispers to himself] Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy."
803,7,3,Prison Warden,"[arrives at Josh's cell] Josh, [the smile vanishes from Josh's face] were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?"
804,7,3,Josh,"[normal voice] No, sir."
805,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, what are you doing?"
806,7,3,Eric Cartman,I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
807,7,3,Stan Marsh,"You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!"
808,7,3,Eric Cartman,They did?
809,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,They did?
810,7,3,Stan Marsh,They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
811,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
812,7,3,Eric Cartman,But can I still kill Kyyyle?
813,7,3,South Park Police Department,Dialog
814,7,3,day The boys head for the station and enter,Dialog
815,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Hello boys. How are you?
816,7,3,Stan Marsh,We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
817,7,3,Officer Barbrady,It sure is!
818,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh, can we see them-him-her?"
819,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Right over here. [takes the boys over to the one jail cell] Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. [the boys turn right to see the suspect]"
820,7,3,Butters Stotch,Hey fellas!
821,7,3,Stan Marsh,Butters?
822,7,3,Butters Stotch,Yep. I'm in jail.
823,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,You con-fessed?
824,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house. [thoughtful] I don't seem to remember it, [normal] but they're pretty sure it was me. [approaches the bars and grabs them] I just can't get my behavior under control!"
825,7,3,Officer Barbrady,His parents are on their way down now.
826,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!"
827,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away, and the other boys huddle around him] You guys, we can't let him do this!"
828,7,3,Eric Cartman,What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
829,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!"
830,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house."
831,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Why do you say that?
832,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Because it was-
833,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up and intervenes] Wiffle ball, anyone? [glares at Kyle] Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?"
834,7,3,Butters Stotch,"You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too."
835,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by."
836,7,3,Eric Cartman,"You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?"
837,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I still feel bad, Cartman"
838,7,3,Eric Cartman,What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
839,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. That makes it even worse.
840,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever."
841,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,I know.
842,7,3,Eric Cartman,"So... so then, how can you feel bad?"
843,7,3,Stan Marsh,He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
844,7,3,Eric Cartman,...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
845,7,3,Stan Marsh,"It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad. [to Kyle] I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess."
846,7,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, maybe we should.)"
847,7,3,Eric Cartman,"What?? Eh... [tries to be upbeat] hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!"
848,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,We feel bad for other people.
849,7,3,Eric Cartman,"[looks at the other boys in disbelief] For oth-er... [winces] Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?"
850,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do. [points an accusing finger at Cartman] And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! [He, Kyle, and Kenny leave]"
851,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!"
852,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! [approaches the jail cell]
853,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Hi, Dad."
854,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Don't you ""Hi, Dad"" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!"
855,7,3,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
856,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!"
857,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Huh??
858,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady."
859,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!"
860,7,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol."
861,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,And that's your excuse?!
862,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. [goes to the cell door and opens it]"
863,7,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!"
864,7,3,Butters Stotch,"[steps back from the door] Officer, can I stay in jail, please?"
865,7,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you guys! Hurry! [steps forward and looks back to his friends] Guys, hurry!"
866,7,3,Stan Marsh,"[appears] What is it, Cartman? [Kyle and Kenny trail Stan]"
867,7,3,Eric Cartman,It's over this way! Come on!
868,7,3,Eric Cartman,"So how are things, guys?"
869,7,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final."
870,7,3,Eric Cartman,I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
871,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!"
872,7,3,Eric Cartman,Can't I? [pulls out the Wiffle ball bat and starts whacking the other three. They just look at each other.]
873,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Excuse me, everyone. [Mr. Mackey and Mrs. Streibel turn around. Principal Victoria sits at her desk] I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house! [the door opens and Josh is rolled in tied up to a dolly by a policeman. He quickly looks to his left] Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. [on top of a file cabinet near the door is a roll of toilet paper. Josh smiles]"
874,7,3,Mr Mackey,"Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-"
875,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[rushes in] Hold it! [Stan and Kenny rush in behind him] Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streibel. We have something we need to tell you."
876,7,3,Principal Victoria,"All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?"
877,7,3,Josh,"What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?"
878,7,3,Principal Victoria,[pointing] Get him out of here!
879,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?"
880,7,3,Josh,"[being rolled out] Ooh, Policeman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Policeman Brown? [the roll of toilet paper is now gone...]"
881,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,We have to confess that we were the ones that-
882,7,3,Mr Mackey,"It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything."
883,7,3,Stan Marsh,"You, you do? How?"
884,7,3,Eric Cartman,[steps forward from the back of the room] Hi guys.
885,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman??
886,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I told them everything, you guys. It's over."
887,7,3,Principal Victoria,"Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward."
888,7,3,Eric Cartman,My consciences just caught up with me.
889,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,That's not fair!
890,7,3,Mr Mackey,"You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave."
891,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!"
892,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. [turns and exits the room]"
893,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
894,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, Josh, time to go back to the... [sees Policeman Brown covered in toilet paper and Josh's dolly empty] Oh no!"
895,7,3,Policeman Brown,He... He was too fast for me. He ran out the door!
896,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Couldn't you have gone after him?
897,7,3,Policeman Brown,"Well, ah I'm covered in toilet paper. I'd look silly."
898,7,3,Mr Mackey,"Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?"
899,7,3,Stan Marsh,Wugh! Two weeks of this!
900,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now."
901,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later."
902,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh Jesus! [buries his face in his hands, then raises it as Cartman talks]"
903,7,3,Eric Cartman,"I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible."
904,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
905,7,3,Eric Cartman,Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
906,7,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!"
907,7,3,Eric Cartman,Hm.
908,7,3,Officer Barbrady,Police station.
909,7,3,Josh,[over the earpiece] Hello Officer Barbrady.
910,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh? Josh, where are you?!"
911,7,3,Josh,"I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell."
912,7,3,Officer Barbrady,"Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence."
913,7,3,Josh,"Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao. [hangs up. Next to him are two boxes full of toilet paper. He picks them up and leaves the phone. The camera zooms out to reveal the location to be a park across the street from the White House. Josh heads for the White House, but stops at the curb to gaze at it.]"
914,7,4,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?"
915,7,4,Mr Slave,[at his own little desk off to the side] All donesy wunsy. [has a clipboard to prove it]
916,7,4,Mr Garrison,"Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problem."
917,7,4,Cartman,"[searching his notebook] Math homework, Math homework. Where did I file that?"
918,7,4,Mr Garrison,"[about to write on the board, but turns around] Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. [the kids quickly stare at each other]"
919,7,4,The Boys,We got out of schoo-l! No more school toda-ay!
920,7,4,Kyle,What should we do?
921,7,4,Stan,"Let's go see a movie! [they stop in their tracks as they hear ""No war! No war!""]"
922,7,4,Protesters,No war! No war! [a sea of them mill around on South Park Avenue waving various signs around] No war! No war! [One man wields an American flag. He lowers it while another reaches for a lighter and set the flag aflame.] No war! No war! [three men break into Tele's through its large window and steal various TVs] No war! No war! No war!
923,7,4,Mr Mackey,"[walks up to the boys with several signs in his hands] No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh uh, here you go, boys. [hands each of them a sign] These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?!"
924,7,4,A voice,"Excuse me, boys. [the boys look and the adult is shown] Tom Stansel, HBC news. Can you kids tell me why you marched out of school today? [behind him is the cameraman and an assistant, and behind her, the news van]"
925,7,4,Stan,[pause] Uh... war?
926,7,4,Reporter Tom Stansel,Right. What about the war?
927,7,4,Kyle,[pause] Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
928,7,4,Reporter Tom Stansel,"Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay?"
929,7,4,Kyle,"[looks at his sign] Uuuh, n-no blood for oil."
930,7,4,Stan,Yeah. [the mic moves back to him as he looks at his sign] War is not my voice.
931,7,4,Cartman,[reading Kenny's sign] Bush is a Naizi
932,7,4,Skeeter,"[arrives with a crowd] Hey all you un-American bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! [moves his right thumb in front of his shoulder and to his right. With him are Jimbo, Ned, Stuart, and Craig's father Tom]"
933,7,4,Mr Mackey,Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?
934,7,4,Protesters,Yeah! Right!
935,7,4,Stuart McCormick,"If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!"
936,7,4,War Pretesters and Supporters,Yeah! Right!
937,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
938,7,4,Skeeter,Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses!
939,7,4,Reporter Tom Stansel,"Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say?"
940,7,4,Cartman,"...Eh the... Founding who? [seconds later, both sides rush each other and attack]"
941,7,4,Mr Garrison,"[drops his arm, putting his right hand on his hip] Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves! [crosses his arms again] Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!"
942,7,4,Butters,"Mmuh well, not really, no."
943,7,4,Mr Garrison,"Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!"
944,7,4,Class,Awwwwww!
945,7,4,Mr Garrison,"SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! [walks off]"
946,7,4,Cartman,"[beginning to slack off] Ugh. Ughuh. [tries to resume studying, but his eyes grow heavy. He panics] I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! [yawns loudly and promptly sleeps on his book]"
947,7,4,Kyle,"[smacks Cartman] Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!"
948,7,4,Cartman,But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
949,7,4,Stan,[pointing] You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
950,7,4,Cartman,Maaaa. M-maaaa.
951,7,4,Kyle,Shut up and study!
952,7,4,Cartman,"Maaaa. Mah mah mh. [reluctantly returns to reading. He begins to fidget, then reads more, then fidgets again, turns the page, fidgets once more, then just thinks] Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days? [repeats the question, his voice fading at each repetition] In those days? In those days? In those days?"
953,7,4,Kyle,[noticing] What are you doing?
954,7,4,Cartman,I'm trying to have a flashback.
955,7,4,Kenny,(A what?)
956,7,4,Cartman,"You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!"
957,7,4,Stan,"No, you just have to study."
958,7,4,Cartman,"No. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second. [thinks] Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then? [repeats the last two words, his voice fading at each repetition] Back then? Back then? Back then? [nothing happens. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at him] Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me. [his voice begins to fade and he begins moving his hands around like a pantomime. The camera closes in] With me. With... anything to do with me. With me."
959,7,4,Kyle,"That isn't gonna work, dumbass!"
960,7,4,Mr Slave,"Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me."
961,7,4,Stan,"[from behind his book] Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!"
962,7,4,Cartman,"[throws a fit] Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!"
963,7,4,Skeeter,"There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. [the war supporters begin to clamor]"
964,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!"
965,7,4,Protesters,"Hahahaha, yeah."
966,7,4,Jimbo,You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side of the town!
967,7,4,Protester,"Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office."
968,7,4,Stuart McCormick,Well your side has the grocery store.
969,7,4,Jimbo,Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
970,7,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?"
971,7,4,Jimbo,"W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs."
972,7,4,Townsfolk,"Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh."
973,7,4,Skeeter,"Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were."
974,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"He's right. [looks at Sheila] Boy, do I feel like a fool. [moments later, both sides attack each other again. Among the skirmishes: Kenny's mom attacks Gerald, Sheila attacks Ned]"
975,7,4,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're supposed to be studying! [the boys stop at the entrance to Cartman's room]"
976,7,4,Cartman,That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. [tests the tautness of the string]
977,7,4,Stan,How?!
978,7,4,Cartman,"All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!"
979,7,4,Kyle,"Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!"
980,7,4,Cartman,"Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Kenny looks at them. They clear the doorway. Kyle stands on one side, Stan and Kenny on the other. Cartman backs up, clears his throat, then begins to walk with purpose] Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. [trips the string. The rock immediately falls on his head, knocking him out. He moans a few times.]"
981,7,4,Kyle,Cartman? Cartman?? [the boys gather around Cartman. Kyle turns him over.]
982,7,4,Cartman,Benjamin Franklin?
983,7,4,Kyle,"No, turdpants, it's Kyle!"
984,7,4,Cartman,"[touches Kyle, then in a weak raspy voice] Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!"
985,7,4,Townsfolk,Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
986,7,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay, people. What are we rambling about now?"
987,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[steps forward] Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square."
988,7,4,Skeeter,"[steps forward, past a few war supporters] That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!"
989,7,4,Gerald Broflovski,There was no war months ago!
990,7,4,Skeeter,"Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!"
991,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music propaganda!"
992,7,4,Stuart McCormick,Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! [both side begin to clamor again]
993,7,4,Mr Mackey,"Well up yours, rednecks!"
994,7,4,Townsfolk,Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
995,7,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups."
996,7,4,Jimbo,"All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!"
997,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!"
998,7,4,Skeeter,We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!
999,7,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!"
1000,7,4,Stan,Cartman?
1001,7,4,Kyle,"Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! [there's debris all over the living room. The boys arrive at Cartman hanging from a candy-cane colored swing set with the swings removed. Beneath him is a tub of water. Cartman has it rigged so that he pulls a string, which releases him and at the same time triggers a sledgehammer, which hits a box, which is supposed to land in the tub with him.]"
1002,7,4,Cartman,"Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time."
1003,7,4,Stan,Oh no...
1004,7,4,Cartman,Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers!
1005,7,4,Kyle,"Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!"
1006,7,4,Cartman,"I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!"
1007,7,4,Stan,"Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea."
1008,7,4,Cartman,Or a really sweet one. [a bell is heard]
1009,7,4,TV OH,Your Tivo is full.
1010,7,4,Cartman,"Whoa, here it goes! [triggers the sledgehammer as he falls. Both he and the TiVo land in the tub, and the house shorts out. Cartman is electrocuted as he lands in the water. The boys spend a few seconds in the darkness looking at Cartman, wondering if he'll come to. Kenny turns and walks away slowly]"
1011,7,4,Kyle,Cartman? [no response] Cartman??
1012,7,4,Stan,Aww crap.
1013,7,4,Cartman,"Ohhh awesome!!! [a horse-drawn carriage approaches, driven by a teenage boy.]"
1014,7,4,Driver / Official Messenger Boy,"Worthy young lad, are you all right?"
1015,7,4,Cartman,Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
1016,7,4,Driver / Official Messenger Boy,"This year? Why it's 1776, it is."
1017,7,4,Cartman,Oho yes! I did it I did it!
1018,7,4,Driver / Official Messenger Boy,"Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's house to get a very important document, I am."
1019,7,4,Cartman,"Oho kick fucking ass, dude! [approaches the carriage and climbs up to sit alongside the driver]"
1020,7,4,Driver / Official Messenger Boy,"Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?"
1021,7,4,Cartman,"No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback."
1022,7,4,Driver / Official Messenger Boy,"A flashback? Why, what is that?"
1023,7,4,Cartman,"Well you know, it's a... [points at something] H-ho, awesome! [they've entered the town and Cartman begins to sing.]

Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.
With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.
What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me
I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.
Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle."
1024,7,4,Liane Cartman,"[jumps up worried] Is he going to be all right, doctor??"
1025,7,4,Dr Doctor,Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.
1026,7,4,Liane Cartman,"[quickly returns to embrace him, with emotion in her voice.] Oh baby baby, you can't die."
1027,7,4,Kyle,"Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! [shakes him hard]"
1028,7,4,Liane Cartman,"Whoa. Easy, Kyle."
1029,7,4,Kyle,"But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!"
1030,7,4,Stan,"I guess we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!"
1031,7,4,Liane Cartman,"I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!"
1032,7,4,Driver / Official Messenger Boy,"Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson."
1033,7,4,Cartman,Super neato! [both driver and Cartman disboard and walk towards the door]
1034,7,4,Driver / Official Messenger Boy,[stops and turns] I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.
1035,7,4,Cartman,"But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report."
1036,7,4,Driver / Official Messenger Boy,Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
1037,7,4,Cartman,"Oh, okay.I guess I understand. [the driver walks off. Cartman notices some firewood and picks up a log of it, then follows the driver while singing to himself]

I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...[he quickly assaults the driver and beats him with the log, then drags the body away and returns to the Jefferson residence, knocking on the door]
I don't wanna wait for our life to be over..."
1038,7,4,Thomas Jefferson,Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.
1039,7,4,Cartman,"And I am the official messenger boy, I am."
1040,7,4,Thomas Jefferson,[holding a document] Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress. [hands it to Cartman]
1041,7,4,Cartman,"[beholding it] Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day."
1042,7,4,Thomas Jefferson,Some favor going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.
1043,7,4,Cartman,"It's a bitch, ain't it?"
1044,7,4,Thomas Jefferson,"Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger! [Cartman turns and heads for the carriage] Now make haste!"
1045,7,4,Stan,"Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-"
1046,7,4,Protesters,"[first heard, then seen as they enter from screen left] No war! No war! No war!"
1047,7,4,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus..."
1048,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song."
1049,7,4,Stan,"Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war."
1050,7,4,Mr Mackey,Hey... That's a terrific idea!
1051,7,4,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
1052,7,4,Stan,"Oh, no, nononono."
1053,7,4,War Pretesters and Supporters,"[first heard, then they enter through the front door] Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops!"
1054,7,4,Skeeter,See? I told you they had your son.
1055,7,4,Stuart McCormick,Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!
1056,7,4,Kenny,(I'm doing my homework.)
1057,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! [the war supporters clamor against Randy]
1058,7,4,Stan,"Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-"
1059,7,4,Stuart McCormick,"Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country! [grabs Kenny's jacket] Come on, Kenny!"
1060,7,4,Kenny,"(But Dad, I-)"
1061,7,4,Stuart McCormick,NOW!
1062,7,4,Skeeter,Yeah!
1063,7,4,War Pretesters and Supporters,Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! [they walk out the front door. Kenny follows his dad out. Stan follows him ]
1064,7,4,Stan,"[stops at the open door] Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww. [turns around and returns to the table] Awww, now we lost two in our study group!"
1065,7,4,Kyle,[shoves his book off the table] God damnit!
1066,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
1067,7,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!"
1068,7,4,Protester 1,"Yeah, that's right!"
1069,7,4,Protester 2,"Come on, guys!"
1070,7,4,Protester 3,Get back to work!
1071,7,4,Kyle,Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
1072,7,4,A voice,"Enter, young messenger. [Cartman enters the room, awed by the people he sees around him, and approaches the main desk. He hands the document to the man waiting there] I am John Hancock, President of the Congress."
1073,7,4,Cartman,Wow.
1074,7,4,John Hancock,Mr. John Adams?
1075,7,4,John Adams,Aye. [rises and approaches the table]
1076,7,4,John Hancock,"Will you do the honors of reading the document to Congress, please? [Cartman takes an empty chair nearby]"
1077,7,4,John Adams,"[reading from the Declaration] WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one Penis to rise up- [cut to the end of the Declaration] -we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.P.S. - Every Thursday should be Free Ice Cream Day. [rolls up the Declaration. Cartman looks around]"
1078,7,4,A Congressman,"Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England?"
1079,7,4,John Adams,"We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson. [chatter erupts]"
1080,7,4,Mr Mackey,"All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? [people within the crowd clap. Randy comes out dressed in an Elvis outfit]."
1081,7,4,Skeeter,"Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! [raises a fist. Other people within the crowd clap]"
1082,7,4,Mr Mackey,"And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war."
1083,7,4,Skeeter,Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!
1084,7,4,Jimbo,Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
1085,7,4,Mayor McDaniels,"[intervenes] People, I told you, you have to share the stage."
1086,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
1087,7,4,Skeeter,Well excuse me if... I'm a little bit country.
1088,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
1089,7,4,Skeeter,I'm a little for supportin' our troops.
1090,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
1091,7,4,Skeeter,I believe freedom isn't free.
1092,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"No, but war shouldn't be our goal."
1093,7,4,Skeeter,We must defend our country.
1094,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"If it means war, then we say NO!"
1095,7,4,Somebody,Yeehaw!
1096,7,4,Skeeter,"[walks to the edge of the stage in front of the war support crowd, then sits on the edge]

Did you forget them towers in New York?
Did you forget how it made you feel
To see them towers come down?
Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?"
1097,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!"
1098,7,4,Skeeter,"We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead."
1099,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Why are we fightin' this war?
There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.
They didn't give me a choice.
War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!"
1100,7,4,John Adams,We must go to war!
1101,7,4,"The Continental Congress

 John Dickinson","But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy."
1102,7,4,Congressman 1,England will only understand one thing: Force.
1103,7,4,Congressman 2,"[rises] I must state again for the record that South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia are against war! [pounds the table with his fist]"
1104,7,4,Congressman 3,"Yeah, because you don't care about the fate of the Colonies like we do! You're all unpatriotic! And if you don't like the Colonies, then you can get out!"
1105,7,4,"The Continental Congress

 John Hancock
 John Dickinson",Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want! [the various Congressmen begin babbling with each other]
1106,7,4,Cartman,"[observing] Whoa, how very very relevant."
1107,7,4,Reporter Tom Stansel,"Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in."
1108,7,4,Mr Mackey,"And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. [Stan walks up to the mic, watching the crowd on the way there. Kyle follows. The crowd claps appreciatively]"
1109,7,4,Protesters,Booooo!!
1110,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[steps up] For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. [shows them off and backs out of the scene. The crowd applauds and quiets down]"
1111,7,4,Stan,"Uh, we didn't do it."
1112,7,4,Mr Mackey,What?
1113,7,4,Kyle,We didn't do our homework.
1114,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!
1115,7,4,Stan,"Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Daylight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-"
1116,7,4,Skeeter,That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!
1117,7,4,Mr Mackey,The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!
1118,7,4,War Pretesters and Supporters,Support!
1119,7,4,Protesters,Protest!
1120,7,4,War Pretesters and Supporters,Country!
1121,7,4,Protesters,Rock-n-roll!

1124,7,4,John Adams,We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!
1125,7,4,Congressman,Rabble!
1126,7,4,Congressmen,"Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble! [the doors open and in walks an august figure. The boisterous voices become hushed] Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. [they keep murmuring this as Franklin walks towards the main desk]"
1127,7,4,Cartman,"Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin."
1128,7,4,John Hancock,"Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?"
1129,7,4,Franklin,"I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?"
1130,7,4,Thomas Jefferson,"Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time."
1131,7,4,"The Continental Congress
 Thomas Jefferson
 John Adams
 John Hancock
 John Dickinson","Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it."
1132,7,4,Franklin,"And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless."
1133,7,4,John Adams,"[holding a slice of chocolate cake] It's like having your cake, and eating it, too."
1134,7,4,Congressman 2,Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another.
1135,7,4,John Hancock,And we will call that country the United States of America.
1136,7,4,Cartman,"Wow, I get it now! I get it! [senses his flashback coming to an end] Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time."
1137,7,4,Cartman,Wow!
1138,7,4,Cartman,"[appears on stage in his hospital gown, his hair disheveled] Everyone, stop! Please! [everyone stops and looks at him]"
1139,7,4,Townsman,"The-the child! The child, from the hospital."
1140,7,4,Cartman,"If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say."
1141,7,4,Stan,He does? [he and Kyle are shocked]
1142,7,4,Kyle,He does?
1143,7,4,Cartman,"I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to. [a shot of the crowd]"
1144,7,4,Cartman,"You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too."""
1145,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
1146,7,4,Skeeter,"Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President."
1147,7,4,Gerald Broflovski,"And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China."
1148,7,4,Mr Mackey,I guess we... owe you an apology.
1149,7,4,Stuart McCormick,"Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one."
1150,7,4,Townsfolk,Awww. [amid a chorus of awwws they hug each other.]
1151,7,4,Kyle,Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
1152,7,4,Stan,Can't be
1153,7,4,Cartman,"The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass."
1154,7,4,Skeeter,Hey I'm a little bit country
1155,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
1156,7,4,Skeeter,I'll be the muscle of America
1157,7,4,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"And me, I'll be the caring soul."
1158,7,5,Kyle,"[wearing an argyle sweater] ...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. [cheers from the school crowd before him]"
1159,7,5,Principal Victoria,"[approaches the mic] Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski."
1160,7,5,Mr Mackey,"[as Kyle approaches him] That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. [a shot of the council, which is comprised of five Latinos. ]"
1161,7,5,Kyle,Cool.
1162,7,5,Principal Victoria,"All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman. [reads again in disbelief] Eric Cartman? [a smattering of applause from the kids in the crowd]"
1163,7,5,Cartman,[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back] Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
1164,7,5,Kids,Jennifer Lopez?
1165,7,5,Kyle,No way.
1166,7,5,Cartman,"[shows off his left hand, which is open] Miss Lopez, come on out here. [the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it]"
1167,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[Cartman begins to speak in a Spanish cartoon accent and his lips form a tiny smile as his hand begins to move] Hallooo. [the hand sports a small wig and a paper cutout of a woman's body hanging down from it. The cutout wears a white top and shorts and a heavy brown coat. The cutout's right hand sports some yellow bracelets]
1168,7,5,Principal Victoria,"[taken aback] Oh, Jesus Christ."
1169,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos."
1170,7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?"
1171,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh si, si. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress."
1172,7,5,Cartman,"Oh, you mean this one? [whips out a doll's dress for the occasion]"
1173,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Oh si si si. I like it very much.
1174,7,5,Cartman,"[fits the dress under his hand] There we go, Saright?"
1175,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Saright.
1176,7,5,Cartman,That's a very pretty dress. [the Latino Endowment Council is shown again]
1177,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,It better be! I am Hennifer Lopez!
1178,7,5,Cartman,"Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez."
1179,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,si si. [enunciating] Hennifer Lopez!
1180,7,5,Cartman,"Nono, Jeh-"
1181,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Heh-
1182,7,5,Cartman,Jeh-
1183,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Heh-
1184,7,5,Cartman,Jeh
1185,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Jeh
1186,7,5,Cartman,Jennifer Lopez.
1187,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Hennifer Lopez [members of the council laugh and clap]
1188,7,5,A Council Member,"Hahahahaha, oh my."
1189,7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?"
1190,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy."
1191,7,5,Cartman,"And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. [Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation. The members of the Latino Endowment council jump up and down with joy and pride. Stan and Kenny clap with everyone else, Kyle is just stunned.]"
1192,7,5,Cartman,Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
1193,7,5,Kyle,It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
1194,7,5,Cartman,"Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle."
1195,7,5,Kyle,"No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!"
1196,7,5,Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle] Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez."
1197,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Aww, that makes me muy triste."
1198,7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?"
1199,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh si si, very much."
1200,7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?"
1201,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh si, si si, my kisses taste like tacos. [Cartman plants his fist on Kyle's lips and makes kissing noises, then removes the hand]"
1202,7,5,Cartman,Is nice?
1203,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Is very nice. He's so handsome. [Cartman puts the hand back on Kyle's mouth and resumes the kissing noises]
1204,7,5,Kyle,[swats Cartman's hand away]Stop it!
1205,7,5,Cartman,"Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court."
1206,7,5,Kenny,(Woohoo!) [the boys go to the food court]
1207,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Mmm, tacos! So yummy!"
1208,7,5,Kyle,"Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!"
1209,7,5,Cartman,"Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too."
1210,7,5,Kyle,"She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!"
1211,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"When you eat a taco it comes out your backside too, cholo!"
1212,7,5,Kenny,"(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)"
1213,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Look look! Make your own music video! [they stop in front of a ""U R Da Star"", a music-video shop]"
1214,7,5,Kyle,"Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!"
1215,7,5,Cartman,I agree. Those places are stupid.
1216,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,It's not stupid. I need to make music video.
1217,7,5,Stan,"[to Cartman's hand] Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? [slaps Cartman's hand down] Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!"
1218,7,5,Cartman,"Hey, I'm on your guys' side."
1219,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[rises] Just wait one minute, let me see how much it is. [leads Cartman in. Stan and Kenny follow]"
1220,7,5,Kyle,God dammit! [follows reluctantly]
1221,7,5,Cashier,Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?
1222,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,How much to make a video?
1223,7,5,Cashier,"Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape."
1224,7,5,Cartman,Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
1225,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh please! Come on, guys!"
1226,7,5,Kyle,"Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!"
1227,7,5,Cartman,"All right all right, here's ten dollars! [takes out the bill and hands it to the cashier]"
1228,7,5,Kyle,That's not what I meant!
1229,7,5,Cashier,"All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen. [Cartman walks over to the screen] What kind of song do you want?"
1230,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Something hot and spicy.
1231,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Spicier.
1232,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Spicierrr!
1233,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco.
Don't think that just because I got a lot of money
I'll give you taco-flavored kisses, honey!
Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco."
1234,7,5,Cashier,"You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best!"
1235,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, gracias, ""Machel""! [the cashier's tag reads ""Michael""]"
1236,7,5,Cashier,"Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see it."
1237,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, gracias, Machel, gracias!"
1238,7,5,Kyle,"Can we go now, please?!"
1239,7,5,Cartman,"Yeah, I wanna leave."
1240,7,5,Kyle,"Stop it, Cartman!"
1241,7,5,Cartman,What?
1242,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.Taco taco.

1244,7,5,Aide 1,"[with brown hair] Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer Lopez."
1245,7,5,Aide 2,[in armchair] That makes sense. She reminds me of J-Lo.
1246,7,5,BHI President and Aides,"Yeah, but she's younger and spicier."
1247,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.
1248,7,5,Aide 2,I don't think J-Lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl.
1249,7,5,BHI President and Aides,"No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo."
1250,7,5,Cartman,"Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. [hands the phone to ""her""]"
1251,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, si si siiih. Allo!"
1252,7,5,Cartman,What do they want?
1253,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[looks at Cartman] Just a second, I'm trying to hear."
1254,7,5,Cartman,S'awright?
1255,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"S'awright. [returns to ""her"" call] Yes yes, this is Ms. Hrrrlopez. Uh huh. [gasps and screams ""her"" head off]"
1256,7,5,Cartman,What? What?
1257,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Oh my God I can't believe it!!!
1258,7,5,Cartman,"[puts the phone to his ear] Hello, are you still there?"
1259,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,They want to sign me to the record company!
1260,7,5,Cartman,You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
1261,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh my God, it's happening for me!"
1262,7,5,Cartman,"Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!! [hangs up and grins] We're gonna be rich!"
1263,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,We're gonna be famose!
1264,7,5,Cartman,"Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! [runs off]"
1265,7,5,Cartman,There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
1266,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, si si siiih."
1267,7,5,Cartman,"[scoots back to his bedside lamp and turns it off, then settles under the covers] Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. [rubs off her open eyes and paints some closed lids on his hand.]"
1268,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Ohh, I'm so sleeeepyyy."
1269,7,5,Cartman,"Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow... [begins to dream of taunting Kyle] Tomorrow..."
1270,7,5,Cartman,"""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!"" [in class, sitting next to each other] ""You were wrong, Kyle!"" [in the cafeteria, as Kyle walks by with his lunch] ""Nananananaaana!"" [on the bus ride home] ""Hahahahahaaaha!"" [images of Kyle come forth, crying] ""Nananananaaana!"" ""Hahahahahaaaha!"" [in his sleep] Awesommme. Yeeessss."
1271,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[has dreams of its own] Aaahhhh. Aaahhhh.
1272,7,5,Man 1,Ms. Lopez! Up here!
1273,7,5,Man 2,"Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!"
1274,7,5,Man 3,"Jennifer, over here."
1275,7,5,Man 4,Jennifer!
1276,7,5,Female fan,[stageside] We love you Jennifer! [roses land onstage. Shots of three magazines follow.]
1277,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[back to Cartman's room] Aaahhhh.
1278,7,5,BHI President and Aides,"Ah, Ms. Lopez, come on in."
1279,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[carrying a toy poodle takes a seat and removes her glasses] Yo, make it quick. I got a video shoot at two and a script reading at five."
1280,7,5,BHI President and Aides,"Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopez, we regret to inform you that, uh... we're dropping you from the label."
1281,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,What? Oh no you di'n't!
1282,7,5,Aide 1,"We wanna thank you for all your hard work and ...""talent""."
1283,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[pounds her table] You can't drop me! I'm Jennifer Lopez! How can you drop me?!
1284,7,5,BHI President and Aides,"Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records."
1285,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Who the hell is this other Jennifer Lopez?! Where is she come from?!
1286,7,5,Aide 1,"Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado now, but uh I believe she originally from Mexico, just like you."
1287,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,I don't come from no Mexico! I'm Puer'ah Rican!
1288,7,5,BHI President and Aides,"Whatever. Look, it's nothing personal, we just think you need to move on."
1289,7,5,Aide 2,Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous.
1290,7,5,Reporter,And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck.
1291,7,5,Ben,"[sitting at the other end of the passenger cabin] Huhuhuh, that's me. [a door opens opposite him and J-Lo enters] How'd it go, baby?"
1292,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Terrible, Ben! Some girl in Colorado is trying to become the new Jennifer Lopez! [her dog begins to bark] Shut up! [a few more barks and she tosses it out the window.]"
1293,7,5,Ben,What?? Who could replace you??
1294,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[tries to get the driver's attention] Yo driver. Stupid driver!
1295,7,5,Driver,"[looks back] Yes, ma'am. Where to?"
1296,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Take me to South Park, Colorado! I'm gonna kill that bitch!!"
1297,7,5,Cartman,[runs up] Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! [Slience.]
1298,7,5,Kyle,[decide to answer] ...What?
1299,7,5,Cartman,"[approaches him] Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!"
1300,7,5,Stan,What are you gloating about?
1301,7,5,Cartman,"Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week."
1302,7,5,Kids in Class,"Wow, really?"
1303,7,5,Kyle,No!
1304,7,5,Cartman,"[a slight gloat arises] Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich. [nods to his hand] And famous."
1305,7,5,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals."
1306,7,5,Butters,"[pipes up and turns to the class] Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!"
1307,7,5,Mr Garrison,"Butters, will you pay attention, please?"
1308,7,5,Butters,"Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!"
1309,7,5,Cartman,Jennifer Lopez?
1310,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Yes?
1311,7,5,Butters,"Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!"
1312,7,5,A boy,"Wow, cool! [the kids leave their seats and head for the window]"
1313,7,5,Mr Garrison,"Will you kids shut up? [puts his book away and walks to the window] Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are not-! Oh my God, that's Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. [the limo has pulled up. Jennifer and Ben climb out of the limo and the driver directs them to the office.]"
1314,7,5,Mr Slave,"Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?"
1315,7,5,Mr Garrison,Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! [rushes out and the cheering class and Mr. Slave follow]
1316,7,5,Principal Victoria,Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?
1317,7,5,Mr Mackey,Here she comes! Here she comes!
1318,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!"
1319,7,5,Principal Victoria,"[Mr. Adler takes a picture] J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?"
1320,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[begins pacing] No! Shut up! If I find the ho who thinks she's taken my career from me, I'm gonna wring her pretty little neck! [reaches the other end of the crowd] So, nobody want's to fess up, huh? Too scared to talk?! You'd better remember, bitch, that I'll come and take you down if you ever say anythin' again! [walks away]"
1321,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[a few seconds later...] You can suck my culo, chica! [Cartman looks up, stunned, as Jennifer Lopez returns to the crowd]"
1322,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[looks around] Who was that?! [all the kids back away from Cartman while pointing at him] You go' a problem?!
1323,7,5,Cartman,Not me!
1324,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Then who? [Cartman brings out his hand and points to it with the other]
1325,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Hola, bitchola! [Cartman is looking ever more fearful]"
1326,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,What the hell is that?!
1327,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like tacos, and burritos."
1328,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,That? That's what replaced me?!
1329,7,5,Cartman,I'm sure it was just a mistake.
1330,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Only mistake was when this ghetto trash got signed in the first place!
1331,7,5,Cartman,Shut your God-damned mouth!
1332,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[picks Cartman up by the scruff of his jacket] You fucking smartass, who do you think you are?!"
1333,7,5,Cartman,Nobody!
1334,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"I am Yennifer Hrlopez! I eat tacos, and burritos!"
1335,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Fuck you! [begins to assault Cartman's hand]
1336,7,5,Cartman,Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
1337,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,You'd better stop!
1338,7,5,Cartman,I will!
1339,7,5,Ben,"[walks up to join Jennifer] Come on, Jenny, let's go."
1340,7,5,Bebe,"Wow, Ben Affleck."
1341,7,5,Ben,We should be getting back to the... [something grabs his attention. Cartman looks away. Ben begins to fall for this new Jennifer Lopez]
1342,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny!"
1343,7,5,Kyle,"Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson."
1344,7,5,Cartman,Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
1345,7,5,Kyle,Good.
1346,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[rises once more] Or maybe I shou-ould.
1347,7,5,Kyle,"Aw, God-dammit!"
1348,7,5,Cartman,"Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez."
1349,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Ohsisisi, senor."
1350,7,5,Kyle,That does it. I'm out. [walks off]
1351,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, where are you going, Kyle? Come give me kisses!"
1352,7,5,Aide 1,"All right, Ms. Lopez, take it from the top. [music begins. Cartman is on a stool with his puppet at his side.]"
1353,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Baby let's make a run for the border,
I've got a hunger only tacos can stop.
I know exactly what I'll order
Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop."
1354,7,5,BHI President and Aides,"Gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit."
1355,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"I need to make a run for the border,
If you pay I'll take off my top.
Do you remember what I want to order?
Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop.
Yeah-eah, and don't forget the hot sauce, Cholo!"
1356,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Don't think just because I got money

1358,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,I'm practicing my dancinngg!
1359,7,5,Cartman,"Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!"
1360,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Dancing!

1362,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Dancing!
1363,7,5,Cartman,"[slowly, whiney] Sleep!"
1364,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[slowly, invitingly] Dancing!"
1365,7,5,Cartman,Moooommm! [Cartman's mother enters the room]
1366,7,5,Liane Cartman,"What's the matter, sweetie?"
1367,7,5,Cartman,Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
1368,7,5,Cartman,[real tired] He-yesss.
1369,7,5,Ben,"Hey, I was wondering if I could talk to Ms. Lopez."
1370,7,5,Cartman,[hides his left hand] She's not here right now.
1371,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[muffled] Ben? Is that my darling Ben?
1372,7,5,Ben,"Jenny? Yes, Jenny, eheh, it's me! Where are you? Please, I-I have to see her! [Cartman sighs deeply, then shows his hand to Ben]"
1373,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Ben!!! Oh, you brought me roses!"
1374,7,5,Ben,"Jenny, ah Jenny I just can't stop thinking about you. [lowers the bouquet to Cartman, who takes it away angrily]"
1375,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"I can't stop thinking about you either, Ben!"
1376,7,5,Ben,"I've been meaning to write a song or a poem, but I have no talent."
1377,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"I know, my darleeeng. That's okay."
1378,7,5,Ben,Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?
1379,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh Ben, I would LOVE to!"
1380,7,5,Cartman,NO!
1381,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"'Scuse me one second, Ben. [whips towards Cartman] Don't you ruin this opportunity for me! How can you stand in the way of this?!"
1382,7,5,Cartman,I'm not going out in his car.
1383,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,I'm not gonna let you blow this one chance I have.
1384,7,5,Cartman,I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework. [Ben stars picking his nose]
1385,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Don't you dare [becomes unintelligible]
1386,7,5,Cartman,"I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!"
1387,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Okay, Ben, let's go!"
1388,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh Ben, I am soo happy! The cool breeze blowing through my hair in your sexy automobile."

1392,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Hoohh, I love you too, Ben! [Cartman looks away in disgust] But..."
1393,7,5,Ben,But what?
1394,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,But what if you still have feelings for the slut with the large ass?
1395,7,5,Ben,"[pulls off to the side, with South Park in view.] I still care for her. Maybe I always will. But... You just have so much more going on. Up here. [strokes the top of Cartman's hand]"
1396,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Oh Ben. Beennn.
1397,7,5,Ben,"Jenny, can I kiss you?"
1398,7,5,Cartman,[reacts] NO!
1399,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Yes! Oh yes, Ben, kiss me! [Cartman looks in wonder as his hand gets a mind of its own]"
1400,7,5,Cartman,"Aw, God dammit! [looks away in disgust once more. Ben begins to give French kisses to ""Jennifer Lopez"" and the hand responds] Aww- awww, dude!"
1401,7,5,Ben,"Mmm, just like tacos."
1402,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Taco-flavored kisses for my Ben.
1403,7,5,Ben,"You're so hot, baby."
1404,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"I make you hot, Ben?"
1405,7,5,Ben,"Mm, yeah. [grabs the hand and kisses it for a while, then lets go. The hand drops down into Ben's pants] Oh, Jenny. [the zipper goes down on his pants] Oh Jenny! [""Jennifer Lopez"" bobs up and down]"
1406,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[pops up to say] Ben... [drops down again]
1407,7,5,Ben,"Oh God, Jenny!"
1408,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, Ben, I adore you! [Cartman looks at Ben's actions, then at what his hand is doing...]"
1409,7,5,Cartman,"OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT! [opens his door, hops out, and walks away] WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!"
1410,7,5,Ben,But I love her!
1411,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Ben!
1412,7,5,Ben,"Jenny! Jenny, I'll call you!"
1413,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"I love you, Ben!"
1414,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?
Two tacos chulo, too. I'm just Jenny from the hood.
Ooo, can I have your tacos? Oh- stop. Stop, stop. STOP!"
1415,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[the band stops playing] What the hell is wrong with you?! You cholos can't even keep a beat! I deserve better than thees! I an Hennifer Lopez! Where is my water?! [a page brings ""her"" a bottle of water. ""Jennifer Lopez"" knocks it onto the floor] Not Evian, Pellegrino, you stupid beetch!"
1416,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?"
1417,7,5,Aide 2,"Uh, that's fine Ms. Lopez. Look, it's been a long night. Why don't we pick it up in the morning?"
1418,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Fine my ass, cholo! [Cartman wakes up and looks at his hand] I'll tell you when it's fine!"
1419,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Stupid idiots! How am I supposed to make an album with those cholos?! [a bat hits a car nearby]
1420,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[stands next to the car she just bashed] You little snot-nose! [Cartman is taken aback] You ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?! [holds up the tabloid shown earlier]
1421,7,5,Cartman,Aww crap.
1422,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,You'd better stay away from him! [begins whacking away at Cartman's hand]
1423,7,5,Cartman,OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
1424,7,5,Dr Doctor,Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers.
1425,7,5,Liane Cartman,Oh dear.
1426,7,5,Dr Doctor,But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
1427,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[on its own hospital bed, with wires attached] Ahhh Ahhhh [Cartman sits in a chair displeased]"
1428,7,5,Cartman,"I told you this would happen. [Kyle, Stan and Kenny show up.]"
1429,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, hello guys."
1430,7,5,Kyle,"Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!"
1431,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, Kyle, why you no like meee?"
1432,7,5,Cartman,"Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck."
1433,7,5,Kyle,I hate you. [turns right and walks out]
1434,7,5,Liane Cartman,"Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest."
1435,7,5,Cartman,"EHAGH! [next to him is Ben Affleck, naked and relaxed] Moooooommmm! [Ben wakes up]"
1436,7,5,Liane Cartman,"[enters with a cup of coffee and wearing a pink robe] What is it, sweetie?"
1437,7,5,Cartman,Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
1438,7,5,Liane Cartman,"Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with you.[backs out of the room and closes the door.]"
1439,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"Buenos dias, my love."
1440,7,5,Ben,"Good morning, baby."
1441,7,5,Cartman,You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
1442,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,He's not going anywhere! Ben and I were up all night making love.
1443,7,5,Cartman,What? Oh- AWWW! [wipes his hand off on his pajamas] Ben Affleck's spooge!!
1444,7,5,Ben,Should we tell him the news?
1445,7,5,Cartman,What news?
1446,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,I think we should tell him.
1447,7,5,Ben,It's S'aright?
1448,7,5,Cartman,S'aright.
1449,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,S'aright.
1450,7,5,Ben,We're getting married!!
1451,7,5,Cartman,"Oh, balls!"
1452,7,5,Kyle,Come in. [the bell rings again.] COME IN!! [Cartman enters wearing an oven mitt over his left hand.]
1453,7,5,Cartman,"[sad] Guys, I need to talk to you."
1454,7,5,Stan,What's the matter?
1455,7,5,Cartman,"I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez."
1456,7,5,Kyle,So stop doing it!
1457,7,5,Cartman,Stop doing what?
1458,7,5,Kyle,You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
1459,7,5,Cartman,"Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and ""Jennifer Lopez"" emerges coughing]"
1460,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Don't you dare ever do that to me again!
1461,7,5,Kyle,"Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe!"
1462,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!
1463,7,5,Kyle,I can see your lips moving!
1464,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"I can see your lips moving too, culo!"
1465,7,5,Kyle,See?! I just saw your lips move!
1466,7,5,Cartman,Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
1467,7,5,Stan,What's she doing?
1468,7,5,Kyle,"Come here! [drags Stan off to the dining room] You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!"
1469,7,5,Stan,"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it."
1470,7,5,Kyle,"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, [Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman] ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!"""
1471,7,5,Stan,"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?"
1472,7,5,Kyle,"YES, dude! [they then walk back into the living room]"
1473,7,5,Stan,"Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you."
1474,7,5,Cartman,"Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does."
1475,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Oh no you don't!
1476,7,5,Cartman,"Quiet, Ms. Lopez."
1477,7,5,Kyle,Out! [walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out]
1478,7,5,Cartman,"Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]"
1479,7,5,Ben,"There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! [Cartman decides to run in the other direction] Jenny? [Cartman sees a car pull up in front of him and then...]"
1480,7,5,Aide 1,"Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! [Cartman decides to ran back towards Ben, but runs into a pair of female legs]"
1481,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[disheveled, wielding a running chainsaw over her head] So you're gettin' married, huh? [revs up the motor, and Cartman makes his escape, screaming. In the background, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny have stepped out the door to see what's going on.]"
1482,7,5,Ben,Don't you hurt her!
1483,7,5,BHI President and Aides,We'll sue you!
1484,7,5,Kyle,Oh Jesus.
1485,7,5,Police Officer 1,"Freeze, leafblower! [she drops the chainsaw and holds her hands up]"
1486,7,5,Aide 1,Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! [the arrest is made]
1487,7,5,Police Officer 2,"All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath."
1488,7,5,Ben,"[rushes up to ""Jennifer Lopez""] Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!"
1489,7,5,Aide 2,"Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive]"
1490,7,5,Ben,Our love is like rain!
1491,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"That's what you said about me, asshole!"
1492,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Quiet!
1493,7,5,BHI President and Aides,Get her out of here!
1494,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Fuck you!
1495,7,5,Police Officer 2,"Shut up, picante pants!"
1496,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Everyone be quiet! [Everyone stops what they're doing and look at the hand] I'm... I'm not who you think I am.
1497,7,5,BHI President and Aides,You're not?
1498,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot continue anymore. I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am... [Cartman rips off the small wig he had on his hand and delivers a new voice] ...Mitch Connor. [everyone, including Kyle, gasps]"
1499,7,5,Police Officer 2,Who's Mitch Connor?
1500,7,5,Mitch Connor,"Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'."
1501,7,5,Kyle,"[exasperated] Oh no, no, no."
1502,7,5,Mitch Connor,"I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time."
1503,7,5,Kyle,Stop. It.
1504,7,5,Mitch Connor,"Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart. [Ben begins to sob. Cartman walks to one side of the bridge] But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down. I wonder, will I dream? [as the sun drops below the horizon, Cartman opens his hand and a gust of wind is heard. Whatever was possessing the hand parted. Ben sobs once more as Cartman just stares in wonder]"
1505,7,5,Police Officer 2,"Well, looks like Mitch Connor has cashed in his last chips. [everyone disperses except the boys. Ben stays on for a second, but he too leaves.]"
1506,7,5,Kyle,"[the boys step forward] Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?"
1507,7,5,Cartman,"I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?"
1508,7,5,Kyle,"[resigns] All right. [Cartman beams] All right, I guess it's possible."
1509,7,5,Cartman,[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
1510,7,5,Manager,"Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce will go on. [a man carrying a large bowl walks up behind Lopez and bumps into her]"
1511,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[jumping to one side] Ow. Look out, muffinhead!"
1512,7,5,Manager,"Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people."
1513,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,Get a what with who?
1514,7,5,Manager,Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?
1515,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,[begins chopping the onions] This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working at a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!
1516,7,5,Coworker,Yeah. Meee too.
1517,7,5,Cartman as Jennifer Lopez,"[as credits roll]
Oh Ben, you are so perfect, so spectacularrr in every way
You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget all about...
Tacos! Oh, tacos, so good in my tummy yummy yummy give me more.
I love you, Ben. You almost make me forget about...
Tacos..."
1518,7,6,Chris Stotch,"Yes? [looks down] Oh, hello, boys."
1519,7,6,Cartman,"Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar."
1520,7,6,Chris Stotch,"Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now."
1521,7,6,Kyle,"Awww, shit!"
1522,7,6,Stan,"All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. [offers up a business card]"
1523,7,6,Chris Stotch,"I'll do that. Have fun, boys. [steps back and closes the door. The boys turn and walk away]"
1524,7,6,Cartman,Stupid assholes! [turns and follows] How come nobody has a crime to solve?
1525,7,6,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a great idea."
1526,7,6,Stan,"It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. [moments later they reach a pink house and Stan knocks again. The door opens and an elderly woman looks out]"
1527,7,6,Mrs Farnickle,"Oh, hello there boys."
1528,7,6,Stan,"Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need solved, for a dollar?"
1529,7,6,Mrs Farnickle,"Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something!"
1530,7,6,Kyle,Really?
1531,7,6,Mrs Farnickle,"Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool. [Stan and Kyle look over at the window] And later, when I went to get it, it was gone."
1532,7,6,Cartman,My God...
1533,7,6,Stan,Have you reported this to any other authorities?
1534,7,6,Mrs Farnickle,"Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids."
1535,7,6,Kyle,"Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am."
1536,7,6,Stan,We're on the case.
1537,7,6,Cartman,"What have you got, Marsh?"
1538,7,6,Stan,"Detective McCormick found something interesting. [a shot of Kenny, who just raises his arm and point to his right. The camera pans to Duke, the house pet, licking off the last of the pie]"
1539,7,6,Cartman,"[puts a hand on Kyle, looks away and closes his eyes] Jesus, we're too late."
1540,7,6,Kyle,I think we can piece this case together now.
1541,7,6,Mrs Farnickle,"My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?"
1542,7,6,Kyle,"Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory."
1543,7,6,Mr Farnickle,"Well, what do you think happened, little detectives?"
1544,7,6,Stan,"You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time. [the scenario shows Mrs. Farnickle setting the pie on the sill, closing the windows and walking away] But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. [Mr. Farnickle shows up at the kitchen window, looking at the pie from inside the kitchen]"
1545,7,6,Kyle,"Your husband. [he looks closer at it, putting his hands on the window] He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet."
1546,7,6,Cartman,"Slowly the rage built inside his mind. [Mr. Farnickle is shown in bed, getting angry. Dramatic lighting enhances the mood] ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!"
1547,7,6,Stan,His plan was to use a hammer.
1548,7,6,Cartman,"Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. [the scenario shows Mr. Farnickle walking up behind his wife as she dusts the TV and whacking her three times, killing her and fracturing her skull]"
1549,7,6,Stan,"Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. [the man plunges the shovel through the woman's neck and cleaves the head from the body. Blood pours out and stains the carpet]"
1550,7,6,Kyle,Then saw off the arms and legs. [shown in all its graphic glory]
1551,7,6,Cartman,"The torso he would dump into the lake. [Mr. Farnickle tosses his wife's torso over the side of his boat, then watches as the torso heads for the lake bottom]"
1552,7,6,Stan,"The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. [the man is shown tossing the second leg into the tub, then stirring the solution so that the leg would sink in and disappear]"
1553,7,6,Cartman,"And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie."
1554,7,6,Kyle,"But before he could go through with his entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten... [a new scenario: the man now has the hammer, but the pie is gone when he checks up on it] ...by your dog. [a shot of Duke eating the pie in his doghouse]"
1555,7,6,Cartman,"Looks like the game is over, old man! [the surprised couple looks at them]"
1556,7,6,Mrs Farnickle,"Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching??"
1557,7,6,Stan,Just the news.
1558,7,6,Mrs Farnickle,"All right, all right, you you boys run along now."
1559,7,6,Stan,"[stays behind] Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady."
1560,7,6,Mrs Farnickle,"Fine, here, just go! [gives him the dollar, and he joins the others outside]"
1561,7,6,Stan,"Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! [shows off a crisp new one-dollar bill]"
1562,7,6,Kyle,We're in business!
1563,7,6,Cartman,"Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington."
1564,7,6,Liane Cartman,"Boys, you have a little visitor. [a little girl descends the stairs past Liane]"
1565,7,6,Girl,Is this the South Park Crime Unit?
1566,7,6,The Boys,Ah! Oh. [they jump up and leave their tasks to meet their first client]
1567,7,6,Stan,Yes it is!
1568,7,6,Girl,I lost my dolly.
1569,7,6,Cartman,"[waving his mom off] Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all. [Liane goes upstairs. Cartman looks up] And get us some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!"
1570,7,6,Kyle,Do you know where your doll is?
1571,7,6,Girl,"If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost."
1572,7,6,Stan,"All right, Sarah, come over here. [everyone moves over to Kenny's desk. Sarah hops up on the witness chair] Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny."
1573,7,6,Sarah Peterson and her Mom.,[Kenny begins to draw as she talks] She has curly blonde hair. And a wed dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue bow in her hair.
1574,7,6,Stan,"You got it, Ken? [Kenny finishes and nods]"
1575,7,6,Kyle,"All right, let's see. [Kenny turns the paper around and shows off a crudely-drawn woman with huge, olive-shaped boobs] Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!"
1576,7,6,Stan,"Put that away, dude! [Kenny walks up to a small bulletin board of KeNnY'S mOST WANtED women, all of which have large boobs]"
1577,7,6,Cartman,"Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll."
1578,7,6,Cartman,No sign of forced entry.
1579,7,6,Kyle,[at the window] But the window isn't locked.
1580,7,6,Stan,"[turns to address Cartman] Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree. [the scenario begins. A view into the bedroom from the tree at night] He would have watched Sarah with her doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife. [a hand appears, then the opposite hand with a knife. The knife cuts the first hand as Sarah drops her doll on the bedroom floor] The pain gave him sick pleasure."
1581,7,6,Kyle,Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
1582,7,6,Cartman,We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.
1583,7,6,A Boy,"All right, let's do this by the books! McDonnell, [one boy steps forward] give me smears of all the places the doll used to be! [goes off to get samples] Mitchell, [another boy steps forward] run a tap on the phone! [goes off to tap the phone]"
1584,7,6,Stan,"[approaches the boy] Hey, kid, what are you doing?"
1585,7,6,The Boy,"Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?"
1586,7,6,Stan,Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
1587,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker","...Not anymore, you're not!"
1588,7,6,Cartman,"Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!"
1589,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker",Can't we? You guys are playing Detectives. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you!
1590,7,6,Stan,Aw crap!
1591,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker","I want choppers on the roof ready to go! [one of his friends goes to the window, the other two head out of the room]"
1592,7,6,Kyle,"Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!"
1593,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker",Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.
1594,7,6,Stan,Son of a bitch stupid FBI!
1595,7,6,Cartman,"Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat."
1596,7,6,Stan,No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that little girl's doll before those FBI guys do.
1597,7,6,Kenny,(Yeah!)
1598,7,6,Kyle,"Yeah, but how?"
1599,7,6,Stan,We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
1600,7,6,Cartman,Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
1601,7,6,Cartman,"[thinks hard of how to start the interrogation] Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!"
1602,7,6,Butters,"Ah, I was at home."
1603,7,6,Cartman,"Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! [behind him, Stan and Kyle watch from a makeshift booth]"
1604,7,6,Kenny,"[patting Butters' shoulder] (Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) [Butters smiles]"
1605,7,6,Stan,[behind the booth] They've gotten really good at this good-cop bad-cop thing.
1606,7,6,Cartman,"You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!"
1607,7,6,Kenny,"(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)"
1608,7,6,Cartman,You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
1609,7,6,Kenny,"(Aww, it's okay, little fella.)"
1610,7,6,Butters,Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
1611,7,6,Cartman,Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. [holds out a cup for Butters to take]
1612,7,6,Butters,How do I do that?
1613,7,6,Cartman,You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
1614,7,6,Butters,Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
1615,7,6,Cartman,Stop playing games!
1616,7,6,Butters,I'm not playing. I really don't know!
1617,7,6,Cartman,"That does it! Wait right here! [goes behind the booth and laughs] Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body."
1618,7,6,Kyle,How... do you make semen come out?
1619,7,6,Cartman,I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
1620,7,6,Stan,It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
1621,7,6,Cartman,Really?
1622,7,6,Kyle,"Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast."
1623,7,6,Cartman,"Oh okay. [returns to the table] Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!"
1624,7,6,Butters,No!
1625,7,6,Cartman,Follow me to the bathroom. [goes upstairs]
1626,7,6,Kenny,"[soothing] (Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) [Butters hops off the chair and follows Cartman upstairs]"
1627,7,6,Cartman,"Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup."
1628,7,6,Butters,My wiener??
1629,7,6,Cartman,"Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it! [Butters grabs the door handle and shuts the door. Cartman waits for a few second before doing anything] Well, Butters?!"
1630,7,6,Butters,"Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening."
1631,7,6,Cartman,Well pull harder!
1632,7,6,Butters,...ow... Ow... It's not workin'.
1633,7,6,Cartman,Try doin' it faster.
1634,7,6,Butters,"[increasing the speed] Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'."
1635,7,6,Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!"
1636,7,6,Butters,NOOooo!
1637,7,6,Cartman,The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
1638,7,6,Butters,Okay!!
1639,7,6,Stan,[rushing up with Kyle and Kenny] Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
1640,7,6,Cartman,Let's go! [They leave. Butters remains in the bathroom]
1641,7,6,Butters,...ow... Ow!
1642,7,6,Bill and Fosse,"Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh, me and Doctor... Flick here just need to... check your vagina. [pulls up the front of the doll's dress and giggles with Bill]"
1643,7,6,Bill and Fosse,That's gay. [giggles with Fosse]
1644,7,6,Bill and Fosse,"Yeah, that's gay. [Cartman looks in intently. He then turns his back against the wall and backs away with his water pistol drawn]"
1645,7,6,Cartman,[in hushed tones] Kyle!
1646,7,6,Kyle,What? [Cartman repeats the gestures again] What??
1647,7,6,Cartman,"[repeats the gestures] I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!"
1648,7,6,Kyle,"[gasps, then with determination, in hushed tones] They've got the doll! [he, Stan, and Kenny move in and the four boys take positions around the door. Kyle stands at the door, Cartman and Kenny on either side, Stan at Kyle's back]"
1649,7,6,Stan,"[in hushed tones] Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! [Kenny turns and rings the bell. Inside, Bill and Fosse stop their play and go to the door]"
1650,7,6,Bill and Fosse,Huh huh who is it?!
1651,7,6,Stan,South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
1652,7,6,Bill and Fosse,[giggles] They're playing Detective. [they giggle]
1653,7,6,Bill and Fosse,That's gay. [they giggle]
1654,7,6,Bill and Fosse,"[calls out] You're gay! [outside, the boys lower their guns.]"
1655,7,6,Kyle,What do we do now?
1656,7,6,Stan,I don't know.
1657,7,6,Cartman,"Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. [hops down from the porch and walks away]"
1658,7,6,Stan,"Dude, we just can't tell on them."
1659,7,6,Cartman,Why not?
1660,7,6,Kyle,"Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people."
1661,7,6,Bill and Fosse,"[from inside] Detectives! [Cartman returns, and the camera angle switches to the living room. Bill and Fosse have made the doll a hostage, having tied her up on a chair. Fosse continues, giggling] If you don't get out of here, we're gonna rip the doll's head off!"
1662,7,6,Bill and Fosse,Yeah.
1663,7,6,Bill and Fosse,We were playing gynecologists and now we're playing criminals.
1664,7,6,Bill and Fosse,That's gay.
1665,7,6,Bill and Fosse,We're gay.
1666,7,6,Stan,Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
1667,7,6,Kyle,We've got to do something.
1668,7,6,Cartman,"Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!"
1669,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker","[offscreen] Attention! You in the house! [the other kids are shown, with their own little car] This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of."
1670,7,6,Stan,"[he and the others approach the FBI kids] Hey, you butt-holes can't play FBI here!"
1671,7,6,Cartman,Yeah! This was our hot lead!
1672,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker","And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way! [into the megaphone] The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you!"
1673,7,6,Stan,We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
1674,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker",No you're not.
1675,7,6,Cartman,"Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!"
1676,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker","Climb off, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules!"
1677,7,6,Stan,Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
1678,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker",Yes it does so! [a long pause]
1679,7,6,Kyle,...Grrrr!!! [the boys turn and walk away]
1680,7,6,Kenny,(What do we do now?)
1681,7,6,Stan,We go get the doll ourselves.
1682,7,6,Kyle,But they said we can't charge the front door.
1683,7,6,Stan,That's right. [cocks his left hand] But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
1684,7,6,"FBI Boys, led by ""Agent"" Tucker",Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll.
1685,7,6,Bill and Fosse,"Huhuh. [notices the SP boys coming in] Oh crap, they're coming in the back! [the shootout begins. The boys fan out and make firing noises as they aim at Bill and Fosse. Bill and Fosse return fire with their own noises] That's gay. [he and Fosse hide behind an armchair]"
1686,7,6,Stan,"[pops up from the couch and fires away, using the back of the couch as a shield] Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!"
1687,7,6,Bill and Fosse,No you didn't!
1688,7,6,Stan,Did so!
1689,7,6,Bill and Fosse,"No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on."
1690,7,6,Kyle,"We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, ass-face!"
1691,7,6,Cartman,"All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo! [moves out from behind the couch, shooting slowly but walking normally] Wwwaaahhh!"
1692,7,6,Bill and Fosse,"[makes sweeping gestures with his hands] Oooh, they got me! [falls a bit further with each] Whooaaa, whooaaa, whooaaa. [now fully stretched on the floor, closes his eyes as if dead]"
1693,7,6,Bill and Fosse,"[follows suit] rr uh rr uh, uhhhh. [makes like he's dead]"
1694,7,6,Bill and Fosse,[opens his eyes and giggles] We're dead.
1695,7,6,Bill and Fosse,[opens his eyes and giggles] That's gay.
1696,7,6,Stan,"[getting the doll after he, Kyle and Kenny approach the chair] We got it."
1697,7,6,Stan,"Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?"
1698,7,6,Sarah Peterson and her Mom.,[appears at the doorway and lights up as she runs for her doll] My dolly! [gets it and holds it tight]
1699,7,6,Cartman,We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process.
1700,7,6,Sarah s Mom,Well you boys are little heroes. I'm going to call the police department and let them know what brave little detectives you are! [the boys smile proudly]
1701,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll."
1702,7,6,Stan,"We do what we can, sir."
1703,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"Well, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Junior Detectives. [hands out badges]"
1704,7,6,Kyle,[Kyle opens his] Wow! [the others have similar reactions]
1705,7,6,Lt. Dawson,That means you boys are now an official part of the department.
1706,7,6,Cartman,Kewl!
1707,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"All right, so ready for your first assignment?"
1708,7,6,Stan,Sure.
1709,7,6,Lt. Dawson,Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!
1710,7,6,Kyle,Ah... a a a meth lab?
1711,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"[sits at his desk] I don't want any problems. Just take 'em down by the books. Now get over there; the mayor's all over my ass on this one! [the boys turn to leave] On, and deputies: you screw this up and I'll have you working graveyard shift behind a desk! Move it! [the boys run off]"
1712,7,6,Kyle,"What is a meth lab, anyway?"
1713,7,6,Stan,I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. [they turn and walk towards a large building in the distance]
1714,7,6,Stan,"Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?"
1715,7,6,Kyle,"Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. [windows begin breaking as shots are fired at the boys]"
1716,7,6,Man 1,"You die, pigs!"
1717,7,6,Man 3,You won't take us alive!
1718,7,6,Man 5,"So long, coppers!"
1719,7,6,Stan,Damn.
1720,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle worth sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixty thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass!"
1721,7,6,Stan,"Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-"
1722,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't even have guys to question now, because you killed them all!"
1723,7,6,Kyle,We're sorry.
1724,7,6,Lt. Dawson,One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers!
1725,7,6,Officer 1,"Well well well, if it isn't the super-cops. [the officers begin to giggle]"
1726,7,6,Officer 2,"Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes?"
1727,7,6,Officer 4,"Come on, you guys. Leave them alone."
1728,7,6,Murphy,"[Officer 1] Relax, Hopkins! [removes his briefs and drops them to the ground] All fun and games, right? [moves to the end of the lockers and hides behind it, only to peek out] Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house??"
1729,7,6,Cartman,Uh bonus?
1730,7,6,Murphy,Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that? [walks back to the other officers] You think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it?
1731,7,6,Stan,[softly] We just wanna be junior detectives.
1732,7,6,Murphy,"LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side?"
1733,7,6,Officer 2,Yeah! Who the hell are you to change that?!
1734,7,6,"Murphy, Jenkins, and Hopkins","I said, back off Murphy!"
1735,7,6,Murphy,Why don't you and your rookie friends make us
1736,7,6,Officer 2,"That's right. Come on, bring it!"
1737,7,6,Officer 3,"Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!"
1738,7,6,Lt. Dawson,What the hell is the problem here??
1739,7,6,Murphy,"No problem, sir. No problem at all."
1740,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"Then hit the showers, all of you!"
1741,7,6,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore."
1742,7,6,Cartman,Me neither.
1743,7,6,Stan,"It'll get better, guys."
1744,7,6,Kyle,"Better how, dude?"
1745,7,6,Stan,"[puts his soap away] Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time into it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?"
1746,7,6,Kyle,We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
1747,7,6,Stan,"I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?"
1748,7,6,Cartman,[intervening] Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
1749,7,6,Stan,"You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. I'll see you guys at school tomorrow."
1750,7,6,Cartman,Awwwwrrr-auugh. [hangs up his coat and holster on the coat tree in the living room]
1751,7,6,Liane Cartman,"Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty."
1752,7,6,Cartman,We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
1753,7,6,Liane Cartman,Well you should've called Mommy.
1754,7,6,Cartman,"[turns and snaps at her] Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?! [realizes what he's doing, then turns away] Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired."
1755,7,6,Liane Cartman,"Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?"
1756,7,6,Cartman,[straightens up and smiles] Okay. [turns and walks off to bed. He passes by the bathroom. Butters is still in there]
1757,7,6,Butters,Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!
1758,7,6,Cartman,[stops] Butters?
1759,7,6,Butters,Yes?
1760,7,6,Cartman,Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
1761,7,6,Butters,"Well I'm tryin', but nothing's comin' out."
1762,7,6,Cartman,"Well, keep tryin', Butters."
1763,7,6,Butters,Okay. [Cartman walks off] Ow. Ooww!
1764,7,6,Mr Garrison,"And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America. [turns around and quickly notices the sleeping boys] Uh, boys! [the boys stir and wake up] Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?"
1765,7,6,Kyle,"Uh we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison."
1766,7,6,Mr Garrison,"Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!"
1767,7,6,Cartman,[thinks] A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
1768,7,6,Mr Garrison,"Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?! [the boys look at each other, confused and afraid] That's what I thought! Now pay attention! [turns back to the board] Okay, children, now, the biggest skank of all was was an old fat-ass by the name of-"
1769,7,6,Lt. Dawson,[bursting through the classroom door] Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman! In my office! [leaves]
1770,7,6,The Boys,[hanging their heads] Eeagh!
1771,7,6,Lt. Dawson,Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.
1772,7,6,Cartman,Uh oh...
1773,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover. [the boys look at each other]"
1774,7,6,Kyle,"Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-"
1775,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin' you one last chance! You're good cops, but you let your emotions get in the way! And your little ""shoot first ask questions later"" technique has no place in this century! Now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books, you got it?! The mayor is on my ass and blablablah! [the boys turn left and walk off. As they head for the entrance they walk down the hall. Around one corner are two of the officers they met in the locker room]"
1776,7,6,Murphy,"So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant?"
1777,7,6,Stan,"Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff."
1778,7,6,Murphy,Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money.
1779,7,6,Kyle,No. [the boys walk away]
1780,7,6,Officer 2,They're lying.
1781,7,6,Murphy,They're dead!
1782,7,6,Kyle,"Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble."
1783,7,6,Kenny,"[stops and looks around, then jumps for joy] (Woohoo!!) [rushes up to catch the other boys, who now sit around a small stage]"
1784,7,6,Old Stripper,"[bloated woman with a coarse voice, opens an embrace to Stan] Would you like a dance?"
1785,7,6,Stan,No thanks.
1786,7,6,Old Stripper,[moves to Kyle] Dance? [moves on] Anyone like a dance?
1787,7,6,DJ at Peppermint Hippo's,"Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's hear it for Candy!"
1788,7,6,Bouncer,"[walks up to the boys] Whoa whoa, what the hell are you kids doin' in here? This isn't an appropriate place for children."
1789,7,6,Old Stripper,"[walking in the foreground, on the other side of the small stage] Dance? Anyone like a dance?"
1790,7,6,Kyle,"Uh, it's okay. We know the owner."
1791,7,6,Bouncer,"[crosses his arms] Oh, really? Let's go see."
1792,7,6,Owner,"All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and-"
1793,7,6,Bouncer,"Hey Gino, these kids say they know you."
1794,7,6,Gino and his goons,What? Ha-I don't know no kids.
1795,7,6,Bouncer,"I didn't think so. All right, you kids-"
1796,7,6,Gino and his goons,Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family?
1797,7,6,Tall Goon,"Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids before, man. These kids are 5-0!"
1798,7,6,Gino and his goons,What?
1799,7,6,Tall Goon,"These kids are cops, man! [the five men in the room assume positions and start firing away at the boys. A man at the door is shot and he falls away. The boys begin pretending to fire back and make shooting noises.]"
1800,7,6,Cartman,Bang bang bang... [the boys move behind a chair. The men continue firing. The boys move back into view]
1801,7,6,Stan,Bang bang bang... [the men move to lesser-powered weapons]
1802,7,6,Kyle,Bang bang bang... [the men move to lesser-powered weapons]
1803,7,6,Cartman,Bang bang bang... [the men move to lesser-powered weapons]
1804,7,6,Kenny,(Pakew! Pakew!)
1805,7,6,Cartman,"[looks at Kenny] Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!"" [outside, police cars of all types pull up to the club. Dawson quickly jumps out of his car. An explosion appears in two windows of the club, and Dawson ducks a little]"
1806,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"God damnit! Those junior detectives and their heroically reckless ways! Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there! [The three men move in. Jenkins is Officer 2. Inside, two of the owner's men rush out of the back room, and the strippers rush out of the way. The men turn around and shoot back at the boys. The boys return fire. None of the four boys has yet been hit. The gunfight continues. The old stripper walks by again]"
1807,7,6,Old Stripper,Dance??? Anybody like a dance??? [walks by without being hit once. The other two men appear and shoot at the boys]
1808,7,6,"Murphy, Jenkins, and Hopkins","[enters the club] Freeze! South Park detectives! [Murphy and Jacobs quickly enter and take aim. Everyone stops and turns around to face the detectives. The DJ stands in his booth] Great job, boys. You found the meth boss!"
1809,7,6,Gino and his goons,Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal.
1810,7,6,"Murphy, Jenkins, and Hopkins",[looks at his colleagues with suspicion] A deal?
1811,7,6,Murphy,"That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these ""super-cops"" joined the force. [the boys look stunned at the revelation: these cops are crooked]"
1812,7,6,Jenkins,Now we've gotta kill you all.
1813,7,6,"Murphy, Jenkins, and Hopkins",Boys! Down! [the boys look for cover as the two crooked cops join the five men in firing at Hopkins. The boys huddle under a table]
1814,7,6,DJ at Peppermint Hippo's,"Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca."
1815,7,6,Lt. Dawson,Christ! Those junior detectives have no regard for the law! [FBI trucks pull up and agents pour out of them]
1816,7,6,Lead FBI agent,Get me a hard line to the phone! And I want choppers on the roof!
1817,7,6,Lt. Dawson,[walks up] Who the hell are you??
1818,7,6,Lead FBI agent,"[whips out his badge] Agent Fields, FBI!"
1819,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation."
1820,7,6,"FBI Agents, led by Agent Fields","Not anymore, you're not."
1821,7,6,Lt. Dawson,But that's not fair!
1822,7,6,"FBI Agents, led by Agent Fields","Is so! Is so! [inside, the gunfight continues. Hopkins is shot, and he quickly kills two of Gino's men. Jenkins quickly shoots at Hopkins and gets the right arm. Hopkins winces and falls down]"
1823,7,6,Jenkins,"Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let anybody know about our partnership."
1824,7,6,Gino and his goons,"That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!"
1825,7,6,Murphy,That's right. [raises his gun and shoots Gino through the forehead. Gino's body slides down along the wall behind him] I think we'll take a hundred percent now.
1826,7,6,Jenkins,"Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business like this, sometimes partnerships need to end."
1827,7,6,Murphy,"That's right. [raises his gun and shoots Jenkins through the side of the head, and Jenkins wavers and falls] Sometimes partnerships need to end. [now seeing the boys] Well, super-cops, looks like I'll be taking in all the money now. I'm in business alone. And that means that the only person I can't trust... is myself. [raises the gun and shoots himself through his chin, then falls alongside Hopkins]"
1828,7,6,"Murphy, Jenkins, and Hopkins","[his arm in a sling] It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got what they deserved. If it weren't for you boys, we would have never cleaned up the department."
1829,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"[approaches the boys] All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight! I do not agree with your methods! You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent! But by God you get the job done. Congratulations!"
1830,7,6,Stan,Thanks.
1831,7,6,Lt. Dawson,"I'm probably going to regret this, but, well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. There'll be lots of action, and that big paycheck you've always wanted. [the paramedics close up the ambulance, then climb in and leave. The boys mull over the offer]"
1832,7,6,Stan,...I think I have a better idea.
1833,7,6,Kyle,"Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat."
1834,7,6,Stan,"[walks up with one of his outfits] Yes, I have a suit I need dry-cleaned, and pressed, please."
1835,7,6,Kyle,Certainly.
1836,7,6,Cartman,"[walks up with some clothes] Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five. [Kenny hands him a card] On your American Express."
1837,7,6,Butters,[coming down the stairs] Fellas! Hey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
1838,7,6,Cartman,You did?
1839,7,6,Butters,"Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out."
1840,7,6,Kyle,"That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners."
1841,7,6,Cartman,Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
1842,7,7,Stan,"Wow, dude."
1843,7,7,Cartman,"Man, Indians have it good, huh?"
1844,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect."
1845,7,7,Native American Chief,"Welcome to the Three Feathers Casino. I'm your host, Chief Runs With Premise. Please try your luck at one of our many games."
1846,7,7,Cartman,"[eagerly] All right, let's go! [moves forward]"
1847,7,7,Runs With Premise,Halt. [spreads his arms out] I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor.
1848,7,7,Cartman,"I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!"
1849,7,7,Runs With Premise,You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.
1850,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? [Stan shrugs and the boys leave. The adults move forward]"
1851,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"All right, time to win some money!"
1852,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Oh yeah! blackjack table!
1853,7,7,Blackjack Dealer,"Welcome to the blackjack table. May luck run through you, like the spirit of the buffalo."
1854,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, this is ten dollars a hand!"
1855,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Relax, sweetie [in hushed tones] I know how to count cards."
1856,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Well I don't wanna play here!
1857,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots."
1858,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. [smokes]"
1859,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"All right, time to show these people how to gamble!"
1860,7,7,Announcer,Welcome to the Three Feathers Comedy Club. Please put your hands together for Johnny Manymoons! [Johnny approaches the mic]
1861,7,7,Kyle,"What is Native American comedy, anyway?"
1862,7,7,Johnny Manymoons,"[takes the mic] Thank you, thank you. Bear walked into a bar. Bear said to Deer, ""May I please... have a drink?"" And so Deer said to Bear, ""Why the big paws?"" [the drums strikes three beats]"
1863,7,7,Native American Audience,Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! [the boys are confused]
1864,7,7,Johnny Manymoons,"Many moons ago, Pony and Eagle walked up to Coyote. Pony said to Coyote, ""I am very mad at Eagle. Will you yell at him for me?"" Coyote said to Pony, ""Why can you not yell yourself?"" And Pony replied, ""Because I am a little horse."" [the drums strikes three beats]"
1865,7,7,Native American Audience,Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
1866,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"How's it goin', Gerald?"
1867,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[nervous, fidgeting] Ohh, not so good."
1868,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks."
1869,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.
1870,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??"
1871,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem."
1872,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!"
1873,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
1874,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Where did you get that kind of money??
1875,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
1876,7,7,Blackjack Dealer,"Dealer, twenty one. [takes the last chip] Sorry."
1877,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[collapses on the table] That's it. I'm destitute. [leaps up and grabs Randy] Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup! [grabs the cup and tries to wrest it from Randy] Wha- what's in the cup?
1878,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[keeps the cup] Just six quarters!
1879,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[sits down and mopes] Oh God. Oh Jesus.
1880,7,7,Blackjack Dealer,Thank you for playing at Three Feathers. May your life be filled with the song of the sparrow.
1881,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[bolts upright again] Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!"
1882,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"How am I going to tell my family? [raises his head] How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? [Sheila and Sharon show up in the background with the boys.]"
1883,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,There's daddy!
1884,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[hangs his head] Oh, Jesus. [the boys and the women arrive.]"
1885,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
1886,7,7,Kyle,"Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go."
1887,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[raises his head] What, What did you say?"
1888,7,7,Kyle,I said I wanna leave.
1889,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[shifts gears and stands] Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! [Sheila and Kyle are baffled]"
1890,7,7,Kyle,"What?? No, no, I mean, I-"
1891,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!"
1892,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, what are you talking about?"
1893,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling a moving company right now! [leaves]"
1894,7,7,Cartman,"Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. [Kyle remains baffled, even as he looks at Cartman]"
1895,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[walks up to Randy] What's wrong with Gerald?
1896,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
1897,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
1898,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,They don't care. [the camera rises and focuses on a window behind them]
1899,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!
1900,7,7,Elder 1,Their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo.
1901,7,7,Elder 2,"[wearing glasses] Yes, but we have milked these simple mountain folk almost dry. If we really want to see cash flow, we need to bring in city-people from Denver."
1902,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","[turns around] Yeessss. It is time for us to implement our plan. [walks over to an easel on which sits a map of Colorado, with a new highway drawn on it between the casino and Denver] A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino!"
1903,7,7,Aide 1,And what do we do about the small town of South Park that lies in the highway's way?
1904,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","[holding up large stacks of bills] Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!"
1905,7,7,Native American Elders,Ha ha ha ha!
1906,7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway."
1907,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[rises] But how can they do that?!
1908,7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"The Native Americans have purchased the land out from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership."
1909,7,7,Jimbo,[rises] Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.
1910,7,7,Mayor McDaniels,The Native Americans bought the bank.
1911,7,7,Mr Garrison,Oh my God.
1912,7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes."
1913,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! [the town clamors in agreement]"
1914,7,7,Chef,[rises] Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! [the town clamors in agreement]
1915,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"How much do we have to raise, Mayor?"
1916,7,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Three hundred thousand dollars. [the town thinks, then grumbles]"
1917,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Ohhh, never mind. [sits down]"
1918,7,7,Butters,"How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?"
1919,7,7,Cartman,"Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!"
1920,7,7,Kyle,[correcting] Native Americans. [Stan rises and walks away from the building]
1921,7,7,Stan,"Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. [begins to reminisce]"
1922,7,7,Stan,"[stops reminiscing, turns around, and walks back to the boys] We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!"
1923,7,7,The boys,Yeah!
1924,7,7,Alex Glick,"Yeah, this is our town!"
1925,7,7,Stan,We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
1926,7,7,Kyle,Yeah!
1927,7,7,Butters,Yeah!
1928,7,7,Tweek,Yeah!
1929,7,7,Cartman,That's right!
1930,7,7,Butters,"Yeah, ahh, that's right!"
1931,7,7,Alex Glick,"Yeah, we're a team!"
1932,7,7,Stan,We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! [the boys start thinking]
1933,7,7,Cartman,"[rises and moves to the sidewalk] Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go! [trots off excitedly. The other boys just watch him leave. Cartman returns a few seconds later] No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?"
1934,7,7,Stan,We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
1935,7,7,Butters,"Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? [smiles]"
1936,7,7,Kyle,Dog parade?
1937,7,7,Butters,"Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street. [closes his eyes and beams] It'll be so adorable!"
1938,7,7,Kyle,How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
1939,7,7,Butters,"Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads."
1940,7,7,Stan,"Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!"
1941,7,7,Butters,Oh... [the boys go back to thinking]
1942,7,7,Cartman,"Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now."
1943,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!"
1944,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[walks up to the Chief] How can you do this to people?
1945,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits."
1946,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,There's more to life than profits!
1947,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Well like what?
1948,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. [more of the house is torn down]"
1949,7,7,Chris Stotch,"Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well."
1950,7,7,Mr Garrison,"Yeah. [begins to wave] So long, South Park."
1951,7,7,Stan,Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
1952,7,7,Chris Stotch,A dog parade? [smiles in anticipation]
1953,7,7,Stan,No!
1954,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow."
1955,7,7,Stan,"I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!"
1956,7,7,Kyle,"[opens a book he's carrying and reads] The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one. [looks up and closes the book] That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand."
1957,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Boys, that's ridiculous."
1958,7,7,Stan,"Look, we- we've got nothing to lose."
1959,7,7,Chef,What do you guys think?
1960,7,7,Jimbo,It's a long shot.
1961,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Yeah. [turns around and makes fists with determination] But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
1962,7,7,Runs With Premise,"[reading from a newspaper] The residents of South Park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars. but in the end managed to raise only ten. The loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of South Park. [fakes sadness] Awww, I think I'm going to cwy."
1963,7,7,Two Elders,HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha!
1964,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. [the adults begin to move past the boys]"
1965,7,7,Stan,Dad. [Randy turns around] Good luck.
1966,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"It's in God's hand now. [turns around and moves forward] Stand aside, everyone! [the adults move towards the roulette table. The Chief notices a change in atmosphere and rises to see what's going on from his office.]"
1967,7,7,Runs With Premise,What are they doing?
1968,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars! [sets the yellow chips down] On thirty one black! [moves the chips towards the number. Everyone gasps. The dealer takes the chips and puts them away, substituting some blue chips for the yellow ones.]"
1969,7,7,Runs With Premise,Impossible!
1970,7,7,Stan,[begins to wish hard] Come on! Come on! [the dealer starts the wheel and tosses the ball in the opposite direction. Everyone looks on in anticipation. The ball slows down and settles in on thirty one black.]
1971,7,7,Runs With Premise,Thirty one. Black. [the town erupts with joy]
1972,7,7,Townsfolk,Yeah! All right! Woohoo! Oh we did it! We did it! Oh my God! Oh this is amazing!
1973,7,7,Runs With Premise,No... NOOO! [The boys cheer. Cartman and Kenny hug]
1974,7,7,Alex Glick,South Park is saved. [the dealer adds more blue chips to the amount bet]
1975,7,7,Mr Mackey,We have plenty enough to save our town now!
1976,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah! But wait. [the rush of winning gets to him] Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! [the people gasp a bit at the possibility]"
1977,7,7,Mr Garrison,We can save the town and be super-rich!
1978,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!
1979,7,7,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Let it ride!!
1980,7,7,Townsfolk,"Woohoo! Yeah! [they stay with thirty one black, and the dealer spins again]"
1981,7,7,Kyle,What the hell are they doing??
1982,7,7,Jimbo,Let's go thirty one! Let's see it! [the ball bounces around and settles in on two red.]
1983,7,7,Roulette Dealer,"Two, red. You lose."
1984,7,7,Townsfolk,AWWWWWWW!!
1985,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Dammit!
1986,7,7,Runs With Premise,[satisfied with this result] Hmmm! [walks off]
1987,7,7,Stan,"They, they had it! They freakin' had it!"
1988,7,7,Stan,You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
1989,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
1990,7,7,Stan,A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
1991,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stan? Okay?
1992,7,7,Stan,What???
1993,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,All right? Stan? Okay?
1994,7,7,Stan,"You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! [Randy brakes the car angrily]"
1995,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[menacingly] Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?! [turns and faces Stan] Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians! [turns back to the wheel] I'm sorry, Native Americans."
1996,7,7,Elder 2,"[facing Mr. Garrison] There you are, sir. There's the check for your home. Just sign here, and here."
1997,7,7,Mr Garrison,"[signing] Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless."
1998,7,7,Mr Slave,[sobbing] Jesus! Jesus Christ!
1999,7,7,Stan,"[walks up to Randy, who is in line with the others] Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!"
2000,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes."
2001,7,7,Elder 3,"There you go. Have a nice day. [hands a check to Liane, who turns around and walks off with it]"
2002,7,7,Stan,"[walks with his friends to a clearing where he could be heard] Come on, you guys! This is our town!"
2003,7,7,Mr Mackey,"It's over, Stanley. What else can we do?"
2004,7,7,Stan,We can stay. And fight.
2005,7,7,Cartman,"Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!"
2006,7,7,Kenny,(Yeah!)
2007,7,7,Alex Glick,Yeah! They don't own our town! We do!
2008,7,7,Chef,"I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics."
2009,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over."
2010,7,7,Stan,"Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now! [the adults look back helplessly] Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! [the boys leave. Cartman stays behind.]"
2011,7,7,Cartman,You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! [follows his friends them out. The adults just watch]
2012,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Get out of our way.
2013,7,7,Stan,No! We won't let you destroy our town!
2014,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Boys. It isn't your town anymore.
2015,7,7,Stan,"Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life."
2016,7,7,Elder 1,"Well your way of life is about to change, little boys. Now move! [points the way to the side of the street]"
2017,7,7,Kyle,You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
2018,7,7,A Driver,"And what are four little boys going to do to stop us, huh? [the boys stand unsure, but a sound rises up behind them. Townsfolk appear in mass and walk down the street.]"
2019,7,7,Townsfolk,"We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
[Stan looks behind him, smiles, then looks up to his left. People now appear on the roofs of the buildings as well as on the street.]
Searching our hearts for so lohh-oo-ohh-oo-ong
[Stan looks at the roofs on the other side of the street, smiling.]
All of us knowing...
[The boys grin]
Love Is A Battlefield"
2020,7,7,Stan,This land is not for sale.
2021,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with!
2022,7,7,Elder 1,They were!
2023,7,7,Mr Garrison,"Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!"
2024,7,7,Principal Victoria,Filthy bastard Native American money!
2025,7,7,Mr Garrison,"Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that."
2026,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",This isn't over! [he and the others get into their bulldozers and pull out of town]
2027,7,7,Jimbo,We'll never give up! You bastards!
2028,7,7,Alex Glick,Yeah! South Park is ours.
2029,7,7,Mr Mackey,"But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever."
2030,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"We can stand here as long as it takes. [no one moves. The scene stays for a few seconds, then...]"
2031,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",What is the state of our people?
2032,7,7,Elder 2,"Last night I spoke with the spirit of the bear, and Bear said that if we do not build our highway soon, our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino."
2033,7,7,Elder 1,"Yes, and Eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day."
2034,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land.
2035,7,7,Elder 1,"But they are determined and proud. And the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force, it could be a publicity nightmare, further hurting our net assets."
2036,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",I already have a plan how we can force them off their land... sneakily. [begins to move off] We're going to give them... [stops in front of a wall] blankets. [three of them are shown]
2037,7,7,Elder 1,Blankets?
2038,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS. [his fellow tribespeople look at each other] They will all get SARS! And then SARS will run through their town like a buffalo. Now I need your help getting the SARS onto the blankets. [everyone puts on their little white face masks] Okay, bring them in!"
2039,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",[The office doors open and several naked Chinese men are brought in] Let's see how South Park deals with this! [he picks up one of the men and rubs him on a blanket. The Chinese man looks at him bewildered] Everyone grab a Chinese person and rub them on a blanket. [other elders pick up the other Chinese them and carry them over to other blankets hanging on the wall] Make sure you rub them all over. Get the SARS nice and deep in there. [the Chinese men grumble at their treatment]
2040,7,7,Announcers and Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too. [a Three Casinos Humvee rolls into town and four elders, including Runs with Premise, exit the vehicle]"
2041,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[looking on suspiciously, huddled with his family] What do they want?"
2042,7,7,Mr Garrison,"We're not moving, ass-faces!"
2043,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","[walks up to Mr. Garrison with a blanket] Free blanket? [presents it to him] Though I know we have differences, we believe that a compromise can be reached. In the meantime, it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold. Will you not take this offering as a gesture of good-will?"
2044,7,7,Mr Garrison,"You had me at ""free blanket."" [Runs with Premise nods and Garrison takes the blanket and opens it. Runs with Premise moves on to other townsfolk and the other elders join in, passing out blankets to the townsfolk.]"
2045,7,7,Native American Elders,Free blanket? Free blanket? Free blanket...
2046,7,7,Announcers and Field Reporter,"Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of good-will towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it."
2047,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",[walks up to Randy] Please. As a token of good faith.
2048,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
2049,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh."
2050,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Well, thanks. [takes the blanket and opens it up. The Chief walks away]"
2051,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Oh. You're welcome.
2052,7,7,Announcers and Field Reporter,"[leaning to his left] Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and the outbreak of SARS in South Park has reached epic proportions. [coughs twice and sniffs] The entire town has been quarantined by the federal government, nobody allowed in our out, which means, nobody can come to our aid. [sniffs twice] It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for. Coming up next, choosing the right hair conditioner. What you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle."
2053,7,7,Stan,"It's all right, dad."
2054,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,How's your... mother?
2055,7,7,Stan,"[looks over] She's hanging in there. [looks at Randy again] Here, drink some beer. [Randy turns his head aside a bit so he can take a sip, then resets his head]"
2056,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,It's cool on my tongue.
2057,7,7,Stan,You're gonna be all right.
2058,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live."
2059,7,7,Stan,"No, Dad, NO."
2060,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us. [coughs and sniffs] Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. [runs out of air, then turns aside and breathes in. His voice turns raspy]"
2061,7,7,Stan,What can I do?
2062,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people."
2063,7,7,Stan,"Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!"
2064,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellow Creek. Now go. GO! [Stan steps away, then runs. Randy relaxes and lays down]"
2065,7,7,Wise Man in Trailer Park,[answers the door] What?
2066,7,7,Stan,"Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-"
2067,7,7,Wise Man in Trailer Park,Your coming was foretold to me. You've come to save our people. Come in. [steps aside and Stan enters] Watch the cats.
2068,7,7,Stan,"Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?"
2069,7,7,Wise Man in Trailer Park,"Me?? Huh, no. I am just a guide. Sit down."
2070,7,7,Wise Man in Trailer Park,"You must find the answer yourself, by taking an inward journey. [picks up a can of paint thinner and pours it into a brown paper bag]"
2071,7,7,Stan,An inward journey? That sounds kinda gay.
2072,7,7,Wise Man in Trailer Park,"Let the voices of our ancestors show you the way. [offers the bag to Stan] Breathe. Breathe from the bag of visions. [Stan takes the bag, looks at it, then takes a deep breath from it]"
2073,7,7,Stan,"[disgusted] Ah! Oh, dude!"
2074,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",How much longer must we wait for our superhighway??
2075,7,7,Elder 1,"SARS has spread throughout the entire town of South Park, Chief Runs with Premise. Their wills will break soon."
2076,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Then I suppose we must be patient.
2077,7,7,Woman,"Runs with Premise, come quickly!"
2078,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","What is the matter, wife?"
2079,7,7,Woman,"It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick."
2080,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","Premise Running Thin, what is the matter?"
2081,7,7,Woman,"He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!"
2082,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",No! I told you not to touch them!
2083,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",Papa. Papa...
2084,7,7,Medicine Man,[wearing a wolf skin over his head and back] I have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life. But nothing seems to be working.
2085,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",This would not have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe!
2086,7,7,Stan,Dad! Dad!
2087,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
2088,7,7,Stan,"Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS. [reaches into the bag and pulls out each item as he names it] Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite."
2089,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! [a few hours later, everyone is standing around enjoying the soup, soda, and medicine prescribed, and chatting]"
2090,7,7,Kyle,"Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for."
2091,7,7,Alex Glick,"Thanks to you, we're all safe now, Stan."
2092,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth! [the townsfolk look at the coming vehicles and slowly close ranks] What the? [thinks quickly] Wait a minute. [to his men] Stop! Stop! [hops off the bulldozer and walks up to the people] Your, your SARS. Where did it go?"
2093,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
2094,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin",My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well. [makes a truce sign with his hands] You... you can cure him?
2095,7,7,Elder 1,It is amazing. All our plants and herbs failed to heal him.
2096,7,7,Elder 2,But your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart. Perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life.
2097,7,7,Randy and Sharon Marsh,We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
2098,7,7,"Chief Runs with Premise, wife, and Premise Running Thin","You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino. [his wife nudges him with her elbow a few times and he gets irritated] All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back."
2099,7,7,Townsfolk,All right! Yeah! [townspeople jump and cheer. Sheila and Gerald hug each other.] Woohoo!
2100,7,7,Alex Glick,"Well, I guess we all learned that South Park is more than just a town. It's a community that nobody can split up."
2101,7,7,Stan,"Dude, who the hell are you?"
2102,7,7,Alex Glick,Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and do the guest voice thingy.
2103,7,7,Kyle,What?! Get the hell out of here!
2104,7,7,Alex Glick,Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Jill!
2105,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night."
2106,7,8,Eric Cartman,What? Tell us?
2107,7,8,Stan Marsh,"So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top."
2108,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!"
2109,7,8,Stan Marsh,I know!
2110,7,8,Kenny McCormick,(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
2111,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll."
2112,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[joins them, but dressed as usual] Hey dudes. [the others glance at him]"
2113,7,8,Eric Cartman,[begins to laugh at him] What a dork!
2114,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2115,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! [laughs heartily]"
2116,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear."
2117,7,8,Stan Marsh,"You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend."
2118,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. [Stan inspects Kyle's jacket]"
2119,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??"
2120,7,8,Eric Cartman,"We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys."
2121,7,8,Kenny McCormick,(That's the truth.)
2122,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! [the boys excitedly pull Kyle along to South Park Mall]"
2123,7,8,Singers Widelife,"You... came into my life... and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
It's true. You bring out the best in me.
When you are around, when you are around, all things just keep getting better.
It keeps getting better. Life keeps getting better and better (All things just keep getting better)."
2124,7,8,Announcer,"Coming up on HBC, it's Queer Eye for the Straight Guy!"
2125,7,8,Carson,[a shot of Queer Eye...] We have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts!
2126,7,8,Announcer,"[the night's schedule pops up over the scene] Then it's Boy Meets Boy, followed by Will and Grace, and then, the Love Boat... with Men."
2127,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,"My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days."
2128,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. [the door opens and the four newly-clothed boys enter]
2129,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[waves] Hi Mom, Hi Dad!"
2130,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,[looks and jumps to his feet] HAAAAAA!!! [walks over to Kyle] Kyle! What's happened to you??
2131,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! [leads the others boys out of the living room]"
2132,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh my God! Come on, Sheila! [she rises] We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! [they leave.]"
2133,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh hi Gerald, Sheila."
2134,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys."
2135,7,8,Sharon Marsh,Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
2136,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, is the game on or something? [they move towards the sofa, where a bunch of the men are watching]"
2137,7,8,Randy Marsh,[moves over to Gerald and hugs him] Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! [the other men greet him as well]
2138,7,8,Other Men,Geraaald! Hi Gerald.
2139,7,8,Stuart McCormick,"Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on."
2140,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? [the other men laugh]
2141,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual."
2142,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,What's that?
2143,7,8,Skeeter,Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.
2144,7,8,Stuart McCormick,"Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture."
2145,7,8,Randy Marsh,It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
2146,7,8,Sharon Marsh,Don't our men look
2147,7,8,Linda Stotch,"Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best."
2148,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,It is?
2149,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures."
2150,7,8,Linda Stotch,And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
2151,7,8,Sarah Swanson,"My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. Oooh, I love it!"
2152,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever."
2153,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
2154,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!"
2155,7,8,Eric Cartman,"That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us."
2156,7,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!!)
2157,7,8,Stan Marsh,"All right. Let's work it! [shimmies a bit. The boys turn and pass through the entrance, but stop in their tracks.] What the...?"
2158,7,8,Butters Stotch,"Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classes."
2159,7,8,Connor,"Okay, sweetums. [they part ways. Butters goes off to his right. Farther away, near the drinking fountains, stand Timmy, Jimmy, Kevin, and Pip]"
2160,7,8,Clyde Donovan,"Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! [turns right and follows after Butters. The boys look on in stunned silence]"
2161,7,8,A Boy,"Hey dudes. [the boys look and it's Craig with Token, Jason, and Tweek]"
2162,7,8,Stan Marsh,Hey Craig.
2163,7,8,Craig Tucker,You guys look pretty gay.
2164,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,[happily] Thanks.
2165,7,8,Craig Tucker,"[him and his group are not happy about it] Not as gay as us, though."
2166,7,8,Eric Cartman,"[moves in front of Kyle] Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!"
2167,7,8,Craig Tucker,Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!
2168,7,8,Eric Cartman,Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
2169,7,8,Chef,"[arrives] What's all this fightin' about, children?!"
2170,7,8,Stan Marsh,These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
2171,7,8,Chef,"Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too."
2172,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!"
2173,7,8,Chef,"No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!"
2174,7,8,Stan Marsh,We're metrosexual!!
2175,7,8,Craig Tucker,"Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! [snaps his fingers and his group follows him away]"
2176,7,8,Eric Cartman,"GOD I HATE CRAIG!! [Stan and Kenny turn to leave] That son of a... djah!! [leaves. Kyle turns to leave, but has second thoughts.]"
2177,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual."
2178,7,8,Chef,"Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool."
2179,7,8,Mr Garrison,"All right children, let's take our seats."
2180,7,8,Class,"[in unison] Good morning Mr. Garrison. [their dulcet tones get his attention, and he turns around]"
2181,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, uh d-don't you all look nice."
2182,7,8,Timmy Burch,"[responds, gestures gaily with his hands] Oooo, Timmy. [the door opens and Kyle enters. A closeup of the boys as Kyle goes to his seat]"
2183,7,8,Stan Marsh,Dude! W-what are you doing?
2184,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me."
2185,7,8,Craig Tucker,HA! Told you you guys were straight!
2186,7,8,Stan Marsh,We're not straight! You're straight!
2187,7,8,Jason,You're straight!
2188,7,8,Craig Tucker,You're straight!
2189,7,8,Tweek Tweak,You're straight!
2190,7,8,Token Black,You're straight!
2191,7,8,Eric Cartman,You're straight like a freeway!
2192,7,8,Mr Garrison,What the hell is going on??
2193,7,8,Eric Cartman,"You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!"
2194,7,8,Craig Tucker,"I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny stay silent, looking at each other]"
2195,7,8,Eric Cartman,...So? I'm half bisexual!
2196,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!"
2197,7,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi."
2198,7,8,Mr Garrison,WHAT??
2199,7,8,Mr Garrison,"It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. [they cross the cross street and enter the bar at the corner]"
2200,7,8,Mr Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ."
2201,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Look at that, Mr. Slave. [a pan shot of the people there. He puts his hands over his mouth] Our cup runneth over."
2202,7,8,Mr Slave,[puts his right hand over his mouth] Jesus Christ.
2203,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"[standing with Ned at the bar] Mr. Garrison, those are great pants."
2204,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too. [cuddles up to him] Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?"
2205,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"Uh, for what?"
2206,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, you know..."
2207,7,8,Jimbo Kern,No.
2208,7,8,Mr Garrison,Huh.
2209,7,8,Randy Marsh,Mr. Garrison! [Garrison and Slave walk over] Hey doll.
2210,7,8,Mr Garrison,Oh hey Randy.
2211,7,8,Randy Marsh,You're looking ultra-fabulous.
2212,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well thanks. You too. [leans in a bit] So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?"
2213,7,8,Randy Marsh,"[turns his back to Mr. Garrison and walks away] Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that."
2214,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Not, not like that?"
2215,7,8,Richard Tweak,"[approaches, carries some glasses of wine] How about some shirazz, guys? [Garrison and Slave each take a glass]"
2216,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Uh-Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek."
2217,7,8,Richard Tweak,"My pleasure, silly-buns."
2218,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, wuh, well uh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place."
2219,7,8,Richard Tweak,Why?
2220,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass."
2221,7,8,Mr Slave,"Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ."
2222,7,8,Richard Tweak,"Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight."
2223,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!"
2224,7,8,Patrons,Huh?
2225,7,8,Mr Garrison,Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!
2226,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, we don't ""pound butt,"" Mr. Garrison, we're straight."
2227,7,8,Mr Garrison,Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
2228,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt."
2229,7,8,Mr Garrison,"No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!"
2230,7,8,Skeeter,"So, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now."
2231,7,8,Patrons,Yeah.
2232,7,8,Mr Garrison,One of you?! [throws his glass down] We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
2233,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp."
2234,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Wow, is that from Origins?"
2235,7,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
2236,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,[approaches with a football] Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
2237,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second? [pulls Stan and Kenny away from Kyle] Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle."
2238,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, what can we do about it?"
2239,7,8,Eric Cartman,"We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle."
2240,7,8,Stan Marsh,What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
2241,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore."
2242,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Wait, what?"
2243,7,8,Eric Cartman,"You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy."
2244,7,8,Craig Tucker,"[approaches with his friends] Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. [they laugh at him]"
2245,7,8,Token Black,"When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? [Kyle picks up his football]"
2246,7,8,Jason,"Yeah, let's see that hair. [lifts up Kyle's hat] Look, he's not even using any product! [he and the others laugh at him. Other boys gather in and join in the laughter]"
2247,7,8,Stan Marsh,"[returns with Cartman and Kenny] Hey, what's goin' on?"
2248,7,8,Craig Tucker,"Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!"
2249,7,8,Eric Cartman,He's not our friend. [Stan's jaw drops a bit. Cartman looks at Stan and walks away. Kenny follows]
2250,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan? [Stan looks at Kyle, sighs, and walks away]"
2251,7,8,Jason,"[shoves Kyle a bit] This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!"
2252,7,8,Craig Tucker,Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! [the other boys gather round Kyle and gang up on him]
2253,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,No! Ah!
2254,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,[sees him and drops her duster to kneel next to him] Kyle! What happened to you?!
2255,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,[sniffs] I got beat up at school... for being different.
2256,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
2257,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,No! For not being a metrosexual.
2258,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald! Gerald, get down here!"
2259,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[upstairs. Disco music plays] Here I come! [dances down the stairs, then moonwalks right back up, then strikes a pose.]"
2260,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
2261,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,Kyle! You look terrible! [walks down and approaches him]
2262,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,"The boys at school beat him up, Gerald."
2263,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look."
2264,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Gah! Just leave me alone! [walks away and passes the TV]
2265,7,8,A voice,There you go! Now you look fabulous.
2266,7,8,Kyan,You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.
2267,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,GRRRRR!!
2268,7,8,"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy

 Kyan
 Carson
 Jai
 Thom",Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps. [the straight man smiles]
2269,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,That does it! I know what I have to do! [walks off]
2270,7,8,Chef,"Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison."
2271,7,8,Mr Garrison,"[sadly] Chef, can I talk to you?"
2272,7,8,Chef,Sure. Come on in.
2273,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Thanks. Come, Slave. [yanks Mr. Slave in by a leash around his neck. Both men sit on Chef's couch. Mr. Slave buries his face in his hands] Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!"
2274,7,8,Mr Slave,[sobs] Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!
2275,7,8,Chef,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?"
2276,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?"
2277,7,8,Chef,"Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them."
2278,7,8,Mr Slave,[straightens up] How did you do that?
2279,7,8,Chef,"Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, ""I'm in the house"" instead of ""I'm here."" But then white people all started to say ""in the house"" so we switched it to ""in the hizzouse."" Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then ""in the hizzle"" which we had to change to ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" and now, because white people say ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" we have to say ""flippity floppity floop."""
2280,7,8,Mr Garrison,"[slumps forward] We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing. [thinks] Wait. [rises] That's it! I know exactly what to do! [yanks on Mr. Slave's leash] Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. [exits the front door with Mr. Slave]"
2281,7,8,Chef,Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! [the door closes]
2282,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"One ticket to New York, please."
2283,7,8,South Park Train Station Clerk,[handing a ticket over] You're going to New York alone?
2284,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
2285,7,8,South Park Train Station Clerk,"Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes."
2286,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Mrrh.
2287,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Garrison?
2288,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Kyle, what are you doing here?"
2289,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
2290,7,8,Mr Garrison,What?? That's what I'm doing!
2291,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
2292,7,8,Mr Garrison,They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
2293,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,I thought of it first!
2294,7,8,Mr Garrison,No you didn't! No you didn't!
2295,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Did so! Did so!
2296,7,8,Mr Garrison,I thought of it yesterday!
2297,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,I thought of it two days ago!
2298,7,8,Mr Garrison,I thought of it before you were born!
2299,7,8,Mr Slave,"Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?"
2300,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh. [sigh] You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together."
2301,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cool.
2302,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Wow, we look great!"
2303,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now."
2304,7,8,Randy Marsh,Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men! [leaves. The boys follow him out. Randy calls out to the other men in the mall] Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! [their wives sit on benches in the center of the mall with nothing to do]
2305,7,8,Richard Tweak,Oh my God!
2306,7,8,Man,Let's go! Let's go!
2307,7,8,Ryan Swanson,[walking down the far side of the mall] You guys have got to see these shoes I bought!
2308,7,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!"
2309,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!"
2310,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great."
2311,7,8,Linda Stotch,I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
2312,7,8,Mrs Tweek,I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.
2313,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show! [the guys cheer]"
2314,7,8,Carson,What can I say? We're fabulous.
2315,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"You guys are changing the world! And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States!"
2316,7,8,Jai,"Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint. [a knock is heard at the door, then it opens]"
2317,7,8,Mr Garrison,Room service. [a service cart rolls in]
2318,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,What? We didn't order any room service.
2319,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up."
2320,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Carol? [lifts the platter's lid for a brief peek, then lowers it] Well, I'll have to check on this. Excuse me a minute, fellas. [leaves. Mr. Garrison continues inside the office when the coast is clear. He takes the cart to the desk and parks it there. Kyle pops out and rushes to lock the door]"
2321,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Clear!
2322,7,8,Mr Garrison,"[whips out his walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Okay, Mr. Slave! [From a nearby building Mr. Slave swings down like Spiderman and crashes through the window, but passes out on impact. His body collapses on the floor]"
2323,7,8,Mr Slave,"Unh, Jesus [a chunk of window falls onto his ass] Christ."
2324,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Well crap, that didn't work."
2325,7,8,Stan Marsh,"You'd better shut up, Craig."
2326,7,8,Craig Tucker,Everyone knows it's true!
2327,7,8,Stan Marsh,It is not!
2328,7,8,Craig Tucker,Is so!
2329,7,8,Tom,Craig! Behave yourself!
2330,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?"
2331,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!"
2332,7,8,Randy Marsh,"What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about."
2333,7,8,Tom,Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.
2334,7,8,Randy Marsh,Oh really?!
2335,7,8,Tom,"I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman."
2336,7,8,Men,Ooooo.
2337,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare."
2338,7,8,Other men,"Oh no, errrr!"
2339,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?! [the men fall silent] Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!"
2340,7,8,Tom,You don't... like us being metrosexual?
2341,7,8,The Women,NO!
2342,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!"
2343,7,8,The Males,Yeah!!
2344,7,8,Linda Stotch,What?
2345,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!"
2346,7,8,Sharon Marsh,This is crazy!
2347,7,8,Randy Marsh,"[steps forward, past the boys] Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!"
2348,7,8,Tom,"[steps forward, past the boys] You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!"
2349,7,8,Craig Tucker,"[steps forward, past his father] Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are."
2350,7,8,Eric Cartman,"[steps forward] That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade."
2351,7,8,Ryan Swanson,"Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!"
2352,7,8,Stuart McCormick,We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
2353,7,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoohoo!)
2354,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!"
2355,7,8,The Males,Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets!
2356,7,8,Mrs Tweek,What the hell did that show do to them?
2357,7,8,Officer Barbrady,You sure you don't want to press charges?
2358,7,8,Kyan,"That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong."
2359,7,8,Carson,Especially in those pants.
2360,7,8,Mr Garrison,"[the cops leave] Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!"
2361,7,8,Jai,Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!
2362,7,8,Mr Garrison,"But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left."
2363,7,8,Kyan,"Sorry Charlie, no sale. [he and the others turn and walk away]"
2364,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Buh... but... this doesn't make sense! [grabs his head] How can gay men do this to their own people?? [the Queer Eye guys reach the exit] Unless... you're not gay at all... [the guys stop, turn around, look at Garrison angrily, then return]"

 Thom","You just had to push it, didn't you?!"
2366,7,8,Jai,Just had to keep asking question!
2367,7,8,Carson,[locks the exit] Now you know the truth!
2368,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,They aren't gay? Then what are they?
2369,7,8,Kyan,For a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished by man in the Kindling Wars.
2370,7,8,Mr Garrison,Oh my God. [Kyan steps forward and begins to crumble. A walking crab pops out]
2371,7,8,Leader,We are the Crab People!
2372,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
2373,7,8,Mr Slave,Jesus Christ!

2377,7,8,Mr Garrison,"Gone?? [""Crab People! Crab People!""]"
2378,7,8,Crab Man 2,"Crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force, and so we came up with our perfect plan! [another crab person walks over to a closet full of human shells, all of them replicas of the Queer Eye guys. The crab person climbs in a Carson replica and closes the shell behind him. Carson's replica comes to life]"
2379,7,8,Carson replica,"If you can't beat man, [drops down from his hook] change man!"
2380,7,8,Mr Garrison,I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! [some crab people restrain him and Mr. Slave]
2381,7,8,Crab Leader,"When all the world is metrosexual, the crab people shall finally reign supreme!! [raises his pincers and claps. The other crab people join him and clap]"

2386,7,8,Crab Man 2,"[approaches] Very well. If we can't make you into metrosexuals, then we will make you into crab people! Take them!! [the crab people swarm in and separate the hostages. Some of them take Kyle into Crabwear and select a crab outfit for him to wear. Then they take him to Crab Salon and put antennae on his hat, then they take him to get a facial, then they march him down the underground road]"

We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]

2393,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! [leads the ladies away. Randy's float hits a pothole and veers to the right. It hits the sushi restaurant as the spectators back away quickly]"
2394,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"Whoa, look out! [the float hits the building and breaks a window. A small fire is heard]"
2395,7,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, it's on fire! [the men jump out of the float and run to the other side of the street]"
2396,7,8,Skeeter,Put it out! Put it out!
2397,7,8,Randy Marsh,I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
2398,7,8,Skeeter,The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!

2400,7,8,Jimbo Kern,"[the float and building are now fully engulfed in flames] Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!"
2401,7,8,Skeeter,Eeeek!
2402,7,8,Randy Marsh,Put it out! Put it out! Fire!
2403,7,8,Carson,"Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over!"

2407,7,8,Mr Garrison,Stop them! They're crab people!
2408,7,8,Crab Man 3,"They cannot see or hear us, foolish man. Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helpless!!"
2409,7,8,Carson,"That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket. [Kyan, Jai, and Thom remove the President's coat and Carson hands him the jacket]"
2410,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,No Mr. President!! Don't do it! [the crab man holding him quickly covers his mouth] Help!
2411,7,8,Mr Garrison,You bastards!
2412,7,8,Kyan,"That looks great! Now, how about some moisturizer. [Bush and the guys smile. The studio door bursts open and the women flood into the studio wielding bats]"
2413,7,8,Sharon Marsh,There they are! Get 'em!
2414,7,8,Kyan,What? [their smiles vanish]
2415,7,8,Linda Stotch,You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
2416,7,8,Sarah Swanson,It's payback time! [the women rush in and start beating up the Queer Eye guys]

2418,7,8,Crab Man 3,Oh noooo!! [Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave react and crack the crab people in two in the booth as the women finish Queer Eye guys off below]
2419,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,[kneeling at the corpses of Carson and Kyan] Wha? What have you done?
2420,7,8,Sharon Marsh,"We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't."
2421,7,8,Linda Stotch,"That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to."
2422,7,8,Sarah Swanson,"We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys."
2423,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Well you're going to jail for thi-! [Kyan's body begins to move, and the HoP looks down] Wait a minute. [a crab man crawls out] What is that?"
2424,7,8,Crab Leader,No! Our evil plans! Noooo... [dies]
2425,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,Oh my God. They were crab people.
2426,7,8,Mr Garrison,[enters the studio with Slave and Kyle in tow] Yes! They were trying to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
2427,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,Mom!
2428,7,8,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle!
2429,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,I should have known they were crab people. They tried this before with The Jefferson.
2430,7,8,Mr Garrison,"So now, can you please change your network's programming?"
2431,7,8,HBC Head of Programming,"Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad."
2432,7,8,Randy Marsh,Hey eses.
2433,7,8,Stuart McCormick,Hey hefe. You want some cerveza? [hands Randy a beer.]
2434,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?"
2435,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
2436,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. It's cool, holmes."
2437,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?"
2438,7,8,Stan Marsh,"Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. [turns and walks away]"
2439,7,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! [turns and walks away. Kenny just looks at him and walks off. Kyle looks away, then back at the boys, then walks away in the opposite direction. He stops, thinks for a while, then turns around and hurries to them]"
2440,7,8,Kyle Broflovski,God-damnit!
2441,7,9,Cartman,God dammit! [hangs his head and lets the mic stand fall into his left hand. All stop playing and the side door opens]
2442,7,9,Randy Marsh,"[looks in] Stan, are you okay?"
2443,7,9,Stan,"Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. [Cartman straightens up]"
2444,7,9,Randy Marsh,"Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. [steps back and closes the door]"
2445,7,9,Cartman,[cackling] Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
2446,7,9,Kyle,"He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz."
2447,7,9,Kenny,(What? Is it?)
2448,7,9,Stan,"Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. [Cartman paces the floor with arms behind his back]"
2449,7,9,Kyle,I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
2450,7,9,Cartman,"[stops] Inspiration. Wait a minute, [turns right and walks away from them] that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?"
2451,7,9,Stan,See what?
2452,7,9,Cartman,[turns around] Our band should play Christian rock! [beams with pride]
2453,7,9,Kyle,Christian rock?!
2454,7,9,Cartman,"[races back to the band] Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!"
2455,7,9,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!"
2456,7,9,Cartman,"[protests, takes a step towards Kyle] It worked for Creed!"
2457,7,9,Stan,I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
2458,7,9,Cartman,"[steps towards Stan] You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!"
2459,7,9,Kyle,"[pointing to an exit] Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!"
2460,7,9,Cartman,Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
2461,7,9,Kyle,"You're on, fat boy!"
2462,7,9,Cartman,"Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! [runs out as fast as his fat little body will let him, and pants]"
2463,7,9,Kyle,[after a few seconds of watching the door] What a stupid asshole!
2464,7,9,Cartman,Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! [runs up to a house and pounds on the front door. The door opens up and it's Butters who answers]
2465,7,9,Butters,"Oh, hi Eric."
2466,7,9,Cartman,"Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! [dashes off]"
2467,7,9,Butters,[watching Cartman run off] ...Ohhh!
2468,7,9,Cartman,No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle! [pounds on the door and Token answers] Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! [turns around and dashes off]
2469,7,9,Token,What?! We don't have a bass guitar.
2470,7,9,Cartman,"[spins around] Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! [runs off. Token gets annoyed and shuts the door]"
2471,7,9,Butters,"Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... inspiration."
2472,7,9,Cartman,"Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. [makes changes to the sheet music on the piano's sheet music holder]"
2473,7,9,Token,"[arrives with a bass and a small amplifier] Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement."
2474,7,9,Cartman,"I told you, Token."
2475,7,9,Token,"So, what are we doing?"
2476,7,9,Cartman,"Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives."
2477,7,9,Butters,Wow!
2478,7,9,Cartman,We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
2479,7,9,Butters,[his smile vanishes and he slumps in his chair] Awww.
2480,7,9,Token,[moves towards the front door] I'm out. [picks up his amp]
2481,7,9,Cartman,"Wait! [Token stops, Cartman rushes over] Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- [points to Butters]"
2482,7,9,Butters,"Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars."
2483,7,9,Cartman,"Still want to leave, Token? [Token thinks a bit, then resumes his place] Thank you."
2484,7,9,Kyle,"[enters and stands before them] Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?"
2485,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
2486,7,9,Kyle,Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
2487,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already."
2488,7,9,Kyle,Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
2489,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,It wasn't your life yesterday. [resumes reading]
2490,7,9,Kyle,"Hold it. [plaintive] Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops."
2491,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"The answer is no, Kyle."
2492,7,9,Kyle,"Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!"
2493,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, don't belittle your own people!"
2494,7,9,Kyle,[turns and walks off in frustration] Aaaargh! [heads for the front door and opens it. Stan and Kenny approach the entrance. It's night out.]
2495,7,9,Stan,Hey dude.
2496,7,9,Kyle,It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
2497,7,9,Stan,"No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!"
2498,7,9,Kyle,Really?
2499,7,9,Kenny,(Yeah!)
2500,7,9,Stan,You got a computer?
2501,7,9,Stan,"See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!"
2502,7,9,Kyle,"All right, cool. [takes over] Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. [with each name, he clicks on some songs and a download indicator shows download progress for each one. It's an extremely fast connection]"
2503,7,9,Kenny,(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
2504,7,9,Stan,"Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too."
2505,7,9,Kyle,"[types in the search box] Judas Priest. [a two-tone bell sound indicates a successful download] Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! [immediately, helicopters are heard coming and the light outside turns bright white. A night sun hovers overhead and stops at a position in which the helicopter pilots can see inside the den. Police sirens are then heard]"
2506,7,9,Stan,What the hell is that?
2507,7,9,Kyle,"I don't know. [drops from the bench and walks over to a window] Let me go check. [an FBI agent crashes through the window, falls and rolls into a standing position, then aims his firearm at the boys. The boys are startled and jump]"
2508,7,9,Agent 1,Freeze!! FBI!! [a second agent crashes through the other window and rolls into position as well. A third agent leaps in through the second window]
2509,7,9,Agent 2,Down on the ground! Down on the ground! [the boys are herded closer together. Three thumps are heard on the door and more agents break in with a battering ram.]
2510,7,9,Agent 3,Hurry up! Let me see those hands! [the boys quickly raise their hands as more agents pour in. The boys are handcuffed]
2511,7,9,Agent 2,[into his walkie-talkie] Tango Teamus to Point Bravo! Suspects in custody! [the boys are escorted out of the room]
2512,7,9,Agent 4,"Move move move move move move! All clear, men! [to the boys] Get your ass going!"
2513,7,9,Agent 5,Move move move move move move! Move!
2514,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[appears at the door with Sheila] Kyle, what did you do?!"
2515,7,9,Kyle,[being herded into an FBI van with the other boys] I don't know!
2516,7,9,Cartman,"All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them. [some sheet music is shown. Cartman has already crossed out the original author's name] See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with [writes next to ""baby""] Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat. [Butters doesn't understand, but starts drumming. It's rather good] Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line."
2517,7,9,Token,I don't know how to play bass. [Butters stops]
2518,7,9,Cartman,"[Sighs, has his left fist on his forehead, eyes shut] Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass."
2519,7,9,Token,I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
2520,7,9,Cartman,"Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! [Token begins to play a bass line, then is surprised that he can actually do it, then realizes that Cartman is right]"
2521,7,9,Token,God-damnit! [Butters joins in and their sounds flow together]
2522,7,9,Cartman,"All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. [begins to sing]
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus."
2523,7,9,Butters,Well done!
2524,7,9,Kyle,"[some seconds later] Um, sir-"
2525,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"Shut up!! [the boys jump in their seats, then look down, chagrined] You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downloaded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?"
2526,7,9,Kyle,[rubs the table a bit] We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
2527,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,[pissed off] Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your coats on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!
2528,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica. [they approach a bush] Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool. [he's seen sitting on the edge of a chaise longue, his face in his hands, softly sobbing]"
2529,7,9,Kyle,What's the matter with him?
2530,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it."
2531,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"[a close-up of Lars sobbing] Come. There's more. [leads them away. Next seen is a small airport at night] Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything? [a shot of Britney boarding a plane, then stopping to look at it before entering] Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free. [Britney gives a heavy sigh and goes inside.] The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?"
2532,7,9,Kyle,"We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh..."
2533,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"That is the folly of man. Now look in this window. [they are at another mansion, and they look inside a picture window] Here you see the loving family of Master P. [He's shown tossing a basketball to his wife while his kid tries to catch it] Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia. [his mom lowers the ball and gives it to the boy, who smiles, picks it up and drops it. It rolls away and he goes after it]"
2534,7,9,Kyle,"So, he's gonna get it, right?"
2535,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise."
2536,7,9,Stan,"[apologetically] We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!"
2537,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"[somberly, dramatically] Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury."
2538,7,9,Cartman,"Almost there, you guys."
2539,7,9,Butters,Ow...
2540,7,9,Token,Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
2541,7,9,Cartman,"Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover. [sets up his camera on a tripod] The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover."
2542,7,9,Butters,"Wow, neato! An album cover! [walks out onto the sand]"
2543,7,9,Token,"[follows Butters onto the sand] This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!"
2544,7,9,Cartman,"[when Token seems out of earshot] I'm going to kill you one day, Token."
2545,7,9,Token,[spins around] What did you say?! [Cartman is startled]
2546,7,9,Cartman,"Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. [begins to focus the shot. Butters and Token stand together]"
2547,7,9,Butters,Cheese!
2548,7,9,Cartman,"No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! [Butters and Cartman move apart. Token moves off to a boulder a little farther away, Butters moves a bit closer to the camera]"
2549,7,9,Butters,Cheese!
2550,7,9,Cartman,"No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!"
2551,7,9,Butters,Oh...
2552,7,9,Cartman,"Token, look away to the right. [Token looks off to the right] More. [Token turns his head to the right] More!"
2553,7,9,Token,[turns all his body to the right] Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
2554,7,9,Cartman,"So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! [starts the timer, then steps into the shot] Our first album cover."
2555,7,9,Cartman,"Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights."
2556,7,9,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused."
2557,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.
2558,7,9,Stan,"Boy, I'll say!"
2559,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees."
2560,7,9,Randy Marsh,Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
2561,7,9,FBI Agents and Detective,"Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! [leads the parents away]"
2562,7,9,Stan,"[walks off in the opposite direction] Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice."
2563,7,9,Kenny,(Yeah)
2564,7,9,Kyle,"No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!"
2565,7,9,Stan,Oh yeah.
2566,7,9,Kyle,"Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!"
2567,7,9,Kenny,(Yeah!)
2568,7,9,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week."
2569,7,9,Cartman,[walks up] Oh hey guys. How's it going?
2570,7,9,Kyle,"We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!"
2571,7,9,Cartman,"[brushes off Kyle's comment] I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, [brings out the CD] Faith + 1, is about to go platinum."
2572,7,9,Stan,It is?? [Kyle's jaw drops]
2573,7,9,Cartman,"That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya! [tugs at one of the lobes on Kyle's hat] Hahahaha ha ha!"
2574,7,9,Kyle,"You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!"
2575,7,9,Cartman,"It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album."
2576,7,9,Kyle,"You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!"
2577,7,9,Stan,"Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity."
2578,7,9,Cartman,"I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! [walks off]"
2579,7,9,Kyle,Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
2580,7,9,Stan,What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
2581,7,9,Kenny,(Yeah.)
2582,7,9,T Shirt Vendor,Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm!
2583,7,9,Bible Vendor,Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.
2584,7,9,Cartman,"Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually.."
2585,7,9,Elderly Woman,"Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics."
2586,7,9,Cartman,"[takes the woman's body and puts it in the treasurer's box] I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ."
2587,7,9,Butters,"Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. [Cartman flashes an angry look at Butters. The woman looks deceived, but she takes the album with her anyway]"
2588,7,9,Cartman,"Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off."
2589,7,9,Announcers and MC,"[the boys look up] All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest 2003! [the boys leave their booth and enter the stadium] are you ready for some live music? [the crown inside begins to move]"
2590,7,9,A Man,Yeah Jesus!
2591,7,9,Announcers and MC,Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity! [the lights come up on them]
2592,7,10,Father Maxi,"Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver. [the four boys are shown in their funeral best]"
2593,7,10,Eric Cartman,"[yawns] Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring."
2594,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[jabs Cartman and says in hushed tones] You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!"
2595,7,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly."
2596,7,10,Father Maxi,"It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple ""man walks into a bar"" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again. [screeching tires are heard]"
2597,7,10,Mr Garrison,[rushing into the crowd] Look out!! [everyone turns to see. An elderly driver approaches them]
2598,7,10,Elderly Driver,"[somewhat short, nearsighted] Huh? Was that a stop sign back there? [the banner recedes behind him. Everyone screams and the driver begins mowing people down. He crashes into a light standard at the other end of the market] Ooooh, I think I hit a pothole."
2599,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?"
2600,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue."
2601,7,10,Stan Marsh,But they kill people.
2602,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away."
2603,7,10,Marvin Marsh,[enters in his motorized wheelchair] I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! [stops at his place at table]
2604,7,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oooh, Hi Dad."
2605,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"[to Randy] I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!"
2606,7,10,Randy Marsh,Yes Dad.
2607,7,10,Marvin Marsh,And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
2608,7,10,Randy Marsh,Yes I know.
2609,7,10,Marvin Marsh,And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!
2610,7,10,Stan Marsh,"I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die."
2611,7,10,Elderly Man,"Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet!"
2612,7,10,Mona,"No, but it's the shortest. I save the most gas that way. [back at the pond the fisherman casts his line and looks back at the car]"
2613,7,10,Elderly Man,You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!
2614,7,10,Mona,"Less miles means less gas, you old fool. [back at the pond the fisherman catches something and is reeling it in, but looks at the car in doing so]"
2615,7,10,Elderly Man,There's Country Kitchen right there!
2616,7,10,Mona,Where?
2617,7,10,Elderly Man,"Right there! You're gonna miss it! [the woman steps hard on the brake and spins the car out of control. The fisherman is about to put his catch into his little boat. The car smashes through the guard rail over a bridge and lands directly on the fisherman, killing him.]"
2618,7,10,Mona,Is this the parking lot?
2619,7,10,Elderly Man,I think so.
2620,7,10,News Anchor,"Another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, who were trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in Deer Creek, where three construction workers and a bulldozer [shown] were run down by senior citizen Paul Thom [shown, irate], who was trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public outcry is forcing the DMV to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy, though no decision has yet to be made."
2621,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!"
2622,7,10,Seniors,[randomly] Yeah!
2623,7,10,Elderly Woman 1,[rises] I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
2624,7,10,Elderly Man 1,"[waving his cane] We need to let everyone know we're pissed off, and we're not gonna take it anymore!"
2625,7,10,Seniors,"[randomly] Yeah! Yeah! That's right, Pete!"
2626,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about? [everyone seems to have lost a clue] Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-"
2627,7,10,Elderly Woman 2,[rises] Oooo. Was it the kids skateboarding on the sidewalks? No? [sits down]
2628,7,10,Elderly Man 2,"[seated behind a walker] Oh, I remember! They're gonna take our licenses away!"
2629,7,10,Seniors,"[randomly, suddenly animated] Yeah! Yeah! That's right!"
2630,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!"
2631,7,10,Seniors,"[randomly] Me too! Yeah, that's right! And mine too!"
2632,7,10,Elderly Woman 1,I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
2633,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"So now, what are we gonna do about it?"
2634,7,10,Elderly Man 3,Do about what?
2635,7,10,Elderly Woman 3,They're gonna take our licenses away.
2636,7,10,Elderly Woman 1,They are?? They can't do that! [brief argument ensues]
2637,7,10,Marvin Marsh,That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!
2638,7,10,Elderly Man 3,"Great idea, Marvin!"
2639,7,10,Elderly Woman 4,"Wait, ah I think we're having that meeting right now."
2640,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"...Oh, right, this is the meeting."
2641,7,10,Elderly Man 4,Right. To get those damn kids to stop skateboarding on the sidewalks!
2642,7,10,Seniors,[randomly] Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's gotta stop them!
2643,7,10,Randy Marsh,"[steps into the kitchen] Sharon, have you seen Dad?"
2644,7,10,Sharon Marsh,"He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center."
2645,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Oh. [steps back out] Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out..."
2646,7,10,Sharon Marsh,Every senior in town will be driving home...
2647,7,10,Randy Marsh,[with rising alarm] At the same time. [closeup] Oh My God!
2648,7,10,Randy Marsh,Get inside! Get inside! [people begin taking heed] Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! [everyone moves off the streets in panic]
2649,7,10,Someone,Oh my Goddd!
2650,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"[amid the crowd] All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime."
2651,7,10,Elderly Woman 1,"So long, everybody."
2652,7,10,Elderly Man 5,"Goodbye, Missy. [other seniors say their goodbyes. They drive off slowly, some bumping into other cars on their way out]"
2653,7,10,Randy Marsh,Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving! [everyone runs off in a panic. Randy finds Gerald and grabs him] Gerald! Where are the boys?!
2654,7,10,Gerald Broflovski,We've gotta get out of here!
2655,7,10,Randy Marsh,"The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!"
2656,7,10,Gerald Broflovski,"They, they're... they're playing street hockey!"
2657,7,10,Randy Marsh,[closeup] Oh My God!! [lets Gerald go and runs off]
2658,7,10,Eric Cartman,"[providing his own play-by-play] With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again [the ball bounces off Cartman's girth], proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!"
2659,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
2660,7,10,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
2661,7,10,Randy Marsh,"[in the distance] GET OFF THE STREETS! [Cartman perks up a bit] GET OFF THE STREETS! [the other boys listen, then turn to face the source of the sound]"
2662,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look!"
2663,7,10,Randy Marsh,[running across empty fields] GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
2664,7,10,Stan Marsh,What is that?
2665,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
2666,7,10,Randy Marsh,[coming closer] GET OFF... GET OFF THE STREET!
2667,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, is that your dad?"
2668,7,10,Stan Marsh,I think so.
2669,7,10,Eric Cartman,Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
2670,7,10,Randy Marsh,-STREETS!! OFF-
2671,7,10,Stan Marsh,What is he saying?
2672,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,I can't understand him.
2673,7,10,Randy Marsh,GAAAAAH!!
2674,7,10,Eric Cartman,[slowly] Calm down! We cannot understand you!
2675,7,10,Kenny McCormick,"[Looks to his right] (Ohhhhh, look!) [a phalanx of slow-moving cars cruises down the street towards them] (You guys!)"
2676,7,10,Stan Marsh,Oh! [drops his hockey stick and holds his hands to his face]
2677,7,10,Eric Cartman,Old people!
2678,7,10,Randy Marsh,"[scoops them up and away] Come on! [the cars get closer, Randy and the boys head for a an abandoned lodge]"
2679,7,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, they're coming! [the other boys mutter other things]"
2680,7,10,Randy Marsh,Get over there! Stay low! [the boys go to the far wall and turn around]
2681,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,Why are they all out driving at the same time?
2682,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Shhhh! [lowers the blinds, closed them, and peeks out. Seeing nothing, he closes the blinds and sighs in relief] It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find- [a blue car crashes through the large picture window the blinds were covering and stops. Randy jumps in alarm] AWWWW!!"
2683,7,10,Elderly Driver,[a man] I don't remember there being a building here.
2684,7,10,Randy Marsh,"RUN! [they all gather at a corner, but another car crashes through the wall]"
2685,7,10,Elderly Passenger,"[a woman] I told you to turn left, Larry."
2686,7,10,Randy Marsh,Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! [he and the boys run up the stairs]
2687,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,Aah! There's another one!
2688,7,10,Randy and the Boys,AAAHH!!
2689,7,10,Elderly Driver,"[follows them up the stair in her car] Excuse me, is this Costello Avenue? [Randy and the boys reach the second floor]"
2690,7,10,Randy Marsh,"In here! [Randy opens a door and a bloody body drops down, dangling by its feet. They move on to the next room and close the door]"
2691,7,10,Eric Cartman,They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
2692,7,10,Randy Marsh,Quiet! Keep quiet! [a few seconds of silence pass]
2693,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I'm scared."
2694,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. [looks for a light switch to flip on]"
2695,7,10,Stan Marsh,I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
2696,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. [finds the switch and flips them on, revealing a car]"
2697,7,10,Elderly Driver,How the hell did we get up here?
2698,7,10,Randy and the Boys,AAAAAAAHH!! [quickly exit the room]
2699,7,10,Elderly Passenger,I told you this was the wrong way!
2700,7,10,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage."
2701,7,10,DMV Official,"[seated in the middle, takes a license from an elderly man] Alrighty. [cuts it in two and drops the halves into a box]  There we go. Next? [a fat elderly lady approaches, then the elderly man with the walker]"
2702,7,10,Elderly Man 2,It ain't right what you're doin'! I never had an accident in my life!
2703,7,10,Elderly Woman 6,That's right. You shouldn't punish all of us. [the senior with the walker leaves the table]
2704,7,10,DMV Official,"We're sorry, but this is the only way to be sure. Next please. [cuts up another license] There we go."
2705,7,10,Elderly Man 6,But how am I supposed to get to the grocery store? Or the pharmacy to buy medicine?
2706,7,10,DMV Official,"Well, maybe you should be in a nursing home. Hmmm?"
2707,7,10,Elderly Man 7,Some of us would rather die!
2708,7,10,DMV Official,"Well, we can certainly help you with that, too."
2709,7,10,Elderly Woman 7,We aren't second-class citizens!
2710,7,10,Elderly Man 8,"That's right! You can take our licenses, but you'll never take our pride!"
2711,7,10,An Elderly Man,Yeah...
2712,7,10,Eric Cartman,"Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?"
2713,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around."
2714,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving."
2715,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!"
2716,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[to the other boys] Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside."
2717,7,10,Eric Cartman,"My God, he's right. [the boys climb in, strap themselves in, and Cartman offers a quick prayer] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death. [Marvin starts up the car and groans a bit] Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys. [a few moments later] Except for you, Kyle."
2718,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Okay, all set? [he backs out of the a driveway, and an oncoming car honks at him. The driver screams something at him. Pretty soon, other cars and trucks are doing their best to avoid him. Cars begin crashing and flying through the air. The boys wince at every accident]"
2719,7,10,Kenny McCormick,(Oooooo my God!) [a police cruiser catches up to them]
2720,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa."
2721,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Eh? [signals to the officer] Go around. Go around, you moron!"
2722,7,10,Officer Barbrady,"Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!"
2723,7,10,Eric Cartman,I believe that's us... thank God. [Marvin pulls over to the side and stops. Barbrady stops as well and approaches the driver side.]
2724,7,10,Officer Barbrady,"Could I see your license, please?"
2725,7,10,Marvin Marsh,I ain't got one! You peckers took it!
2726,7,10,Officer Barbrady,"Well then, I have to take you to jail."
2727,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!"
2728,7,10,Marvin Marsh,Stupid son of a- God damnit!
2729,7,10,Officer Barbrady,"I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh."
2730,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!"
2731,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!"
2732,7,10,Randy Marsh,"You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!"
2733,7,10,Marvin Marsh,Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.
2734,7,10,Randy Marsh,"We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm? [wags his left index finger at Marvin] Who's the sorry-sorry?"
2735,7,10,Marvin Marsh,Kiss my sagging ass!
2736,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!"
2737,7,10,Marvin Marsh,Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!
2738,7,10,Stan Marsh,What's that?
2739,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right! [points to Randy] And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!"
2740,7,10,Mr Garrison,"And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a ""Mongol,"" not to be confused with a ""mongoloid"" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what [notices something outside and goes to the window, his voice fading off] the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid..."
2741,7,10,Mr Garrison,[What he sees is elderly paratroopers drifting down onto the school grounds. The kids' eyes follow him and then the kids gather at the window with him] That's odd. [the AARP has landed] Those ROTC guys are way off course. [the paratroopers open their cargo boxes and unload some firearms]
2742,7,10,Eric Cartman,More old people!
2743,7,10,Stan Marsh,The American Association of Retired Persons.
2744,7,10,Mr Garrison,"Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back."
2745,7,10,AARP leader,Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team to Point Delta!
2746,7,10,AARP member 1,[a heavyset woman] Bravo Team is go.
2747,7,10,AARP member 2,[a light-skinned black man] Move! Move! Move!
2748,7,10,AARP member 3,[a woman in purple dress] Let's go! Let's go! [Mr. Garrison comes out to meet them.]
2749,7,10,Mr Garrison,"Uh, can I help you folks find something? [the woman smacks him across the face with the butt of her semi-automatic.] Oowww! [goes down in pain on one knee. The seniors begin firing away, with rifles, semi-automatics, whatever. The kids look on and gasp]"
2750,7,10,Eric Cartman,Old people gone mad!
2751,7,10,AARP member,"[woman wearing a flower-design dress] Contact. [quickly aims her machine gun at Randy] Put your hands up, young man!"
2752,7,10,AARP leader,Marvin Marsh?
2753,7,10,Marvin Marsh,[turns around] Yes?
2754,7,10,AARP leader,"I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP. Hu-we've come to help the seniors in this town fight back."
2755,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill."
2756,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart",Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We just had to stop by Country Kitchen Buffet first.
2757,7,10,AARP leader,[a black man] It's the nursing home! Liberate our comrades!
2758,7,10,Male Nurse,"There now, Mr. Johnson. [wheels a senior across the room] We can go to the cafeteria and get you some creamed corn and toast. [the front doors swing open and the nurse stops in his tracks. The AARP members swarm in] Can I help you?"
2759,7,10,AARP leader,"Help this! [jams the butt of his gun into the nurse, and the nurse falls.] The revolution is on, brother! [hands Mr. Johnson a semi-automatic] We're taking control of the town!"
2760,7,10,Mr Johnson,"Well, alright, well it's about damn time! [addresses the nursing home residents] Hey everyone, we're taking the town. [other seniors look at him and express their approval]"
2761,7,10,AARP member,"[enters with the black leader] Seniors, we're taking the town over."
2762,7,10,AARP leader,The revolution is on! [walks away]
2763,7,10,Elderly Woman,The revolution?
2764,7,10,Elderly Man,"Oh, I'd better get my other sweater. [goes to change while the others leave the room]"
2765,7,10,A Nurse,"[distributing weapons] Mrs. Wyland, seniors are taking over the town. Would you like a gun?"
2766,7,10,Mrs Wyland,"Oh, I suppose so."
2767,7,10,Randy Marsh,What the hell is going on?!
2768,7,10,AARP member,Shut your piehole and get over there! [Randy joins Gerald and other adult hostages]
2769,7,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Randy, what is this?"
2770,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart",Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!
2771,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!"
2772,7,10,Randy Marsh,"Dad, what are you doing??"
2773,7,10,Marvin Marsh,The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!
2774,7,10,Elderly Woman,"[in dark-blue dress] Yeah, and we're gonna ask for more money in Medi-Care, too!"
2775,7,10,AARP leader,[black] That's right.
2776,7,10,Elderly Man,Yeah.
2777,7,10,Man in Vest,[handcuffed in front] Have you all got Alzheimer's? The-they're not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens.
2778,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart","[puts hand to ear] Heh?? [lowers his hand] We'll tell them if they don't give us our demands, we'll start killin' hostages!"
2779,7,10,Man in Vest,"Huh, right. They're gonna really believe that. [the elderly woman next to him simply lifts her gun and fires at the man point blank. The man falls down dead]"
2780,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?"
2781,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart","[puts hand to ear] Heh?? [lowers his hand] No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs!"
2782,7,10,Randy Marsh,"This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!"
2783,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!"
2784,7,10,Marvin Marsh,"All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station."
2785,7,10,AARP member,Reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in Conifer.
2786,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart","Good! Hell, us senior citizens could take over the entire country!"
2787,7,10,AARP lookout,[a black woman] We've got company! [the military arrives]
2788,7,10,Tank Driver,[over a PA system] Attention seniors: lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over!
2789,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart","Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business."
2790,7,10,Mrs Applegate,"[holding an RPG launcher] All right. [fires the rocket and falls back from the recoil. The rocket heads for a Jeep full of troops. The troops scramble off. The rocket strikes and demolishes the Jeep, killing one of the soldiers]"
2791,7,10,Tank Driver,What do you want?
2792,7,10,"The AARP, headed by Bill Stewart",[puts hand to ear] Heh??
2793,7,10,Marvin Marsh,We want our licenses back!
2794,7,10,Other Seniors,Yeah!
2795,7,10,Elderly Woman,That's right. And we want more money in Medi-Care!
2796,7,10,Other Seniors,Yeah!
2797,7,10,Elderly Man,And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk!
2798,7,10,Other Seniors,Yeah!
2799,7,10,Stan Marsh,Hey Dad.
2800,7,10,Randy Marsh,[runs to the fence] Stan! Boys! You're safe!
2801,7,10,Stan Marsh,"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?"
2802,7,10,Randy Marsh,"They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!"
2803,7,10,Kyle Broflovski,They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
2804,7,10,Randy Marsh,"[exasperated] Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!"
2805,7,10,Stan Marsh,"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?"
2806,7,10,Randy Marsh,"No, son. We... like to sleep in."
2807,7,10,An Elderly Woman,"Two hostages come front and center! [Randy looks back, alarmed]."
2808,7,10,Randy Marsh,"They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!! [the boys turn and leave] Boys, avenger me! AVENGE ME!!"
2809,7,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I wonder where Kyle is."
2810,7,11,Eric Cartman,Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
2811,7,11,Stan Marsh,Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
2812,7,11,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
2813,7,11,Eric Cartman,Who's joking? [a door opens and closes offscreen]
2814,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters excitedly, his arms up in the air] You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!"
2815,7,11,Eric Cartman,You have AIDS?
2816,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!"
2817,7,11,Eric Cartman,[stands up] Wow! Casa Bonita?!
2818,7,11,Kenny McCormick,[stands up] (Woo-hoo!)
2819,7,11,Stan Marsh,[stands up] What's Casa Bonita?
2820,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and [holds out his hand wide] all kinds of stuff!"
2821,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
2822,7,11,Eric Cartman,"This Saturday! Awesome! [begins to sing to ""La Cucaracha""] Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere. [begins to snap his fingers] Casa Bonita!"
2823,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Who said I'm inviting you? [this freezes Cartman for a few seconds]
2824,7,11,Eric Cartman,You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
2825,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
2826,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?"
2827,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one."
2828,7,11,Eric Cartman,Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
2829,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
2830,7,11,Eric Cartman,I have never been a dick to you.
2831,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,[rolls his eyes] Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
2832,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?"
2833,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinks back and counts the number of times Cartman has ripped on him for being a Jew][in the playground. Craig is there instead of Kenny] Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew![in the playground, by the school's back doors] You're a Jew![in Cartman's room. Cartman is wearing a crown] Shut your God-damned Jew mouth![at Kyle's house, on the front steps] Good job, Jew![singing the Dreidel song with Kyle's family and Stan] Jew...[leaving his seat in class] Shut up, Jew![at Cartman's house, with outfits] You're Jewish!![seated on a curb with the other boys] Dude, he's Jewish![staking out a house] Jew![on Nightline, seated next to Stan] Jew![in Cartman's dining room] Jew![at the side of a road, with Tweek and with their parents] Jew![next to stacks of lumber, as Kyle is about to whack him] Jew![at a barn, through a hole on the roof] Jew![Stan's room. Kyle reads a Bible] Jew?![At the Costa Rican rainforest, during practice] ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!"""
2834,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[Cartman thinks back as well] Okay, except maybe for that one time."
2835,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. [turns and walks away, but Cartman stays close]"
2836,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place [Kyle turns around] in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! [holds his hands together in a sign of pleading]"
2837,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[crosses his arms and avoids Cartman's eyes] Sorry, my mind's made up."
2838,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[turns irate and flips him off] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day! [shoves the middle finger close to Kyle's face] Kiss my balls, asshole!!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, closes, and opens again. Cartman returns and apologizes] Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it."
2839,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,[clearly annoyed now] I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
2840,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[turns irate and flips him off again] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, then closes]"
2841,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys! [waves them on. Next scene is him getting a large platter of food] Oh, awesome!! [next scene is him waving his friends to a cave] Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave! [next scene is him by a waterfall] Wow, cliff divers! [a cliff diver takes a dive from the top of the waterfall. Next scene is Cartman on his third dish] More sopapillas, please! [next scene has him dancing in front of a low stage, on which a mariachi quartet plays its songs. An image of Kyle floats through his dream]"
2842,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go."
2843,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[with more foods on his plates, the dream dissolves. He's pulled up and away] No! Noooo! [he's pulled out of Casa Bonita and floats away] Casa Bonita! Noooo! [startled out of his dream] AAAAH!! [catches his breath] Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!"
2844,7,11,Eric Cartman,[looking quite presentable] Hi Kyle. [smiles]
2845,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[studies Cartman a bit, but isn't impressed] That isn't it, Cartman."
2846,7,11,Eric Cartman,What isn't it?
2847,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
2848,7,11,Eric Cartman,...I don't understand the difference.
2849,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,I know you don't. [steps back and slams the door on Cartman's face]
2850,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up! [Annie and Red walk by at the far end of the hall. Jimmy stops] Dude, uh I need your help on something."
2851,7,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-problem?"
2852,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?"
2853,7,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice."
2854,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?"
2855,7,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote."
2856,7,11,Eric Cartman,Like what?
2857,7,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock."
2858,7,11,Eric Cartman,Who's there?
2859,7,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Ing-mar ...Bergman. [Cartman jumps, but not because of the joke. Kyle approaches them from the other end of the hall.] Now you say, ""Ingmar Bergman who?"" [Cartman quickly punches Jimmy in the face]"
2860,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Take that, Jimmy! [strikes him again, and Jimmy falls away] And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! [Kyle stops by and looks. Cartman glances at him] Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?! [looks at Kyle] Oh, Kyle. Hey."
2861,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? [turns and walks on his way]
2862,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Uh... [turns and runs towards Kyle] He-hey Kyle! Knock knock. [follows him around the corner] Knock knock, Kyle!"
2863,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! [approaches a table with Kenny, Stan, and Butters]"
2864,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Wow, that's gonna be so fun!"
2865,7,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us."
2866,7,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah!) [Cartman sits at his own table, alone.]"
2867,7,11,Eric Cartman,Hey Kyle.
2868,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Well?
2869,7,11,Eric Cartman,Well what?
2870,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
2871,7,11,Eric Cartman,"I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go."
2872,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did."
2873,7,11,Eric Cartman,"So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool."
2874,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
2875,7,11,Eric Cartman,"I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. [turns and walks away]"
2876,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Eh... hey, Cartman? [Cartman turns around] You really don't care that you can't go?"
2877,7,11,Eric Cartman,"I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore."
2878,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too."
2879,7,11,Eric Cartman,Good.
2880,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place."
2881,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Sweet, whatever. [walks on, then mouths to himself] Bingo!"
2882,7,11,Butters Stotch,"What's this all about, Eric?"
2883,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[leads him to a telescope, then turns] Butters, can you keep a secret?"
2884,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Well, sure I can!"
2885,7,11,Eric Cartman,"For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible."
2886,7,11,Butters Stotch,Nnn-how terrible?
2887,7,11,Eric Cartman,"A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth."
2888,7,11,Butters Stotch,What?? [begins rubbing his hands together nervously]
2889,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. [backs up and looks through the eyepiece] Do you see anything?"
2890,7,11,Butters Stotch,I just see stars. [Cartman hops onto a chair and fishes in his left jacket pocket. He pulls out a wad of junk hanging from a string]
2891,7,11,Eric Cartman,Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
2892,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Nope, uh I don't see any... [Cartman holds up the wad against the objective lens] Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!"
2893,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? [Butters looks through again and Cartman holds up the wad, moving it closer to the objective lens.]"
2894,7,11,Butters Stotch,It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
2895,7,11,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
2896,7,11,Butters Stotch,When do you think uh it'll get here?
2897,7,11,Eric Cartman,"I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations. [heads for his desk and pulls out a calculator] 10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus."
2898,7,11,Butters Stotch,What??
2899,7,11,Eric Cartman,"According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours."
2900,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!"
2901,7,11,Eric Cartman,"No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!"
2902,7,11,Butters Stotch,Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
2903,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! [heads out the door]"
2904,7,11,Butters Stotch,AAAAHH! [follows him out]
2905,7,11,Butters Stotch,Oh Jeez!
2906,7,11,Eric Cartman,Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! [opens the shelter's lid]
2907,7,11,Butters Stotch,"[enters and climbs down the ladder within] Oh God! Oh Jesus! [Cartman watches him, then follows him down the ladder]"
2908,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[reaches the shelter floor] All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks."
2909,7,11,Butters Stotch,"But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too."
2910,7,11,Eric Cartman,No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
2911,7,11,Butters Stotch,Are you sure?
2912,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[looks away] I'm not sure of anything anymore. [turns and climbs up the ladder. He makes it out and looks down] Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth."
2913,7,11,Butters Stotch,But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
2914,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Well, you know, with your wiener. [Butters just stares back] Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. [leaves and closes the lid, then locks it]"
2915,7,11,Butters Stotch,"[in darkness] Oh God, oh God!"
2916,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
2917,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late."
2918,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, screw him. Let's go. [the door bell rings and Kyle looks at the door] Oh, finally! [walks to get the door, but sees Cartman instead]"
2919,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[bearing a gift] Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present."
2920,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Thanks, dude."
2921,7,11,Eric Cartman,Hope you have a good one. See you later. [turns around and walks toward the street]
2922,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Oh wait. Cartman.
2923,7,11,Eric Cartman,Yes?
2924,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
2925,7,11,Eric Cartman,[enters the house] Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
2926,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
2927,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure."
2928,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, let's go."
2929,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"[heads for the front door] Okay, boys. Get in the car."
2930,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[gets excited] Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!"
2931,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"[finds Butters' parents approaching] Oh, hello Chris, Linda."
2932,7,11,Chris,[misty-eyed. Linda sobs silently] Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
2933,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
2934,7,11,Chris,"We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but... [Linda cries audibly] Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. [they leave. Linda is sobbing hard]"
2935,7,11,Linda Stotch,Oh Butters!
2936,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw dude, weak."
2937,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[lowers his head and walks towards the front door] Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. [brightens up] Well, let's get going, shall we?"
2938,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing."
2939,7,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's kinda weird."
2940,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[a little stunned] Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters..."
2941,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Nah, I can't. We should help look for him."
2942,7,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2943,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday."
2944,7,11,Eric Cartman,Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the... [catches himself and waits for a reaction. None comes] In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
2945,7,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. [exits]"
2946,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. And then we can try the football field. [exits]
2947,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,I'll drive you boys. [exits]
2948,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[left alone] Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!"
2949,7,11,Police Captain,"All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for: [holds up a picture of Butters] Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him."
2950,7,11,Butters Stotch,"[reading some directions] ""Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..."" [the lid opens up above him] Hello? [rises and looks up] Hello??"
2951,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[suddenly looks in, looking terribly roughed up] Butters!"
2952,7,11,Butters Stotch,"[jumps back, startled] Hwaaaah!!"
2953,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!"
2954,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Wuh, wait, well, what happened??"
2955,7,11,Eric Cartman,[faking fatigue] The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
2956,7,11,Butters Stotch,What about my parents. Did you see them?
2957,7,11,Eric Cartman,"There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. [coughs]"
2958,7,11,Butters Stotch,"[heads for the ladder and begins to climb] Oh my God, let me see!"
2959,7,11,Eric Cartman,"No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh..."
2960,7,11,Butters Stotch,[off the ladder] How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
2961,7,11,Eric Cartman,"We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. [strains a bit, like he's gonna cough]"
2962,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me."
2963,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild. [coughs] I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday. [moves off] G-goodbye! [locks the lid down once again] All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight."
2964,7,11,Field Reporter,"Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling."
2965,7,11,Police Captain,"All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him."
2966,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[not spoken, he's thinking this while the captain speaks.] Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. [closes his eyes and begins anticipating. Three images come up. The first is of his waitress bringing him food, the second is of him dancing before a mariachi band, the third is of the cliff divers. He begins to dance while he daydream]"
2967,7,11,Police Captain,"Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. [Cartman's dance is rudely interrupted by this]"
2968,7,11,Eric Cartman,What what what?
2969,7,11,Police Captain,"I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts! [the crowd breaks up and begins the search]"
2970,7,11,Eric Cartman,UUuuugh!! [runs off]
2971,7,11,Butters Stotch,"But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl. [the shelter lid opens again] Eric? [rises and looks up the shaft] Eric, is that you?"
2972,7,11,Eric Cartman,[scrambling down the ladder] Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
2973,7,11,Butters Stotch,Who's coming this way?
2974,7,11,Eric Cartman,"The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!"
2975,7,11,Butters Stotch,Oh God! I hate cannibals!
2976,7,11,Eric Cartman,"They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive."
2977,7,11,Butters Stotch,Noooo!
2978,7,11,Eric Cartman,"We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box! [picks it up and promptly drops it over Butters so Butters can't see a thing.] There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins."
2979,7,11,Butters Stotch,But I can't see nothin'.
2980,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. [guides him to the ladder and nudges him up] There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top. [Butters climbs out] Good."
2981,7,11,Butters Stotch,Are we out in the destruction?
2982,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town."
2983,7,11,Butters Stotch,Aw man.
2984,7,11,Eric Cartman,"All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. [walks off. Butters follows]"
2985,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble."
2986,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Huh... Oh, it's terrible."
2987,7,11,Eric Cartman,We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
2988,7,11,Butters Stotch,Whoa!
2989,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here. [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back] Oh my God!"
2990,7,11,Butters Stotch,Whaaat??
2991,7,11,Eric Cartman,"It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back]"
2992,7,11,Butters Stotch,AAAAHH!
2993,7,11,Eric Cartman,"We've got to fight them off! [jabs at the air a few times] Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope! [makes ""cannibal"" noises] Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!"
2994,7,11,Butters Stotch,Waaaaaah!
2995,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[picks up a twig] Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? [goes to Butters' other side and begins breaking off pieces of the twig as he makes more ""cannibal"" noises.]"
2996,7,11,Butters Stotch,Ooohhhh!
2997,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh! [swings it and kills the ""cannibal""] Die! [one last jab, the ""cannibal"" ""croaks"" and it's over]"
2998,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!"
2999,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[feigns exhaustion] The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me, [checks out his hand] which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well."
3000,7,11,Butters Stotch,Oh no!
3001,7,11,Eric Cartman,"We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!"
3002,7,11,Butters Stotch,Uh w-where??
3003,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Look! There's an old refrigerator! [reaches it and opens it] Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!"
3004,7,11,Butters Stotch,Aren't you coming?
3005,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change. [begins to ""change""] No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter."
3006,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you."
3007,7,11,Eric Cartman,"I love you too, man. I just [goes into spasms] You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! [lunges at Butters, who quickly closes the refrigerator door. Cartman walks up and rips off the door handle, then walks away chuckling to himself. A few seconds later a garbage truck backs up and removes the refrigerator from the gas station]"
3008,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Hah! [turns off his bear alarm clock, hops out of bed cheerfully and skips to his wall calendar he made just for the occasion.] It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday! [crosses off Tuesday on his calendar] Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool! [walks off to get dressed] Oh, that would be so bad-ass!"
3009,7,11,Butters Stotch,"[rises, catches his breath, and dusts himself off] Finally I can breathe a- [looks at the apparent devastation around him] Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left. [walks forth] Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello? [rustling sounds are heard and he tenses up in fear, then softly] Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals. [more loudly] Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am? [he watches, and a dog emerges from the rubble] Oh. Aww, it's a little dog. [approaches the mutt] Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. [walks into the rubble and begins his work]"
3010,7,11,Eric Cartman,"We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail."
3011,7,11,Stan Marsh,Really?
3012,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's pretty cool."
3013,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[sniffs] ""Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show."
3014,7,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do."
3015,7,11,Eric Cartman,"What? Fuck Kyle. [the others look at him in astonishment] Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle."
3016,7,11,Eric Cartman,Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]
3017,7,11,Stan Marsh,Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. [they pass a missing person's billboard with Butters on it and South Park PD's phone number].
3018,7,11,Eric Cartman,Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. [they pass a missing person's billboard with Butters on it and South Park PD's phone number].
3019,7,11,Kenny McCormick,Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. [they pass a missing person's billboard with Butters on it and South Park PD's phone number].
3020,7,11,Butters Stotch,"[off-screen] You take away the biggest part of me. [the worker listens, then goes to the source of the sound] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go. [hums a bit; the worker arrives to see him sweeping] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan..."
3021,7,11,"Irene, Trash Dump Worker","Hello? [her name tag reads ""Irene.""]"
3022,7,11,Butters Stotch,[quickly arms himself with the broom] HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?
3023,7,11,"Irene, Trash Dump Worker",With what?
3024,7,11,Butters Stotch,"You're not a cannibal, are you?"
3025,7,11,"Irene, Trash Dump Worker",No
3026,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Oh. [drops the broom and smiles] Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!"
3027,7,11,"Irene, Trash Dump Worker","Kid, what are you doin' here?"
3028,7,11,Butters Stotch,"I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look. [moves off to his left, she follows. They pass a row of makeshift buildings that he built overnight] This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this [a statue that reads Cartman under it] is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh? [promptly unzips and drops his pants, then steps forward.] I'm ready whenever you are."
3029,7,11,"Irene, Trash Dump Worker","Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump."
3030,7,11,Butters Stotch,"Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!"
3031,7,11,"Irene, Trash Dump Worker","No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week."
3032,7,11,Butters Stotch,"[looks at her for a long time, then looks towards the town] Oh... [realizes he's been tricked, he looks down and pulls up his pants.] Ma'am, can I use your phone?"
3033,7,11,Eric Cartman,"We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita! [the boys climb out of the car] Aw man, this is gonna be so great!"
3034,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together. [Cartman stops and dances in place. A phone rings] Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone. [fishes it out of her purse and answers it] Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great! [to her charges] Boys, they found Butters. [Cartman stops dancing and his grin turns into panic] He's okay."
3035,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, awesome."
3036,7,11,Stan Marsh,I knew he'd turn up.
3037,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why? [her face turns stern] Oh really? [Cartman looks around for a way to escape]"
3038,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?
3039,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you. [hangs up and puts the phone away] Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. [the anger now registers on the other boys' faces]"
3040,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?
3041,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!"
3042,7,11,Eric Cartman,But... Casa Bonita.
3043,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Cartman, who turns around] I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!"
3044,7,11,Eric Cartman,[turns to face Casa Bonita] But I... [turns back] but... [suddenly takes Kyle hostage] Stand back!
3045,7,11,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, stop it!"
3046,7,11,Eric Cartman,[backs up towards the restaurant with Kyle still hostage] I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! [sirens are heard]
3047,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"It's too late, fatass. [Cartman stops] They'll be here in less than a minute."
3048,7,11,Eric Cartman,[hauls Kyle away a bit longer] Ah! Eh. Nuh! [throws him away and dashes for the entrance] Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
3049,7,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!"
3050,7,11,Eric Cartman,But... Casa Bonita.
3051,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,[rises and turns around] Cartman!
3052,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, awesome!! [approaches a table which has a family enjoying its dinner] Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your- [grabs some food from both the mother's plate and the father's plate] Thank you. Thank you. [climbs over the table] Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave! [hops off and runs for the cave, barging his way past two other kids] Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave! [runs in] Oh! [stops at a treasure chest with a pirate skeleton beside it] Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton! [moves on] Oh man, I'm so scared! [exits]"
3053,7,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers! [rushes to them, stopping long enough to dance before the mariachi band] Come on! Come on, dive! [atop the waterfall, a cliff diver stands ready] Dive, asshole! [the diver dives into the pool below] Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh? [looks towards the entrance and sees the rest of his party and the police enter the restaurant] Whoa. [dashes for the jail set at the Photo Flash Back. He puts on the suit waiting for the next customer and looks out from behind bars. His picture is taken and he quickly jumps down from the cell. He moves on to the table he dreamt about two weeks ago] Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?! [a waitress arrives with a plate of sopapillas] Sweeet! [runs off with it and heads for a new attraction] Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! [an officer steps in and blocks his way, he tosses his dessert away and turns back]"
3054,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman! [the boys and Sheila trace his path and close in on Cartman. Cartman runs up along the side of the ""cliff"" until he gets to the top, where two other officers meet him]"
3055,7,11,Police Captain,"All right, kid! End of the line!"
3056,7,11,Eric Cartman,"[steps left] Ah. [steps right] Uh. [moves around a bit more, then jumps off the cliff] Yeeeesss!"
3057,7,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus Christ! [Cartman ends up face down in the water, which isn't deep enough to drown him. He flips over and coughs."
3058,7,11,Police Captain,"Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?"
3059,7,11,Eric Cartman,Totally. [smiles]
3060,7,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. [a blond boy stands to his left] We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. [Gary looks around. The kids don't say a word]"
3061,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",Hello everybody. It's really great to meet you all.
3062,7,12,Mr Garrison,"Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at each other] He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste."
3063,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!"
3064,7,12,Kyle,"[quietly, to Stan] Oh, dude, what a little asshole!"
3065,7,12,Stan,"Yeah, screw that kid!"
3066,7,12,Mr Garrison,"All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? [Gary goes to the seat to Cartman's right as Cartman looks on with some trepidation. Once Gary is seated, Cartman lurches away from him about six inches]"
3067,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",[offering a handshake] Hey. My name's Gary.
3068,7,12,Cartman,[falsetto] Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
3069,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","[laughs] That's funny. You're cool, man."
3070,7,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon? [writes ""Moon Landing"" on the board]"
3071,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",[without hesitation] Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!
3072,7,12,Mr Garrison,"Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? [writes ""1969"" on the board]"
3073,7,12,Kyle,"Dude, that new kid is such a douche!"
3074,7,12,Cartman,Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place!
3075,7,12,Butters,"He's a peckerface, that's what he is!"
3076,7,12,Cartman,"Go kick his ass, Stan."
3077,7,12,Clyde,"Yeah, go kick his ass."
3078,7,12,Stan,"Well, maybe he won't fight."
3079,7,12,Cartman,Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
3080,7,12,Kyle,"Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!"
3081,7,12,Craig,"Yeah, little bitch!"
3082,7,12,Stan,"All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. [leaves]"
3083,7,12,Cartman,"Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan! [then, when Stan is gone, softly] All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?"
3084,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",[looks up as Stan approaches] Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?
3085,7,12,Stan,No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.
3086,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",Excuse me?
3087,7,12,Stan,I'm gonna kick your ass... [glances back] bitch.
3088,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid. [sigh] Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it."
3089,7,12,Stan,[off guard] Huh?
3090,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites."
3091,7,12,Stan,"Dude, stop it."
3092,7,12,Butters,"[back in the crowd] Let him have it, Stan!"
3093,7,12,Stan,"Shut up, Butters!"
3094,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday."
3095,7,12,Kyle,[back in the crowd] What are they doing?
3096,7,12,Cartman,"They're just standing there, talking. [A few moments later, Stan returns defeated. He glances back at Gary, then approaches the other boys]"
3097,7,12,Kyle,"What happened? [Stan glances back, then looks at Kyle]"
3098,7,12,Stan,I'm... [stares back at Gary] going over to his house for dinner tonight.
3099,7,12,Token,What?! How did that happen?
3100,7,12,Stan,[stammering] He's a really nice kid.
3101,7,12,Cartman,"You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!"
3102,7,12,Kyle,You're having dinner with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
3103,7,12,Dad,"Okay, my turn. [turns a little wheel] Ooo, five! [moves his piece] One two three four five. Uh, awww, lost your mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no! [they all laugh. Gary and Stan enter]"
3104,7,12,Mom,"Hey, it's Gary!"
3105,7,12,Older sister,Gary!
3106,7,12,Older brother,Great to see you!
3107,7,12,Mom,How are you?
3108,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad."
3109,7,12,Dad,Hi Stan!
3110,7,12,Mom,It's so nice to meet you.
3111,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",[the camera pans to the older brother] And this is my brother Mark.
3112,7,12,Mark,Hi!
3113,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",[then to the older sister] My sister Jenny.
3114,7,12,Jenny,Hey!
3115,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",My little brother Dave.
3116,7,12,Dave,Hi!
3117,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",And my baby sister Amanda.
3118,7,12,Amanda,[removes her pacifier] Hello Stan!
3119,7,12,Dad,"Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!"
3120,7,12,Stan,What's that?
3121,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?
3122,7,12,Stan,No.
3123,7,12,Dad,Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!
3124,7,12,Jenny,Oh yeah!
3125,7,12,Mark,"All right! Let's play! [the kids grab their instruments. Jenny and Gary take guitars, Mark takes a trumpet, Dave takes the drums, and Amanda takes the little piano. The kids launch into song]"
3126,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!
My family is the best!
If we ever have to face a challenge."
3127,7,12,The kids,My family!
3128,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","Can pass the test. [the parents bounce softly to the beat. Next scene, the family is back at table for dinner. Mom comes in with a big turkey platter]"
3129,7,12,Dad,Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? [the rest of the family chatters. Next scene shows Dave juggling three balls]
3130,7,12,Mark,All right! Go Dave!
3131,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",Yeah!
3132,7,12,Jenny,"Woohoo! [next scene is Mark doing Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"", with skull]"
3133,7,12,Mark,"Woohoo! [next scene is Mark doing Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"", with skull]"
3134,7,12,Mark,"Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? [next scene is Amando in Russian dress, dancing]"
3135,7,12,The Family,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! [next scene, they're all laughing at something]"
3136,7,12,Mark,"That's a great story, Sarah."
3137,7,12,Dad,"All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!"
3138,7,12,Mark,All right!
3139,7,12,Kids,Yeah!
3140,7,12,Mark,Woohoo! OOWW!
3141,7,12,Stan,The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
3142,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)",You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.
3143,7,12,Stan,Who's Joseph Smith? [they laugh at his ignorance]
3144,7,12,Mark,Only the most important person in the world.
3145,7,12,Jenny,You've never heard of him?
3146,7,12,Stan,No!
3147,7,12,"The Harrisons (Gary Sr, Karen, Mark, Jenny, Gary Jr., Dave, and Amanda)","Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad."
3148,7,12,The other kids,"Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right."
3149,7,12,Dad,"All right, you rascals. Gather round. [the kids draw closer to their dad] Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s."
3150,7,12,Singers,"Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
He started the Mormon religion
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb"
3151,7,12,Blacksmith,There goes that kooky Joseph Smith.
3152,7,12,Customer,"You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus."
3153,7,12,"Blacksmith, Customer, and Woman","Well, how do you know he didn't?"
3154,7,13,Mr Mackey,"[off-screen] M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-mk-m'kay? [Mr. Garrison approaches him, takes the microphone and puts it against one of the massive speakers, creating a loud feedback loop. The kids scream in pain as Mr. Garrison returns the mic to Mr. Mackey.] M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, m'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, ""Butt Out!"" [music starts up and a very enthusiastic troupe dashes out from behind the speakers and multi-screen monitor. After some chatter they begin to sing]"
3155,7,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen."
3156,7,14,Eric Cartman,Right. What are we playing again?
3157,7,14,Stan Marsh,Football.
3158,7,14,Eric Cartman,Got it. [the teams get into position]
3159,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay. 23! [Bebe appears behind him and taps him on the shoulder] Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! [Bebe taps him on the shoulder again. Stan turns and looks at her]"
3160,7,14,Bebe Stevens,Wendy breaks up.
3161,7,14,Stan Marsh,What? [looks let down]
3162,7,14,Bebe Stevens,Wendy breaks up with you. [turns to walk away. Stan looks on for a few seconds]
3163,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[moves forth to hold her up] Oh whoa, wait a minute. [Bebe turns around] What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  [This gets the other boys' attention]"
3164,7,14,Bebe Stevens,She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. [the other boys turn to see what's going on]
3165,7,14,Eric Cartman,"What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!"
3166,7,14,Bebe Stevens,"Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!"
3167,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!"
3168,7,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeh-heah, right!"
3169,7,14,Bebe Stevens,"God, you're so stupid! [turns around and walks away]"
3170,7,14,Eric Cartman,What a whore! [turns around and goes back to the game. The other boys do the same. Stan is too stunned to move]
3171,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up! [The boys get back into their playing positions. A few moments Kyle looks back] Stan? [Clyde looks back, then Cartman]"
3172,7,14,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Come on, Stan, it's first down still. [Butters looks back, then Kenny. Stan loses heart and walks off slowly, his head hanging low. The other boys look at each other, unsure what to make of that. A montage begins.]"
3173,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?"
3174,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,[not looking up] Why?
3175,7,14,Stan Marsh,'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
3176,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework."
3177,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[pleading] Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?"
3178,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[puts his book down and sighs] God damn it! [walks over to Wendy, but avoids eye contact] Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. [Wendy turns around]"
3179,7,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him."
3180,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"'Kay. [walks back to Stan, but avoids looking at him, as well] She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you."
3181,7,14,Stan Marsh,What? That's no answer! [nudges him a bit] Go tell her to be more direct with me.
3182,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[goes for his books and picks them up] No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. [walks off. Jimmy appears]"
3183,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, this is my life. [points at Jimmy] Jimmy!"
3184,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,Hey Stan.
3185,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?"
3186,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
3187,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her, [thinks] tell her... [gestures] she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me."
3188,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,She's what?
3189,7,14,Stan Marsh,She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
3190,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"...Okay. [walks over to Wendy] Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wendy. [she turns around with her books]"
3191,7,14,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah?
3192,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Stan says you're a cont...[pronouncing as ""cunt""]  you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-"
3193,7,14,Wendy Testaburger,Well tell Stan to fuck off!! [closes her locker and runs away]
3194,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"-cont- You're a cont-tinuing source of inspiration to him. [his mission done, he returns to Stan]"
3195,7,14,Stan Marsh,Well?
3196,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. [hangs his head for emphasis, then walks off]"
3197,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Over? [walks away dejected. He's next seen in bed, a blanket hung across his window blocking out the outside light. He has his sheets drawn up tight against his chin. A few moments later, Kyle enters with Butters, Cartman, Jimmy and Kenny. Kyle studies his friend.] Jesus..."
3198,7,14,Butters Stotch,"We came over to cheer you up, Stan!"
3199,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[softly, creaking] ...Go away."
3200,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live."
3201,7,14,Stan Marsh,Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
3202,7,14,Eric Cartman,"God, what a fag!"
3203,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, not now! [Cartman looks down, embarrassed]"
3204,7,14,Stan Marsh,"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken..."
3205,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Jeez, he's worse than I thought."
3206,7,14,Butters Stotch,Well what do we do now?
3207,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
3208,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
3209,7,14,Butters Stotch,What's Raisins?
3210,7,14,Blonde,"Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of you? [smiles and grabs some menus from the counter] Right over here. [leads the boys to their table]"
3211,7,14,Redhead,[waits at a table] So you guys having a good time today?
3212,7,14,Diners,"[Table 1, say, enthralled] Uh huh..."
3213,7,14,Blonde 2,"[waits at the next table] How about some more fun fries, guys?"
3214,7,14,Diners,"[Table 2, enthralled] Okay... [the waitress at the other end of the table smiles]"
3215,7,14,Brunette,"[at the same table] Boy, am I glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool."
3216,7,14,Blonde,"[leaving them at their table] Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you."
3217,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?"
3218,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven."
3219,7,14,Butters Stotch,This place is awesome!
3220,7,14,Eric Cartman,How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
3221,7,14,Lexus,[with flyaway light brown hair] Hey guys.
3222,7,14,Butters Stotch,Whoa!
3223,7,14,Lexus,How are we doing this afternoon?
3224,7,14,The Boys,Good.
3225,7,14,Lexus,"I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool."
3226,7,14,Butters Stotch,[amazed] W-we are.
3227,7,14,Lexus,So what can I get you?
3228,7,14,Eric Cartman,"Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts [Lexus winks at Butters] and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade."
3229,7,14,Lexus,"Great. I'll put your order in right now. [strokes Butters' shoulders, which sends shivers of excitement through his body]"
3230,7,14,Butters Stotch,"You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?"
3231,7,14,Lexus,"[near the kitchen] Raisins, girls! [sends an order along a conveyor to the kitchen staff]"
3232,7,14,Blonde 3,Woohoo!
3233,7,14,Redhead,Oh Yeah!
3234,7,14,Brunette 2,[farther away] Do it!
3235,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh? [a Raisins girl walks by with long black hair] Why don't you say hi to her? [calls out] Excuse me? [motions for her to come over]"
3236,7,14,Brunette 3,[walks back and to the table] Hi guys. My name's Porsche.
3237,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. Uh, this is Stan."
3238,7,14,Porsche,"Oh hey cutie. How are you? I love your hat. I used to have a hat juuust like that, except, it was black and it didn't have a puffball on it. Oh my God, my hands are sooo cold. How come people have hands, anyway? Did you ever wonder that? [Stan looks more and more miserable with every word coming out of her mouth.]"
3239,7,14,Raisins Girls,YMCA... [they make the hand signs for the letters. The rest of the diners look over at them and cheer them on] YMCA-A.
3240,7,14,Eric Cartman,"[really stuffed, with a soiled face] Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... [their meals have been served]"
3241,7,14,Porsche,"[still regaling Stan, who hasn't touched his food] Have you ever noticed how much sand there is at the beach? I mean, haven't you ever wondered where all this sand came from? Omigod, this one time, I saw a beetle that was thiiis big. Eeewww!"
3242,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Can we go, please?"
3243,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. Okay, come on you guys. [they all hop off their seats and walk off]"
3244,7,14,Porsche,"Oooh my God, thank you guys sooo much for coming to Raisins! [Butters is last to leave]"
3245,7,14,Lexus,"[sees him and stalls him] Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?"
3246,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go."
3247,7,14,Lexus,"Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??"
3248,7,14,Butters Stotch,When do you wanna see me?
3249,7,14,Lexus,[holds on to him] As soon as possible!
3250,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. [hands her the bill]"
3251,7,14,Lexus,"Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu! [comes around and gives him a full embrace]"
3252,7,14,Butters Stotch,[hugs her back] Waa... ahaaah... [the other boys arrive at the entrance]
3253,7,14,Raisins Girl,"Bye, guys! Thanks for coming to Raisins!"
3254,7,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?"
3255,7,14,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, I feel worse!"
3256,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there."
3257,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!"
3258,7,14,Butters Stotch,[catches up to the other boys] She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
3259,7,14,Stan Marsh,I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! [turns and opens one of the doors]
3260,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing?
3261,7,14,Stan Marsh,Something I should have done a long time ago. [walks out the door and into the night]
3262,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now! [Bebe rolls her eyes and sighs] All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!"
3263,7,14,Bebe Stevens,"Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of."
3264,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[thinks] Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?"
3265,7,14,Bebe Stevens,"If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play [closes her eyes] Peter Gabriel."
3266,7,14,Lexus,"Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes."
3267,7,14,Butters Stotch,[approaches] Lexus! [she takes a few steps back]
3268,7,14,Lexus,"Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie."
3269,7,14,Butters Stotch,I waited all night for you to get off work.
3270,7,14,Lexus,"Oh, really? [takes a few more steps back] Huhunh, that's great. Uhm, Maury..."
3271,7,14,Butters Stotch,I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
3272,7,14,Raisins Bouncer Maury,[a huge bouncer] There a problem?
3273,7,14,Lexus,Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
3274,7,14,Raisins Bouncer Maury,Right. [steps up behind her and shoves Butters aside. He keeps his arm in place so Butters doesn't get any closer to Lexus]
3275,7,14,Lexus,"[to Butters] Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? [moves forward, with Maury close behind]"
3276,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present."
3277,7,14,Lexus,"[stops and grabs it] Oh wow. Thanks, cutie."
3278,7,14,Butters Stotch,"It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. [tries to get closer, but Maury holds him back]"
3279,7,14,Lexus,"Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you. [reaches her bike] Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? [unlocks her bike from its post]"
3280,7,14,Butters Stotch,"[tries to get closer, but Maury him back] Well yeah, but, but, hey, [tries to get closer, but Maury him back] hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime."
3281,7,14,Lexus,"Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? [Maury helps her on to her bike]"
3282,7,14,Butters Stotch,O-kay!
3283,7,14,Lexus,"Bye, cutie!"
3284,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Bye, bye darling! [Maury turns and goes back to the restaurant. Butters holds his hands over his heart] Wow... a real-life relationship."
3285,7,14,Mr Garrison,"[sternly] All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. [the boys break up and head to their lockers. Stan remains on a bench on his back, alone, with just a towel and his hat on]"
3286,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[returns] Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball."
3287,7,14,Stan Marsh,[with emotion in his voice] I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
3288,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?"
3289,7,14,Stan Marsh,There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
3290,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!"
3291,7,14,Stan Marsh,Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
3292,7,14,Pete,"[with black puffy, feathery hair, streaked in red] Life is pain. Life is only pain. [his hair falls over his right eye, he jerks his head back to put it back in place] We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back] But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back] eats at your soul."
3293,7,14,Michael,"[dressed in something like a tuxedo, sporting a curly pompadour] Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad.

3297,7,14,Pete,"Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back]"
3298,7,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, so how do I join you?"
3299,7,14,Michael,"If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do."
3300,7,14,Stan Marsh,...'K.
3301,7,14,Mercedes,"Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you."
3302,7,14,Ferrari,Okay.
3303,7,14,Mercedes,"First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. ""Hey,  cutie."" [waves and winks] When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun. [they stop by a wooden bucket] We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins. [they leave the bucket] Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. ""Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in."" If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. ""I'll be right back with your order, guys."" [holds Ferrari's shoulder]"
3304,7,14,Ferrari,"Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes."
3305,7,14,Mercedes,"Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck. [Ferrari walks off] Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!"
3306,7,14,Porsche,"Okay! [opens the doors and Butters bolts in, quite excitedly]"

3333,7,14,Lexus,Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
3334,7,14,Butters Stotch,Hey Lexus.
3335,7,14,Lexus,"Hi, sweetie! Who's this?"
3336,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Wuh it's me, Butters."
3337,7,14,Lexus,"Oh, okay. Hi, cutie. [keeps an eye out for passing customers. Three boys walk by and she covers the phone's receiver] Hey sweetie. [lifts her hand from the receiver] So how are you, honey?"
3338,7,14,Butters Stotch,"I'm fine. I miss you though. [lays on his back, getting comfortable] Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz. [shot of Lexus pouring lemonade into a pitcher] Sometimes I think our classes are too hard. [back to Butters' room] But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?"
3339,7,14,Lexus,"Good, good."
3340,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD."
3341,7,14,Lexus,"Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie. [another Raisins girl comes with glasses to refill, Lexus ] Why don't you just come down to Raisins?"
3342,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times."

3410,7,14,Butters Stotch,Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me [holds on to Lexus] you can say in front of Lexus.
3411,7,14,Linda Stotch,"Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips."
3412,7,14,Butters Stotch,Huh?
3413,7,14,Stephen Stotch,"You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession."
3414,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh, I see. [gets angry] You don't approve of my girlfriend! [Lexus looks off and smiles at somebody] Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad! [walks away from the table with Lexus] Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!"

3416,7,14,Butters Stotch,"... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?"
3417,7,14,Lexus,"I'm sorry, sweetie."
3418,7,14,Butters Stotch,So that's it? We're broken up now?
3419,7,14,Lexus,I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12. [walks off]
3420,7,14,Butters Stotch,Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over. [walks off dejected] Our relationship is o-over.
3421,7,14,Michael,Look at that. Another tortured soul.
3422,7,14,Pete,Another life of pain. [Butters looks up to see the Goths. Stan isn't shown yet.]
3423,7,14,Michael,"Hey Raven, check it out. [Stan, now named Raven, enters the picture]"
3424,7,14,Stan Marsh,Butters?
3425,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh [sniff, wipes away his tears] Uh hey, hey Stan."
3426,7,14,Stan Marsh,What's the matter with you?
3427,7,14,Butters Stotch,"[sobbing] Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me."
3428,7,14,"Goth Kids
 Henrietta Biggle
 Michael
 Pete
 Firkle",Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
3429,7,14,Butters Stotch,Yeah. [sniff] It sure does hurt.
3430,7,14,Michael,That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.
3431,7,14,Pete,Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
3432,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life."
3433,7,14,Stan Marsh,Huh? But you just got dumped.
3434,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like, [sobs] it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid..."
3435,7,14,Pete,Yeah.
3436,7,14,Stan Marsh,"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all."
3437,7,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. [walks off]"
3438,7,14,Stan Marsh,"He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. [walks off]"
3439,7,14,Michael,Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
3440,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[prepares to receive the football] Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!"
3441,7,14,Stan Marsh,"[arrives] Hey, can I join in? [the other boys turn around]"
3442,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
3443,7,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way. [Token and Wendy walk by at this point] Hey Wendy! [Token and Wendy look] You're a bitch,.. Token? [flips him off] Right here, buddy. [Token and Wendy walk off, insulted]"
3444,7,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back."
3445,7,14,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Let's play ball.
3446,7,15,The Broflovskis,"Chanukah, Chanukah, sivivon, sov, sov"
3447,7,15,Ike,I gotta go tinkle.
3448,7,15,Kyle,No Ike! Shh!
3449,7,15,The Broflovskis,"[while Ike and Kyle talk] Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov."
3450,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart. [the doorbell rings] I'll get it. [goes to answer the door. A Canadian couple stands at the entrance]"
3451,7,15,Man,Gerald Broflovski?
3452,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Yes?
3453,7,15,Man,My name is Harry Gintz and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.
3454,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, I can tell."
3455,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption. [Kyle and Ike come into view] We were told that you might be the-"
3456,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","Peter! [rushes in] Oh God, Harry! It's our son! [approaches and kneels. Ike hides behind Kyle] Peter, it's Mommy."
3457,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, what the hell is going on?"
3458,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,I'm not sure.
3459,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz",It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.
3460,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart. [Kyle eavesdrops on the conversation, with Ike at his side] Oh it's so good to see him."
3461,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gintz, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again."
3462,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back."
3463,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,What?
3464,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","We want to take Peter home, to Canada."
3465,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Are you crazy?!
3466,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind."
3467,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home."
3468,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,The new Canadian Prime Minister?
3469,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Look, Ike is our son now!"
3470,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz",He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind.
3471,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,I think you'd better leave.
3472,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","Please, don't make things any harder for Peter."
3473,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!"
3474,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz",We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!
3475,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
3476,7,15,Park County Judge,I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents.
3477,7,15,The Gintzes,Yes!
3478,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz",Yes!
3479,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,No!
3480,7,15,Kyle,[frightened] Ike's not my little brother anymore?
3481,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, do something!"
3482,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,There's nothing I can do.
3483,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Good-bye, Ike. You... [wipes a tear from his eyes] be a good boy, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. [kisses Ike on the head and steps back to console Sheila. Kyle steps forward.]"
3484,7,15,Kyle,"Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?"
3485,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","Come on, Peter, we should get going."
3486,7,15,Ike,[holds onto Kyle] No!
3487,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy."
3488,7,15,Ike,No no no no no!
3489,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz",[whips out a chocolate bar] I have some chocolate.
3490,7,15,Ike,"Chocolate! [rushes for the candy, and Harry settles him inside the car]"
3491,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz",We're going to take good care of him.
3492,7,15,Kyle,"You'd better! [Harry closes the car door and goes to his side, then settles in to drive. The car lunges forward on square wheels. Kyle looks as Ike goes away. Ike looks back] Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? If he knew the situation, he might be-"
3493,7,15,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have."
3494,7,15,Cartman,"Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas."
3495,7,15,Stan,"Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action."
3496,7,15,Kyle,"Guys. [the other boys turn to face him] Guys, I need your help."
3497,7,15,Stan,Sure dude.
3498,7,15,Kyle,"It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone."
3499,7,15,Cartman,"We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!"
3500,7,15,Stan,"Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?"
3501,7,15,Kyle,"Please, you guys, you don't understand. [walks off some distance] My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying."
3502,7,15,Cartman,"Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time."
3503,7,15,Stan,"Dude, Cartman."
3504,7,15,Cartman,"I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all."
3505,7,15,Kyle,"[returns] I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-"
3506,7,15,Stan,"Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. [he, Cartman and Kenny leave. Cartman stops and returns]"
3507,7,15,Cartman,"Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. [walks off in the direction of the other boys. Kyle walks off sadly in the other direction]"
3508,7,15,Crowd,Three! Two! One! [The lights to the Christmas tree are plugged in] Yaaaaay!
3509,7,15,Mayor McDaniels,"As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?"
3510,7,15,Mr Garrison,"How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? [a few seconds of silence]"
3511,7,15,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you ""NO!"""
3512,7,15,Mr Garrison,Rats!
3513,7,15,Chef McElroy,"The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?"
3514,7,15,Cartman,"HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!"
3515,7,15,Liane Cartman,"That's a great idea, Chef."
3516,7,15,Cartman,What?
3517,7,15,Randy,"Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!"
3518,7,15,Stan,"[trying to rein in his dad's enthusiasm] Dad, don't get carried away."
3519,7,15,Mayor McDaniels,"Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. [the crowd cheers and disperses]"
3520,7,15,Cartman,"No! No, this can't be happening! [Kenny, Heidi and Clyde remain there as well. Clyde begins to cry.]"
3521,7,15,Cartman,You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
3522,7,15,Kyle,What?
3523,7,15,Cartman,Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!! [Stan and Kenny walk in behind him] You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!! [lunges after Kyle] AAAAAA!! [Stan and Kenny jump in and hold him back]
3524,7,15,Stan,"Whoa whoa, Cartman."
3525,7,15,Cartman,"It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!"
3526,7,15,Stan,"Cartman, calm down!"
3527,7,15,Kyle,[to Stan] Is that true?
3528,7,15,Stan,"It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined."
3529,7,15,Cartman,"[takes off his mittens and coat] This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now."
3530,7,15,Kyle,"I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money."
3531,7,15,Cartman,You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
3532,7,15,Kyle,"It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this."
3533,7,15,Stan,"Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures."
3534,7,15,Kyle,[reassuring] We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
3535,7,15,Cartman,"Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all."
3536,7,15,Mr Kim,"No business... Christmas time come and nobody wanna eat Chinese food. Looks like I might as well close. [a phone rings. He perks up and runs to get it] Oh boy! Some business! [puts on his chef hat and grabs a notepad] Finally! [grabs the phone and waits for the order] Herro? Shitty Wok, take ur orda prease!"
3537,7,15,Kyle,"Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines."
3538,7,15,Mr Kim,"Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease. [flips a sign over so it now reads ""City Airlines"" and switches to a captain's hat] Herro, Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take ur orda prease?"
3539,7,15,Kyle,"Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible."
3540,7,15,Mr Kim,"Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far. Gonna cost ya a lot of money... hmm let's see. How many people?"
3541,7,15,Kyle,Four.
3542,7,15,Mr Kim,"Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a lot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred dolla."
3543,7,15,Kyle,How about fifty daura?
3544,7,15,Mr Kim,Fifty daura?! You flight to Canada cost at least three thousand dollar!
3545,7,15,Kyle,Fifty-five daura.
3546,7,15,Mr Kim,Hey! Stop wasting my time with fifty-five daura! No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura!
3547,7,15,Kyle,Okay. Sixty daura.
3548,7,15,Mr Kim,Sixty-two daura.
3549,7,15,Kyle,Okay.
3550,7,15,Mr Kim,"Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G."
3551,7,15,Kyle,Got it. [hangs up]
3552,7,15,Mr Kim,"[hangs up, then giggles] Hehehehe, never try to barter with a Chinese man."
3553,7,15,Cartman,We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas. [this sets it at 8 p.m. December 22] That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
3554,7,15,Mr Kim,"Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine. [Stan and Kyle move ahead. Kenny stays with Cartman]"
3555,7,15,Cartman,"[shakes his head vigorously] Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!"
3556,7,15,Kenny,(Me neither!)
3557,7,15,Kyle,Why not?
3558,7,15,Kenny,"('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)"
3559,7,15,Kyle,"You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid."
3560,7,15,Cartman,You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
3561,7,15,Stan,"No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?"
3562,7,15,Cartman,"Of course I care about Christmas- oh, Christ on a stick! [he and Kenny head for the plane]"
3563,7,15,Cartman,"Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!"
3564,7,15,Mr Kim,"Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking. Looking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright. [he turns off the intercom and takes flight after a small bump.]"
3565,7,15,Kyle,All right! We're going to Canada!
3566,7,15,Cartman,Sweet.
3567,7,15,Mr Kim,"Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh! [a sudden noisy dip awakens the boys]"
3568,7,15,Stan,What's going on??
3569,7,15,Mr Kim,"Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking. As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down. Now would be a good time to reflect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you believe in. Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines, and it looks like you made the wrong one. [quickly puts on a parachute and opens his door to drop away]"
3570,7,15,Kyle,"Hey, where the hell are you going?? [Mr. Kim jumps out and away. A few seconds later he pulls the rip cord and the parachute comes out]"
3571,7,15,Stan,"Do something, Kyle! [Kyle grabs the controls and tries to steer the plane]"
3572,7,15,Kyle,I'm trying! [the plane bounces around in the air]
3573,7,15,Cartman,Look out!
3574,7,15,Kenny,"(N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!) [the plane makes a steep descent and crashes onto the ground. It flips over and crumples up, resting near a town. The boys scramble out of the rubble and walk into the town]"
3575,7,15,Stan,"You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. [As they look in one direction, four Canadians pop up from some bushes and look at them. They drop back into the bushes before the boys turn back around]"
3576,7,15,Canadian Man,"Excuse me? [a head pops up over the legs at the bench] Uh, is this an invasion?"
3577,7,15,Kyle,No.
3578,7,15,Canadian Man,"[a doctor, it seems] Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone, it's not an invasion! [people come out of their hiding places. A man pops up out of a manhole mumbling something as the others mill around]"
3579,7,15,Kyle,Hey! We're in Canada!
3580,7,15,Doctor,Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you!
3581,7,15,French Canadians,"Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends loves you!We're just like any other country without the big tattoo!"
3582,7,15,Sailor,"[walks up] We greet thee with pleasure, but one question, if we may?"
3583,7,15,Businessman,[walks up and joins him] What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today?
3584,7,15,Kyle,"Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?"
3585,7,15,French Canadians,"His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there."
3586,7,15,Cartman,Oh Jesus Christ.
3587,7,15,Scott,[shows up] Hey! What the hell is going on?!
3588,7,15,French Canadians,It's Scott! AAAAHHHH! [they all take off in different directions]
3589,7,15,Scott,Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!
3590,7,15,Kyle,Who's that?
3591,7,15,Doctor,That's Scott! He's a dick
3592,7,15,Scott,"[fixes his gaze on the boys and approaches] A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!"
3593,7,15,Doctor,"Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!"
3594,7,15,Scott,"This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! [walks off]"
3595,7,15,Man in Barrel,"God, what a dick!"
3596,7,15,Kyle,"Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?"
3597,7,15,Doctor,The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa. [the other Canadians concur]
3598,7,15,Kyle,So how do we get to Ottawa?
3599,7,15,Wrestler,Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.
3600,7,15,Cartman,Which road?!
3601,7,15,Firefighter,This is Canada. We only have one road. [he moves to one side and the crowd splits in two to allow the boys through]
3602,7,15,Priest,Follow the only road.
3603,7,15,Man,Follow the only road.
3604,7,15,French Canadians,"To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow the only road.
There's only one road in Canada. We call it the Road, the only road.
Hip-hip, hooray, let's hear it for our Road."
3605,7,15,Road Workers,And it's paved and wide and up to code.
3606,7,15,Stan,"All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!"
3607,7,15,Kyle,Word!
3608,7,15,French Canadians,"You're off to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!"
3609,7,15,Doctor,"Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick!"
3610,7,15,French Canadians,"Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck."
3611,7,15,Cartman,[checking his watch] Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. [a mountie appears]
3612,7,15,"Rick, the Mountie","Ahoy there, travelers."
3613,7,15,Kyle,Who are you?
3614,7,15,"Rick, the Mountie","I am Rick, the proud Canadian Mountie. [he's shown riding a sheep]"
3615,7,15,Sheep,Baaaah.
3616,7,15,Stan,I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
3617,7,15,Rick,"[hangs his head a bit] Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride..."
3618,7,15,Sheep,Baaaah.
3619,7,15,Cartman,"But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister."
3620,7,15,Rick,"You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you."
3621,7,15,Kyle,"That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves."
3622,7,15,Rick,"Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!"
3623,7,15,Scott,[monitoring their progress over remote cameras] Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!
3624,7,15,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!"
3625,7,15,Rick,"All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada."
3626,7,15,Kyle,French Canada?
3627,7,15,French Canadians,"[Before them, lots of French Canadians cavort like it's Euro Disney, with circus performers of all stripes doing what they do best.]
There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
Ze ozer Canada is hardly Canada. If you lived here for a day, you'd understand."
3628,7,15,The Mime,Honh honh honnnh! Welcome to French Canada.
3629,7,15,Hockey Player,We have everything your heart could desire. Trapezes. Trampolines. And lots and lots of cheese.
3630,7,15,Artist,[takes off his mustache] Would you like a moustache?
3631,7,15,Rick,"Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. [behind them, two of them walk by. One is dressed in blue and looks a bit like an alien. The other is dressed something like He-Man, with long flowing locks.]"
3632,7,15,Stan,"Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister."
3633,7,15,The Mime,Well first you must answer that phone. [makes his left hand into a phone receiver] Ring-ring. Ring-ring.
3634,7,15,Kyle,We don't have time for this.
3635,7,15,The Mime,"You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call! [holds out his ""phone""] Ring-ring. Ring-ring. [Kyle responds by make his right hand into a phone and answering]"
3636,7,15,Kyle,Hello?
3637,7,15,The Mime,"Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine."
3638,7,15,Artist,[walks up to the boys] How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie!
3639,7,15,Kyle,"Okay, you can come with us."
3640,7,15,The Mime,Honh honnnh! Very good! Let us make haste!
3641,7,15,French Canadians,"[they escort the boys out and on their way with the Mime and the Mountie]
There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.

3642,7,15,The Mime,Is a bullshit Canada
3643,7,15,French Canadians,"If you lived here for a day, you'd understand. [the small group leaves the town behind]"
3644,7,15,The Mime,I think you'd understand. ...You understand.
3645,7,15,Rick,Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!
3646,7,15,The Mime,It reminds me of death and fear.
3647,7,15,Cartman,How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
3648,7,15,Rick,We must be very close now.
3649,7,15,Scott,[jumps out in front of them] Ey! What are you doing?!
3650,7,15,Rick,Waaaah!
3651,7,15,The Mime,Oh no. It's Scott.
3652,7,15,Scott,What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
3653,7,15,Rick,"You're a dick, Scott!"
3654,7,15,Scott,"You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!"
3655,7,15,Fisherman,"[exits a house with a fish in his left hand and a pole in his right] Not so fast, Scott!"
3656,7,15,Scott,Who the hell are you?!
3657,7,15,Fisherman,I'm Steve the Newfoudlander. And you're on Newfoundland property now! Get off before I have you arrested!
3658,7,15,Scott,Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! [leaves in a huff. Steve draws closer to the group]
3659,7,15,Rick,"Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!"
3660,7,15,Kyle,"God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!"
3661,7,15,Steve,"Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal."
3662,7,15,The Mime,"Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away."
3663,7,15,Kyle,"Can we just get going, please?"
3664,7,15,Steve,"Yeah, sure, except there's just one problem."
3665,7,15,Stan,What?
3666,7,15,Steve,You folks are goin' the wrong way.
3667,7,15,Stan,What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
3668,7,15,Steve,Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.
3669,7,15,Rick,"Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is that way. [points behind the group]"
3670,7,15,The Mime,"Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland right!"
3671,7,15,Stan,[grimacing] Oh no!
3672,7,15,Cartman,[glaring at Rick] How could you be so stupid!
3673,7,15,Kyle,There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
3674,7,15,Rick,"It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!"
3675,7,15,The Mime,"Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there. [the three Canadians close their eyes and wish real hard]"
3676,7,15,Rick,[peeks with his left eye] Is it working?
3677,7,15,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down! [puts up his fists] Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! [grabs Kyle by the collar]"
3678,7,15,Steve,"[now in his boat at the end of a dock] Of course, we could always take my boat, eh?"
3679,7,15,Rick,Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!
3680,7,15,Kyle,Well come on! [everyone hops into the boat]
3681,7,15,Steve,"Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister. [the boat leaves the dock and goes on its way]"
3682,7,15,Kyle,Do you think we can still make it in time?
3683,7,15,Cartman,"We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead."
3684,7,15,Here we are at the Parliament buildin,Dialog
3685,7,15,The Mime,Ze Prime Minister is inside.
3686,7,15,Cartman,"[hops off the boat and runs towards Parliament] Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! [the rest of the group follows]"
3687,7,15,The Doorman,Yes?
3688,7,15,Kyle,We need to see the new Prime Minister.
3689,7,15,The Doorman,Ha! Impossible! The new Prime Minister isn't seeing anybody! [slams the window shut]
3690,7,15,The Mime,"Oh well, so much for zat. [turns around and slowly walks away]"
3691,7,15,Steve,"Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? [joins the Mime]"
3692,7,15,Kyle,No. No!! [knocks on the door again. Steve and the Mime turn around]
3693,7,15,The Doorman,[opens his window again] Yes?
3694,7,15,Kyle,"Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me."
3695,7,15,The Doorman,[a big smug] The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business. So you might as well go home. Good-bye!
3696,7,15,Kyle,[turns around and walks off slowly] Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. [sits down on the steps farther away from the door]
3697,7,15,Cartman,And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. [sits on the steps]
3698,7,15,Stan,And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. [sits between the two of them]
3699,7,15,Kenny,(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) [his voice trails off and he joins the others on the steps. They all cry]
3700,7,15,The Doorman,[begins to cry with the boys] Oh please! Please stop crying.
3701,7,15,Cartman,"[through his tears] I'm gonna kill you, Kyle."
3702,7,15,The Doorman,"All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here."
3703,7,15,Kyle,[turns around] Really? [the boys stand and approach the doors]
3704,7,15,The Doorman,"Yes yes. Come in. [opens the large wooden doors, and the group enters.]"
3705,7,15,"Saddam Hussein, the new Canadian Prime Minister",I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want?
3706,7,15,Kyle,"[after a few moments, steps forth] Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-"
3707,7,15,Scott,Not so fast! [soon appears with the Gintses]
3708,7,15,Kyle,Ike!
3709,7,15,Ike,Kyle!
3710,7,15,Scott,"Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!"
3711,7,15,Kyle,"Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. [Harry and Elise look at each other]"
3712,7,15,"Saddam Hussein, the new Canadian Prime Minister","That is a great speech, guy. But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever!"
3713,7,15,Scott,"Haha, you lose, Americans!"
3714,7,15,Rick,"Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses."
3715,7,15,The Mime,And we won't get our wine.
3716,7,15,Steve,"And we can't perform sodomy, eh?"
3717,7,15,Kyle,But why are you making such strange laws??
3718,7,15,"Saddam Hussein, the new Canadian Prime Minister",I SAID GO! [a blast from his holographic eyes incinerates Kenny]
3719,7,15,Kenny,(Aah!)
3720,7,15,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
3721,7,15,Kyle,"[walks over to the charred remains] You... bastards! [brushes off a bit of Kenny from his jacket] Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred? [Stan dusts himself off] And, and takes away mounties' horses? [Stan notices a purple curtain nearby and walks over to it] And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!"
3722,7,15,"Saddam Hussein, the new Canadian Prime Minister","I am the Prime Minister of Canada. [as he says this, Stan pulls the curtain back and Saddam Hussein appears behind it, cramped behind a console] I can do whatever I- [notices his cover is blown] Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend."
3723,7,15,Kyle,"[the other members of the group gather in, as well as other people nearby] What the hell??"
3724,7,15,Rick,"Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!"
3725,7,15,Saddam Hussein,"Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, buddah. I'm not him."
3726,7,15,The Mime,"Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before."
3727,7,15,Soldier 1,Saddam Hussein?
3728,7,15,Soldier 2,He was fooling us?
3729,7,15,Businessman,Get him! [the soldiers quickly seize him and haul him away]
3730,7,15,Saddam Hussein,"Ahh, don't shoot. I want to negotiate. Hey, relax! [the crowd pounces on him and tear him apart] Gah!"
3731,7,15,Rick,Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!
3732,7,15,The Mime,And we can drink our wine.
3733,7,15,Steve,And I can sodomize me boys again
3734,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","[brings Ike over to Kyle] Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way."
3735,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz",Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family.
3736,7,15,"Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz","[gently drops Ike to the floor] Peter, would you like to go back to your home in Colorado? [Ike walks over to Kyle and hugs him. Kyle returns the hug, and the Gintses hug as well, looking at the bond between Kyle and Ike. An alarm goes off. Cartman looks at his watch]"
3737,7,15,Stan,What is that?
3738,7,15,Cartman,It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
3739,7,15,Kyle,"Well yeah, but ah-I got my brother back."
3740,7,15,Cartman,"Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents! [takes off his mittens] And what did I tell you, Kyle?! [unbuttons his jacket, takes it off, and bunches it up] I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! [tosses his jacket away]"
3741,7,15,Kyle,"Dude, come on."
3742,7,15,Cartman,"Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now! [puts up his fists] We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!! [Kyle puts up his fists and gives Cartman a quick right hook across the face. Cartman blinks a few times and begins to bawl] Mooooooom! Moooooooom!"
3743,7,15,Rick,"Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!"
3744,7,15,French Canadians,"Ding dong, they caught Saddam! Merry Christmas to the world!
Ding dong, the Americans caught Saddam!
[Santa's sleigh passes by and the boys are hoisted into it]
Now Canada is free for you and you and me
It's the best Christmas presents we ever got
Canadian Christmas, it's the best! We drink and dance and show our breasts!
Let's celebrate! Saddam Hussein's been caught!"
3745,7,15,Stan,"[sighs] Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. [Cartman holds a towel over his left nostril, which is bleeding]"
