0,16,1,Stan Marsh,"Throw it here! Throw it here! [Clyde throws the ball.] Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! [Clyde's mom shouts through the window.]"
1,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, get up here! Hurry! [Clyde runs in with panic. The boys follow him.]"
2,16,1,Betsy Donovan,[points at the toilet] What is that?
3,16,1,Clyde Donovan,A toilet?
4,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde."
5,16,1,Clyde Donovan,"Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?"
6,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! Put it down! [Clyde hurriedly puts it down. Betsy walks to the door] Thank you. [Clyde stands alone, embarrassed.]"
7,16,1,Eric Cartman,"[whistles] Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom."
8,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,Is your mom always like that dude?
9,16,1,Clyde Donovan,"Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?"
10,16,1,Eric Cartman,"[puts his arm on Clyde] Of course, man. It's cool."
11,16,1,Eric Cartman,"[imitating Clyde's mom] Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! [He laughs, Butters joins him.]"
12,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, it was actually really lame."
13,16,1,Eric Cartman,"I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap."
14,16,1,Butters Stotch,"[laughs] Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out? [looks around] But I thought you sit on the toilet this way. [demonstrates by sitting backwards on his chair] So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No? [turns around] Oh jeez, that's embarrassing."
15,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"[offscreen] Clyde! Clyde! [comes in wearing a nightgown, a coat and slippers] There you are!"
16,16,1,Clyde Donovan,Mom?
17,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant!"
18,16,1,Clyde Donovan,Why?
19,16,1,Betsy Donovan,What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom?
20,16,1,Clyde Donovan,"Mom, I'm in class."
21,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again."
22,16,1,Roger Donovan,"Betsy, come back home. It's just not that big a deal."
23,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina."
24,16,1,Butters Stotch,My grandma is from Virginia. [smiles]
25,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go."
26,16,1,Clyde Donovan,"[Looks down in embarrassment, leaves the classroom.]"
27,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die."
28,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, fatass. I was there."
29,16,1,Eric Cartman,"His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."""
30,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
31,16,1,Eric Cartman,I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
32,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
33,16,1,Eric Cartman,Nuh-uh.
34,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. [police siren is heard offscreen.]
35,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,What's going on?
36,16,1,Stan Marsh,They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
37,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,From what?
38,16,1,Stan Marsh,They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
39,16,1,Fireman 1,Hang it there. You're going to be fine okay? Stay with me now. [Another fireman approaches Roger.]
40,16,1,Fireman 2,"I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do."
41,16,1,Roger Donovan,What?!
42,16,1,Fireman 2,"When she fell into the toilet, she also made it flush. It created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides."
43,16,1,Roger Donovan,Can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing?
44,16,1,Paramedic,"Yes, we'll have to, but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs."
45,16,1,Clyde Donovan,"But she's not gonna die, is she?"
46,16,1,Fireman 2,"Why did you leave the toilet seat up, son?"
47,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"Clyde! Clyde! [Clyde goes next to her.] Clyde, I want you to know I don't blame you for this. We should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up."
48,16,1,Clyde Donovan,"Mom, I'm sorry."
49,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"Shhh! Sh! I.. don't... have a lot of time, Clyde. Just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake, please. Oh, God, please let me go. Let me go. Do it! Do it! Do it! [The third fireman shuts off the plumbing. Betsy screams while her organs are pulled out, then stops, apparently dead.]"
50,16,1,Clyde Donovan,Mom?
51,16,1,Stephen,"I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect. [The camera zooms out. Betsy's corpse in the coffin is seen with a heavy make-up and a pink dress, yet still stuck in the toilet.] What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. [Sharon and Sheila look at each other in disbelief.]"
52,16,1,Linda Stotch,"I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. [all the women start to applause]"
53,16,1,Women,"Yeah, yes. That's right."
54,16,1,Man With Grey Hair,[reads from a paper] Putting the toilet seat down isn't that hard. So is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl?
55,16,1,Woman With Brown Hair,"My God, people. This is a funeral! Please have some respect! There's a little boy here who has lost his mother! [Clyde is shown, looking down in sorrow] He'll never see her again, because he couldn't take that sixth-tenths of a second to put the seat down when he was done peeing. [camera shows the woman again] And now little Clyde's mother is dead, and the blood is on his penis. [organ music is played]"
56,16,1,Terrance & Phillip,"Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip."
57,16,1,Terrance & Phillip,"Oh, hello, Ugly Bob. [the doorbell rings again]"
58,16,1,Ugly Bob,Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.
59,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, get the door! [Liane walks in to answer the door]"
60,16,1,Terrance & Phillip,"You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob."
61,16,1,Ugly Bob,How come you guys say stuff like that?
62,16,1,Terrance & Phillip,Because you're goddamn ugly... [The sound from the TV fades away]
63,16,1,TSA Agent 1,"Hello ma'am, we're the Toilet Safety Administration."
64,16,1,Liane,The what?
65,16,1,TSA Agent 2,"After the recent tragedy, new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security. Can we come in?"
66,16,1,Liane,Oh sure. [The TSA employees come in and go upstairs to the bathroom.]
67,16,1,Eric Cartman,Who are these buttholes?
68,16,1,Liane,"It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty."
69,16,1,Eric Cartman,My potty? What are they going to do to it? [runs upstairs]
70,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! [Liane follows him]"
71,16,1,TSA Agent 1,"Oh yeah, we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am."
72,16,1,Liane,Oh.
73,16,1,TSA Agent 1,"You need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches, but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt."
74,16,1,Liane,Safety belt?
75,16,1,TSA Agent 2,Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.
76,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump."
77,16,1,TSA Agent 2,"This is for your safety. A woman died, you know."
78,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine."
79,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener."
80,16,1,Attorney,"Uh-uh, go on."
81,16,1,Stan Marsh,We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
82,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
83,16,1,Attorney,You can always sue somebody.
84,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet."
85,16,1,Attorney,"You got it. [types on his computer] Here we go, the inventor of the toilet. [the camera shows the webpage he's reading, which turns out to be a Wickie page] Sir Thomas Harrington. In England, died in 1692."
86,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, he's dead?"
87,16,1,Stan Marsh,So then we can't sue him?
88,16,1,Attorney,"Why not? You can always sue somebody. It's just gonna take some special protocol. We would have to perform a sue-ance. [spooky music, lightning and thunder follow]"
89,16,1,Jimmy Valmer,A...a...a...a sue-ance?
90,16,1,Attorney,"You bet. Here at Hoffman and Turk we specialize in suing the dead. If you hire us, we'll work hard, for you."
91,16,1,Stan Marsh,"Wow, really?!"
92,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,[puts his arm around Clyde] You hear that Clyde?
93,16,1,Attorney,Now look. I'll be asking all of you to have a very open mind and a willingness to face you fears. [draws a curtain] I warn you boys. A sue-ance can be very... expensive.
94,16,1,Stan Marsh,How expensive?
95,16,1,Attorney,How much do you have?
96,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
97,16,1,Attorney,"Wow! That's exactly how much a sue-ance costs. [Dramatic music plays. The camera zooms to the man, then pans to the boys.]"
98,16,1,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, that's weird."
99,16,1,Randy Marsh,"Aw, damn it. [reaches the seatbelt. The cop knocks again, so he opens the window.] He, hey officer."
100,16,1,Officer,"If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir."
101,16,1,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh..."
102,16,1,Officer,The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
103,16,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!"
104,16,1,Officer,Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
105,16,1,Randy Marsh,I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. [puts his belt on]
106,16,1,Officer,"The law is the law sir. [hands over the ticket] You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir. [leaves]"
107,16,1,Randy Marsh,Yeah thanks. [under his breath] Asshole.
108,16,1,Officer,[comes up] You say something?
109,16,1,Randy Marsh,"No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. [the cop leaves]"
110,16,1,Eric Cartman,This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
111,16,1,R Booth,"Shoes off, belts off! Sharp objects go in the plastic tray!"
112,16,1,Man 1,This is inhumane.
113,16,1,R Booth,Shut up! Sir.
114,16,1,R Wiley,"Taking a dump today, ma'am?"
115,16,1,Woman 2,"No, just need to pee."
116,16,1,R Wiley,I'll just need to check inside your aaasshole. [Cartman comes in]
117,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!"
118,16,1,R Wiley,"All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir?"
119,16,1,Eric Cartman,What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
120,16,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[flushes and comes out the toilet cabin] Okay, I'm done."
121,16,1,R Wiley,"Alright, sir. I just need to check inside your aaasshole. [takes out a handkerchief and starts wiping his butt]"
122,16,1,Gerald Broflovski,I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
123,16,1,R Wiley,"Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir?"
124,16,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I'm a big boy."
125,16,1,R Wiley,"That's a big boy, sir."
126,16,1,Gerald Broflovski,I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
127,16,1,R Wiley,Yes.
128,16,1,Attorney,"Alright boys, sit down and clear your minds. The sue-ance is about to begin. Doors and windows are locked. You boys have your $500 in cash ready?"
129,16,1,Stan Marsh,[holds the money] Yeah.
130,16,1,Attorney,"Alright. Then I've got this big bowl set here to catch all money we're about to make. Now. Let us start. [holds hands with Jimmy and Clyde, then closes his eyes, so does Jimmy] We call out to the land of the dead. Sir John Harrington. Your presence is requested. Appear to us, John Harrington. We have a subpoena."
131,16,1,Jimmy Valmer,"Jeez, it's not working."
132,16,1,Attorney,"John Harrington. My client is due compensation for negligence. [a creepy music plays. The table starts to rock, much to the Stan and Kyle's surprise.] What is your name, spirit?"
133,16,1,Spirit,"[offscreen] Burns. Jimmy Burns. What's it to you? Who are you, mugs?"
134,16,1,Attorney,"[under his breath] That's how people talked in the past. [to the spirit] We have a claim against a John Harrington. Do you know him, spirit?"
135,16,1,Burns,"Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. Might need a little something to jar my memory."
136,16,1,Attorney,We gotta grease him. Put a hundred in the box. [Stan puts the money. The money disappears with a sparkling effect.]
137,16,1,Burns,"Oh yeah, Harrington. I know him. Always going round inventing things."
138,16,1,Attorney,"Yes, that's him. Is his personage amongst you?"
139,16,1,Burns,"Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't."
140,16,1,Attorney,"Give him another hundred. [Stan puts the money, it disappears like the previous one]"
141,16,1,Burns,"Yeah, I've seen him around, alright. He was just down that way, bragging about some porcelain machine and whatever. [the table rocks]"
142,16,1,Spirit 2,Nooo! Nooooo!
143,16,1,Attorney,"By the power of Christ, we sue you! [fireworks start to pop] By the power of Christ, we sue you!"
144,16,1,Spirit 2,You can't sue me! [the drawers around the room move]
145,16,1,Attorney,"Quick, put the other $300 in the box! [Stan tosses the money. The attorney swings the box, gasping for breath.] This actually went really, really well. Always happens some bureaucrat tries to block the first sue-ance attempt, but this was good. We'll get him tomorrow."
146,16,1,Clyde Donovan,So that's it?
147,16,1,Attorney,"Yeah, we're gonna need about 400 more dollars tomorrow. I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde, but don't worry. We're going to win this thing."
148,16,1,R Wiley,"Put your coffee in the plastic tray please, sir."
149,16,1,R Booth,Shoes off. Belts off.
150,16,1,Randy Marsh,[takes off his gown] Yeah yeah.
151,16,1,R West,Got any metal in your pockets?
152,16,1,R Wiley,I just need to check your asshole.
153,16,1,Randy Marsh,"[sighs, then turns around, lowering his pants] So ridiculous."
154,16,1,R Wiley,[examines his ass with a flashlight] Asshole clear.
155,16,1,Randy Marsh,[puts his pants on] Thanks.
156,16,1,R West,"Pick your coffee up, sir. [Randy picks his coffee, then heads to the toilet]"
157,16,1,R Wiley,"Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can..."
158,16,1,Randy Marsh,"[points away] Hey, what's that thing? [a camera]"
159,16,1,R Wiley,That's a camera. It's a security camera.
160,16,1,Randy Marsh,"Aw, you people have me on camera now?"
161,16,1,R West,"It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location."
162,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms."
163,16,1,People,Yeah.
164,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in."
165,16,1,Mr Garrison,"Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. [the crowd cheers]"
166,16,1,Jimbo,"Alright, let's do it."
167,16,1,Sheila Broflovski,"No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it."
168,16,1,Man 3,"No, we won't."
169,16,1,Woman 3,"Yeah, you will."
170,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?"
171,16,1,Woman 4,"How about we agree to that, if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate."
172,16,1,Stephen,"Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?"
173,16,1,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?"
174,16,1,Man 4,What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?
175,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half."
176,16,1,Man 4,But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him.
177,16,1,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. [several men say 'Yeah' agreeing him]"
178,16,1,Attorney,"Oh, oohh! The spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena. Motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff? Ah, aaaah!"
179,16,1,Jimmy Valmer,What's happening now?
180,16,1,Attorney,"Our motion has been denied by the judge. [the drawers begin to move] Concentrate boys! [holds the box tight. The drawers stop, the attorney heaves a sigh of relief] This specter is like none I have ever encountered. I managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim."
181,16,1,Stan Marsh,So what does that mean?
182,16,1,Attorney,We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.
183,16,1,Kyle Broflovski,[frowning] What?
184,16,1,Attorney,"Hang in there, Clyde. This is all to make the world a safer place."
185,16,1,Monitor Man,Security breeeach!
186,16,1,Reporter,An embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration. Shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through TSA security with a gun and a baby. Leaving the toilet seat up. The head TSA chief of operations had this to say:
187,16,1,R West,Shiiiit!
188,16,1,Reporter,"Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy."
189,16,1,Randy Marsh,What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
190,16,1,Woman 5,And the toilet seat was up.
191,16,1,Randy Marsh,We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
192,16,1,Eric Cartman,That's right.
193,16,1,Randy Marsh,Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
194,16,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
195,16,1,Randy Marsh,It is time for us all to grow up.
196,16,1,Eric Cartman,That's right.
197,16,1,Randy Marsh,It is time for a sue-ance.
198,16,1,People,Yeah.
199,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?"
200,16,1,Reporter 2,"Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor Sir John Harrington. Now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead, lawyers are gonna try and sue him."
201,16,1,Attorney,"Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions."
202,16,1,Spirit,No! No!
203,16,1,Attorney,"You will be sued, spirit. Thy liability is without question. [the table before the attorney moves. Jimmy, Clyde, Cartman, Stan and Kyle are shown sitting there.] Appear before this court, Harrington."
204,16,1,Spirit,Never!
205,16,1,Attorney,"Quick, everyone, get our all your money. [the light goes out and the table rocks. A bright light appears above the judge accompanied by an echoed voice. It turns out to be Betsy's ghost.]"
206,16,1,Betsy Donovan,Clyde? Clyde?
207,16,1,Clyde Donovan,Mom?
208,16,1,Betsy Donovan,[points to the attorney] This lawyer is a fraud. He has been swindling you and your friends for your money.
209,16,1,Attorney,"Fuck me, it's a ghost."
210,16,1,Betsy Donovan,"You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!"
211,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh boy, here we go."
212,16,1,Betsy Donovan,Don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something I have asked you time and time again to do. [camera pans to Clyde] It's your fault!
213,16,1,Spirit 2,[offscreen] Now hold on a second! It's not anyone's fault. [everyone turns to the root of the sound. A spirit enters the court] I am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine.
214,16,1,P Sanchez,"There he is, Sir John Harrington."
215,16,1,Mr Garrison,"Quick, sue him!"
216,16,1,Sir John Harrington,"You can't sue me. [approaches to the toilet cabinet located in the court] You're all using my toilet invention the wrong way. [camera pans to the TSA agents who look at each other] When you have to sit and take a Sir Harrington you're supposed to be facing this way. [sits on it backwards, just like the way Butters did] So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink."
217,16,1,Butters Stotch,A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
218,16,1,Sir John Harrington,"Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look right down at your Harrington to flush. That's gross."
219,16,1,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off."
220,16,1,Sir John Harrington,Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole? [points to the hole in the cabin]
221,16,1,Randy Marsh,That's what that hole is for? Oh. [the people in the room join] Oops.
222,16,1,Eric Cartman,"So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot."
223,16,1,Clyde Donovan,That's not what I said.
224,16,1,Eric Cartman,"Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?"
225,16,1,Eric Cartman,"[his voice comes through the receiver] Clyde, you there? Hello? [Clyde comes off the toilet, flushing it. He waits for a few seconds, then angrily puts the seat up, and leaves the bathroom while flipping off his mother pointing upwards.]"
226,16,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea."
227,16,2,Sharon Marsh,What?! Randy!
228,16,2,Randy Marsh,[shushes her] Just trying to leave without being rude.
229,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"[rolls over to a small table next to the TV. There's a gift-wrapped box on it] Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson. [gets the box and wheels back to the family] Come here, Billy. [meets Stan in the middle of the room] You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy [Stan smiles and glances back at his parents], to impress all the ladies [Stan takes the gift from him, then looks back at his parents]."
230,16,2,Sharon Marsh,"Go ahead and open it, Stan. [Stan opens the gift as Shelly and his parents surround him. Sharon kneels behind him and looks over his shoulder] Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? [she puts it on him - gold base, turquoise center, diamonds surrounding it (12 small, 24 tiny)]"
231,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds."
232,16,2,Randy Marsh,"[approaches Marvin] Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?"
233,16,2,Marvin Marsh,Six thousand dollars.
234,16,2,Randy Marsh,Six thousand?!
235,16,2,Marvin Marsh,It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
236,16,2,Randy Marsh,"Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!"
237,16,2,Sharon Marsh,"It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!"
238,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?"
239,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Nice bolo tie, Stan."
240,16,2,Stan Marsh,[looks away to avoid eye contact] Thanks. [Kyle takes notice]
241,16,2,Eric Cartman,Bolo ties are... [quickly glances at Kyle] really in right now. Cool you have one.
242,16,2,Stan Marsh,"[annoyed] Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money."
243,16,2,Eric Cartman,"No, dude, it's... badass."
244,16,2,Stan Marsh,[angered] It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
245,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,That... was six grand?
246,16,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
247,16,2,Eric Cartman,"...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck."
248,16,2,Stan Marsh,"[finally breaks, facepalming] I know! [lowers his right arm] I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!"
249,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it."
250,16,2,Clerk 1,"You didn't steal this, did you?"
251,16,2,Stan Marsh,"No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash."
252,16,2,Clerk 1,"[does some calculations on his computer] It's 14-karat gold, diamond and turquoise. I'll give you fifteen dollars."
253,16,2,Stan Marsh,...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
254,16,2,Clerk 1,"Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit."
255,16,2,Stan Marsh,Fifteen bucks?!
256,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!"
257,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! [takes back the bolo tie]"
258,16,2,Eric Cartman,"You may suck our collective balls, sir! [they leave the store, turn right and walk]"
259,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
260,16,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah! Here's one. [turns into the next store past the empty lot. The man outside is wearing a signboard]
261,16,2,Clerk 2,"These are real diamonds, right?"
262,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, you can test them."
263,16,2,Clerk 2,Okay. Eight dollars.
264,16,2,Stan Marsh,"[stunned, then angry] This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!"
265,16,2,Clerk 2,[looks it over again] Nine dollars.
266,16,2,Clerk 3,Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos?
267,16,2,Stan Marsh,"I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. [hands the bolo to the clerk. The clerk looks it over, brings out his own pocket scope, and looks it over more closely]"
268,16,2,Clerk 3,"Fourteen-karat gold gets yaaa $14 a gram on the open market, got about... 4 grams here... [puts his scope away] It's not really worth my time. I guess I can give you a six-layer burrito for it."
269,16,2,Stan Marsh,A six-layer burrito?
270,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
271,16,2,Clerk 3,"Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going!"
272,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?"
273,16,2,Dean,"Okay, folks, we are com-, half-way complete with today's broadcast. [scratches his nose] You wanna get in on these deals, call now. Next item is... This is item number 4 5 7 8 1 1 1. [switch to a close-up] Look at these stunning earrings. These are genuine faux sapphire earrings. Fourteen karat gold, 86 carat faux sapphire. Faux is a French word. Got an x in it, but you don't need to pronounce the x. How do you like that for prestigious? These earrings normally go for $6,000,000. We're gonna sell these today fer... [purses his lips together and exhales through them] $320!That's a steal. Now th-oh, there go the phones, they're lightin' up. I believe we have a sale? Do we have a sale? Yea- let's get her on the line. Hello? Who am I speakin' with?"
274,16,2,Vivian,Hello... my name is... Vivian.
275,16,2,Dean,"Vivian, you just got a heck of a deal. What's your last name, sweetheart?"
276,16,2,Vivian,Oh I... I can't remember.
277,16,2,Dean,You can't remember. Well can you remember your credit card number?
278,16,2,Vivian,3 7 1 5-
279,16,2,Dean,"Hold on, Vivivan, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay-"
280,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's terrible!"
281,16,2,Eric Cartman,I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
282,16,2,Stan Marsh,"But, how do they get away with that?"
283,16,2,Eric Cartman,This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. [walks out]
284,16,2,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about?
285,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[standing next to a covered mobile whiteboard] For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. [unveils the equation]"
286,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,That's the chemical equation for gold?
287,16,2,Eric Cartman,"That's right. [goes through and denotes what each letter means] Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. [writes in ""= GOLD"" at the end]"
288,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?"
289,16,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)"
290,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!"
291,16,2,Dean,"Oh my gosh, can you believe this? Somebody's about to get this $20,000 topaz and copper ring for just four thousand bucks. [a close-up of the ring] We've got our buyer on the line. You buyin' this as a gift, sir?"
292,16,2,Caller,"No, I'm buying it as a gift! For my grandson Billy!"
293,16,2,Stan Marsh,Grandpa? [gets off the sofa and runs out the front door]
294,16,2,Dean,"How about that, folks? That is Brazilian emerald, finest emerald available. We're letting this oen go fer... fourteen ninety five [$1495.00 onscreen], EZ Pay. We call it that to save you time. EZ is an abbreviation of easy. Fourteen ninety five, EZ Pay an... What's that? Okay, alright, I just got word, we are droppin' the Z from EZ Pay. It's now just E Pay. [onscreen EZ Pay is erased, then E Pay appears] By usin' the word E Pay instead of takin' all that time to say EZ Pay, we're savin' you a second of time, and those seconds add up. Go ahead and try it: say E Pay five thousand times. That's five thousand seconds, nine hours... we just saved you here on J&G Shoppin' Network. [Grandpa's eyes begin to wander] Not wastin' your time here, you can't afford not to buy this one. You don't have a lot of time left. Literally. Pass this one down to your kids, your grandkids. [Stan appears at the doorway] Show 'em your life had meaning."
295,16,2,Stan Marsh,Grandpa.
296,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"[turns his head to the left to look at Stan] Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? [smiles]"
297,16,2,Stan Marsh,"She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa."
298,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all."
299,16,2,Stan Marsh,"She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen."
300,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy... [faces the TV again, visibly shaken] Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?"
301,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yes, Grandpa."
302,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"[reminiscing with a smile] I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face. [the smile disappears] I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. [gets a headache and rests his head on his left hand]"
303,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! [turns to his left and leaves with determination. Marvin is left looking distressed]"
304,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-"
305,16,2,Butters Stotch,[loses control of the sign] Whoops! [it lands face up on the snow]
306,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[quickly analyzing the situation] Butters, what the fuck?!"
307,16,2,Butters Stotch,"[winces, then massages his right arm] Sorry. My arms hurt."
308,16,2,Eric Cartman,"""My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! [Butters picks the sign up and resumes twirling]"
309,16,2,Leroy Jenkins,Hey! How much will you give me for this? [shows him a ring with a huge rock on it]
310,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh ahhhh, three bucks."
311,16,2,Leroy Jenkins,"Okay. [gives the ring to Cartman, who transfers it to his left hand. Cartman reaches into his back pocket and give Leroy the three dollars. Leroy turns and walks away]"
312,16,2,Eric Cartman,We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
313,16,2,Dean,"And that's it, we just sold this bracelet to Ms. Marcia Tubbs. Martha, thank you so much for your call. You just got yourself a heck of a deal on this one. You there Marcia?"
314,16,2,Marcia Tubbs,[over the phone] Yes. [a car honks at her] I'm lost. I'm lost walkin' on the freeway.
315,16,2,Dean,"Alright, you're lost walkin' on the freeway? Enjoy the Tiger's Eye Aquamarine bracelet. Alri- okay, what should we do next? Oh I see one. Here's a good'un. Lemme... [picks out a ring with a large yellow stone in the middle] Lemme... lemme set the stage for you here: you're goin' to that seniors' cocktail party? It's bingo night and you're lookin' for somethin' to wear? How about a 13 carat panzoto-panzanite ring. This is-oh! We got a caller already on this one! Hello sir, you must be a fan of panzoto-panzanite."
316,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?"
317,16,2,Dean,...What's that?
318,16,2,Stan Marsh,"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?"
319,16,2,Dean,"Okay, we're gonna sell this ring for just thirty-seven ninety five. [$3,795.00 onscreen] How's that? [puts the ring onto a woman's right ring finger.]"
320,16,2,Stan Marsh,I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
321,16,2,Dean,"Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad."
322,16,2,Stan Marsh,No i wouldn't.
323,16,2,Dean,Yes you would.
324,16,2,Stan Marsh,"No, because I really want you to kill yourself."
325,16,2,Dean,"Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?"
326,16,2,Stan Marsh,"I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!"
327,16,2,Dean,"[long silence as the jewelry carousel goes around] Alright, I tell you what: I'll bring the lawsuit down to twenty-nine thirty-nine- [the $6,000,000 is erased and replaced by $2,939.00]"
328,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself."
329,16,2,Dean,"[another long silence, then he clears his throat] Well, you think it's funny, but that's, that's callin' up and tellin' someone to kill themselves; that's not a joke."
330,16,2,Stan Marsh,I'm not joking. [pause] Do it.
331,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5 [actually 55-26177] This is-oh my God, look at this you guys. [shows off the ring Leroy sold him earlier] This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?"
332,16,2,Caller,Hello?
333,16,2,Eric Cartman,"YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?"
334,16,2,Mrs Appleby,This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?
335,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?"
336,16,2,Mrs Appleby,[long pause] I'm sorry?
337,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am."
338,16,2,Mrs Appleby,Thank you.
339,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"""
340,16,2,Mrs Appleby,...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-
341,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth."
342,16,2,Mrs Appleby,Goodbye.
343,16,2,Eric Cartman,Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
344,16,2,Stan Marsh,Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
345,16,2,Manager,"Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places."
346,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: ""Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"""
347,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
348,16,2,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck yeah!)
349,16,2,Manager,"We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually ""Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"""
350,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,What does that mean?
351,16,2,Manager,"""Whoever denied it, [lowers his voice] supplied it."" [the boys are stunned]"
352,16,2,Stan Marsh,"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!"
353,16,2,Butters Stotch,"[looks around at his fellow sign twirlers] We aren't makin' that much, fellas."
354,16,2,Stan Marsh,You're not?
355,16,2,Twirler 1,"Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is ""Whever smelt it dealt it"" [other twirlers agree with him: ""Yeah!"" ""That's right!""]"
356,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[leans forward] Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!"""
357,16,2,Twirler 2,"You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from!"
358,16,2,Twirler 3,"What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean?"
359,16,2,Twirler 4,That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.
360,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Suck my balls, suck my balls... [enters the store] Hello!"
361,16,2,Clerk 4,[An Asian woman] Ohhhh welcoooome! Welcome to discount jewelry stohhhhh! [her two assistants join her as Cartman takes a seat at the counter]
362,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[shoves his briefcase to one side] Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours."
363,16,2,Clerk 4,[claps way too quickly] Ohhhhh you so good foh biiiziness! [points to her brain] You so clehhvahh.
364,16,2,Eric Cartman,"I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings."
365,16,2,Clerk 4,"Okay, what emero do you rike?"
366,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there."
367,16,2,Clerk 4,Ohhhh you make so good chooice! Oh it's beauuutiful! [shows her aides] Look it's beauuutiful! [they too clap way too quickly]
368,16,2,Eric Cartman,"And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred."
369,16,2,Clerk 4,"Oh, that's best one! You so clevohh! [claps quickly a few times] You take advantage o'my low pricess! [claps a few times]"
370,16,2,Eric Cartman,How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
371,16,2,Clerk 4,"You got good eye, [points to her brain] You so clehhvahh. I getting taken advantaaage! You rike to fuck an Asian lady?"
372,16,2,Eric Cartman,[long pause] What d'ja say?
373,16,2,Clerk 4,"I know, you walk by my stoh and you say ""Oh, there's a nice Asian lady. I think I go in and I fuck hurh,"" you Asian-lady fucker you!"
374,16,2,Eric Cartman,Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
375,16,2,Clerk 4,"Oh, I pay thousands! And you come heuh an' fuck me!"
376,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!"
377,16,2,Clerk 4,"Nono, you fucked me!"
378,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!"
379,16,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh sorry, sorry. [looks back at his seat and pulls out the sign. then points it at Cartman. Cartman then hops out and proceeds to the plant, with Butters following]"
380,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[to the receptionist] You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that- [a disturbing sight stops him in his tracks] Motherfucker!"
381,16,2,Stan Marsh,[railing at an older Indian boy] You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! [Kenny and Kyle are with him]
382,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[approaches the other boys] You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!"
383,16,2,Butters Stotch,Sorry! [catches up to him]
384,16,2,Eric Cartman,-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
385,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!"
386,16,2,Eric Cartman,"No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!"
387,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa! [the boy reaches for a necklace and offers it to Stan] No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! [the boy thinks about what to do with the necklace, then reaches for a small plastic pouch and puts it in. The boy motions to another boy]"
388,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,What's he doing?
389,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work."
390,16,2,Stan Marsh,"So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it."
391,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend."
392,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. [hands him the gift]"
393,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, for me? [takes the gift and unwraps it] Oh! My God. There she is. [a picture of Grandpa in younger days with his dog] Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot. [they smile at each other for a moment] Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?"
394,16,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
395,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck."
396,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore."
397,16,2,Marvin Marsh,That's a good idea. [looks back at the picture and smiles. Stan looks down and away]
398,16,2,Dean,"Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello?"
399,16,2,Caller 1,[long pause] What are you waiting for? Kill yourself.
400,16,2,Dean,"Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself."
401,16,2,Caller 1,He was right. Do it.
402,16,2,Dean,"Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry ? Yes. Hello, sir?"
403,16,2,Caller 2,"You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls."
404,16,2,Dean,Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it.
405,16,2,Caller 2,"New, you're scared. You got, you got lady balls. [hangs up. The dial tone is heard and Dean moves on to the next call]"
406,16,2,Caller 3,Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings?
407,16,2,Dean,Yes ma'am!
408,16,2,Caller 3,They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself?
409,16,2,Dean,"Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?!"
410,16,2,Caller 3,Put it against your temple and pull the trigger. [long pause. The gun is cocked and then goes off. A thump is heard and blood lands all over the set. The soothing music plays on]
411,16,3,Mitt Romney,"I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way."
412,16,3,Rick Santorum,I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
413,16,3,Newt Gingrich,"What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama."
414,16,3,Ron Paul,"We faced something much much greater after World War II. [the camera pans to Stan, who is in the audience] We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs-"
415,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Tango, Tango, I'm in position."
416,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[offscreen] Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?"
417,16,3,Stan Marsh,It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
418,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Butters. Bring it in."
419,16,3,Butters Stotch,"[going through a hallway with a trolley] Equipment is flying in, ten seconds."
420,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman."
421,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[in a wooden dark place with two wires on the ground] I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go."
422,16,3,Agent 1,We might have a problem.
423,16,3,Agent 2,What's that?
424,16,3,Agent 1,We just got word somebody might try to Faith Hill this event.
425,16,3,Agent 2,"Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch! [raises his fists and walks away. The stage is shown through Stan's angle. Three other agents step on the stage.]"
426,16,3,Stan Marsh,"I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this. [Butters takes a plate from the trolley, which has an iPhone on it, and walks to the left. Meanwhile Kenny comes from the opposite direction, taking the iPhone and passing it to Stan.] I got it."
427,16,3,Agent 3,"Hey, somebody is under the stage."
428,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,Go Cartman! [Cartman runs up and comes on the stage. He cheerfully pulls his shirt out near the nipple area. Stan takes a picture. Four agents come up to chase Cartman.]
429,16,3,Butters Stotch,We got it. We got it!
430,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Go, go, go."
431,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. [The agents run after them.]"
432,16,3,Reporter,"First, there was planking. [various images of people planking come up] People taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the Internet. Planking was soon replaced by owling. [a picture of a boy with his knees drawn to his chest] And after the Super Bowl by Bradying. [New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as well as an overweight man, both sitting on the ground with their legs straight out, hands clasped and looking down] But the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs. [Cartman pulling out his shirt at the debate is shown, this time fullscreen] It's called Faith Hilling. And all around the world people are doing it. [A black boy pulling his red shirt, then a ginger boy with a cap doing the exact same thing with his grey-and-white sweatshirt] Kids, adults, and even notable celebrities are getting into the act. [L.A. Lakers player Kobe Bryant is shown pulling on his jersey. The news studio comes to view again.] But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it?"
433,16,3,Professor Lamont,"I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire! [the children are listening to him, Cartman has a bored look] Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of Bradying. From football quarterback to football singer."
434,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late."
435,16,3,Professor Lamont,"[lowers the screen] I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across. [projects the film]"
436,16,3,Speaker,For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called Tebowing [The caption TEBOWING appears in the middle of the screen].
437,16,3,Speaker,[offscreen] This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous Tebowing can be.
438,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.
439,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,"I don't know, Ryan. You sure this is a good idea? [Ryan walks onto a railway]"
440,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,"Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second. How could I get hurt? [kneels down and puts his right elbow on his right knee, closing his eyes as well as pinching his nose bridge]"
441,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,"Okay, hold still. [puts up his iPhone. A train horn is heard.] What's that?"
442,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,A traaain! AAAAAA! [Barkley and Ryan continue to scream and look around while staying in the same position. The train is still off in the distance.]
443,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,RYAN!
444,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,"No, no! Nooo! No, no, no, no, noooo! [The train finally comes at full force and hits Ryan, severing him in half and covering Barkley in blood. In the classroom, Butters screams after what he has seen.]"
445,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,RYAN!
446,16,3,Ryan and Barkley,Learn from me. [dies]
447,16,3,Woman 1,"This sure is a nice car, Tommy. [raises her iPhone] Would you like to get a picture of me Tebowing in it?"
448,16,3,Tommy and his wife,"Sure. [gets the iPhone to take her picture. As the woman poses, the train's headlight appears in the distance and its horn is heard.] What is that?"
449,16,3,Woman 1,"Oh my God, it's coming!"
450,16,3,Tommy and his wife,"God no! [he exits the car while she continues Tebowing inside, revealing that they parked on the railroad track] No, no!"
451,16,3,Woman 1,"[scared] Tommy, d-did you get the picture?"
452,16,3,Tommy and his wife,"Hold on, wait, hold on! [hurriedly presses on the iPhone, then gets ready to take the picture]"
453,16,3,Woman 1,"Hurry, hurry! AAAAA! [The train finally comes at full force and crushes the car as Tommy runs off. Her bloody, severed head then lands onto a dirt field next to the track and her mouth opens] Aaah! [The classroom. Butters screams again in horror.]"
454,16,3,Man 1,"Be careful up there, Pete."
455,16,3,Pete,"[Tebowing on top of a wall with graffiti in a residential area] Just go on and take the picture. [the wall is suddenly destroyed by a train, killing Pete and knocking his friend down, before he quickly gets up and looks on in horror. Butters in the classroom screams.]"
456,16,3,Speaker,"These youths paid with their lives for Tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs [puts his index and middle fingers up], bunny ears [raises his arm while keeping the previous gesture] and fake wiener [turns his body sideways, bends his left arm and leg] Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you. Maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and Tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future, [a blue screen comes to view while the following words of the speaker gets typed] get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember.  [a photo of three teenagers from the 1980s. The following lines are sung] Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. Peace signs! Bunny ears! Fake wiener! [the three memes are demonstrated by the photos of the teenagers performing them.]"
457,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[yawns] Oh, God. That was boring."
458,16,3,Kenny McCormick,(Totally!)
459,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"So, what do you want to do now?"
460,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there."
461,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, that's a good idea."
462,16,3,Butters Stotch,What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
463,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation."
464,16,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, count me out."
465,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?"
466,16,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, I'm scared. [Craig shows up]"
467,16,3,Craig Tucker,"Hey, did you see today's newspaper?"
468,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?"
469,16,3,Craig Tucker,You guys made the front page.
470,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Really? [the boys excitedly run, except for Butters]"
471,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we are on the front page!"
472,16,3,Eric Cartman,Yes!
473,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, dude!)"
474,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Can we get a different pose, please? [hands the clerk two dollars and gets the paper]"
475,16,3,Eric Cartman,"What's it say, what's it say?"
476,16,3,Stan Marsh,"It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late."
477,16,3,Eric Cartman,"What? Let me see that. [the newspaper has Cartman's pictured and a headline 'Faith Hilling so 2,000 late']"
478,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,How can that be? Already?
479,16,3,Stan Marsh,[reads the newspaper] Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
480,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
481,16,3,Stan Marsh,"[continues reading] ""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."""
482,16,3,Eric Cartman,Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
483,16,3,Stan Marsh,That's all it is? [Kenny moves to the left-hand side]
484,16,3,Eric Cartman,You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. [shows three other guys' pictures]
485,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,But that's stupid. [Kenny moves to the right-hand side] How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
486,16,3,Eric Cartman,"I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage. [shows a couple of more pictures] This has to be stopped, you guys."
487,16,3,Boy 1,"[giggles] Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. [the iPhone screen is shown as Cartman photobombs while Faith Hilling.]"
488,16,3,Eric Cartman,"How is this Kyle? This good? [the boy moves away a bit. The other kids are stunned. The boys stand next to them, Kyle having an iPhone in his hands]"
489,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yep, that's great. [glances at the other kids]"
490,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[continues moving as the other boy tries to get past him] Cool, these will be good uploads."
491,16,3,Boy 2,"Hey, what are you doing?"
492,16,3,Eric Cartman,Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
493,16,3,Boy 1,Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
494,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe."
495,16,3,Boy 2,[starts to crawl away] Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else. [Cartman continues to cover his view] [to Cartman] Knock it off!
496,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Why don't you make me? [the boy punches him, Cartman responds by hitting him on the ground. Stan and Kyle begin to punch Boy 1 while Kenny attacks the girls.]"
497,16,3,Professor Lamont,"Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe. [the boys glance at each other] Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed! [puts the gun on Butters' desk] That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up."
498,16,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh, that's okay. I think..."
499,16,3,Professor Lamont,Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and Hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
500,16,3,Kids,"Yes, sir."
501,16,3,Professor Lamont,Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
502,16,3,Butters Stotch,HA?!
503,16,3,Professor Lamont,"Hey! You're following plankers and Tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT! [Butters hesitantly puts the gun in his mouth] Everybody take a good look. [points to Butters] This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. You're playing roulette with your lives! [A hawk is heard offscreen. Two men enter the classroom.]"
504,16,3,Man 2,"Professor Lamont, we need to talk."
505,16,3,Professor Lamont,I will be right back. [leaves the classroom]
506,16,3,Man 2,"You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont."
507,16,3,Professor Lamont,"Yes, what is this about? [puts his bag on the table]"
508,16,3,Man 3,"We need your expertise, sir."
509,16,3,Man 2,"Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?"
510,16,3,Professor Lamont,Another species? What are you talking about?
511,16,3,Man 3,"We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand... [types on his laptop] this. [turns around the laptop. Professor Lamont puts on his reading glasses to look at the screen, which shows various cats with breads around their heads.] Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us."
512,16,3,Professor Lamont,They're evolving. Cats are evolving. [moves the cursor down to see more pictures]
513,16,3,Man 3,Sorry?
514,16,3,Professor Lamont,"There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt."
515,16,3,Man 2,We're having a hard time following you here.
516,16,3,Professor Lamont,[opens a book] Look. In the 70s there was fonzing. [the book page has two people's pictures with their thumbs up] Which replaced the outdated mustaching. [a guy with his index finger above his lips] In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting. [people raising their fists up to the sky] But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s. [the Nazis doing their trademark salute] Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking. [an Ancient Egypt painting]
517,16,3,Man 2,You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
518,16,3,Professor Lamont,"[walks to the front] If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures, [takes his glasses off] they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. [dramatic music plays]"
519,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this? [Mr. Kitty looks at him] You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty. [closes his laptop and approaches Mr. Kitty] Bad Mr. Kitty. [Cartman hits Mr. Kitty with a stick. Mr. Kitty hisses, then paws at him.] Bad kitty! No more memeing! [walks away] Come on, guys. [the boys walk out of the room. Cartman turns his back to scold his cat again] Bad Mr. Kitty!"
520,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Well, I'm glad we took care of that."
521,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?"
522,16,3,Eric Cartman,I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
523,16,3,Stan Marsh,That's a cool idea
524,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"[sighs] (Oh, fuck it, dude.) [walks away]"
525,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"W-what's the matter, Kenny?"
526,16,3,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
527,16,3,Stan Marsh,What seems pointless?
528,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)"
529,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! [the boys approach Kenny] Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?"
530,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)"
531,16,3,Stan Marsh,"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap."
532,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her."
533,16,3,Reporter,"Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say ""Oh Long Johnson"" on video before getting out of the way."
534,16,3,Boy 3,"You ready, you ready?"
535,16,3,Boy 4,"[offscreen] I'm recording, go."
536,16,3,Boy 3,[the machine throws balls. The boy stands in front of them] Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. O-Oh Long- [gets hit by a ball]
537,16,3,Boy 4,Larry!
538,16,3,Reporter,"This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety."
539,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
540,16,3,Reporter,The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death.
541,16,3,Stan Marsh,Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
542,16,3,Boy 1,"[his fellows are standing besides him. He has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way."
543,16,3,Stan Marsh,"[continues to crawl around] Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- [he is confronted by Stan, Kyle and Kenny]"
544,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what's going on?"
545,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? [hurriedly puts his pants on]"
546,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?"
547,16,3,Boy 1,"He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff."
548,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out."
549,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?"
550,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,Benedict Arnold. [the three boys walk away]
551,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay? [the boys stop] You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. [Kenny looks down]"
552,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny?
553,16,3,Kenny McCormick,"[approaches Stan and the other boys] (I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)"
554,16,3,Boy 1,"If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. [he and his friends walk away]"
555,16,3,Stan Marsh,"You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. [Kenny pulls down his pants and starts crawling on his butt.]"
556,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,You guys are sellouts.
557,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[holds him] Come on, Kyle."
558,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,You're freaking sellouts!
559,16,3,Eric Cartman,"It's okay, man, come on."
560,16,3,Professor Lamont,What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire? [the black cat is kept in a cage]
561,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
562,16,3,Professor Lamont,"Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?"
563,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Jeeea-
564,16,3,Professor Lamont,You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
565,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh oh oh.
566,16,3,Reporter 2,"Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival. [walks to a railway] A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it ""reporting"". And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal. [train horn] Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. [gets hit by the train]"
567,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more. [Cartman raises his left hand a bit] Yeah, yeah freeze there. [a man comes into view with his little son]"
568,16,3,Little Boy,"What are those boys doing, daddy?"
569,16,3,Dad,"Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time."
570,16,3,Little Boy,How droll. [The man and boy leave the scene. Cartman and Kyle look down for a moment]
571,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Get a couple facing the other way, brah. [turns the other way]"
572,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, good idea. [a doctor comes out of the clinic]"
573,16,3,Doctor,"Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine. [giggles] Get it? [goes back to his clinic. A man with a car sounds his horn]"
574,16,3,Man 4,Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!
575,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Cartman] We have to face it, Cartman."
576,16,3,Eric Cartman,"I know. I know Kyle. [stops lifting his ""nipples"" up]"
577,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,I really thought it was gonna last.
578,16,3,Eric Cartman,I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change. [starts crying] The sun hurts my eyes. [wipes away his tears]
579,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
580,16,3,Eric Cartman,"No, no. It was kind of stupid, really."
581,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,I-It's good that it became something else.
582,16,3,Eric Cartman,And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. [both of them sigh]
583,16,3,Reporter,"Household cats have evolved into a species as intelligent as humans. Will this mean war between our two life forms? In an attempt to try and communicate with the leader of cats, experts have sent in the ambassador of people."
584,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Hello.
585,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
586,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,"Meow, meow."
587,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
588,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Long Johnson.
589,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
590,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Oh Long Johnson.
591,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh- Oh Don Piano.

596,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,Oh Lala Lionde. Oh Long John- Don Piano. Don Piaaaano.
597,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson. [the ambassador closes the door]
598,16,3,Ambassador of Humans,"I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children."
599,16,3,Stan Marsh,"[has the iPhone in his hands, while Kyle and Kenny stand next to him] Okay, that's good, a little higher."
600,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[he is doing a combination of Taylor Swifting and Cat Breading] Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?"
601,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that's awesome."
602,16,3,Stan Marsh,"OK, whenever you're ready."
603,16,3,Mr Kitty,Meow.
604,16,3,Eric Cartman,"No, kitty, you have to be quiet."
605,16,3,Mr Kitty,Meow.
606,16,3,Eric Cartman,No kitty! That's a bad kitty! [Boy 1 and his friends come over]
607,16,3,Boy 1,"Wow, what's this?"
608,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting."
609,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Alright, go Cartman."
610,16,3,Eric Cartman,[begins to crawl while holding Mr. Kitty] Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
611,16,3,Girl 1,That's pretty cool.
612,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome."
613,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,It's super awesome.
614,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time."
615,16,3,Mr Kitty,"Meow, meow."
616,16,3,Eric Cartman,"SHUT UP, KITTY!"
617,16,3,Reporter 3,"With the inevitable species war looming, our country's brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats. It's called putty-whistling. And the question on everyone's mind... Who will be the first person to die from it? [Rick, Mitt, Newt and the cat are standing behind their lecterns.]"
618,16,3,Mitt Romney,"W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago..."
619,16,3,Rick Santorum,If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-
620,16,3,Newt Gingrich,To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington.
621,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
622,16,3,Newt Gingrich,I started working in the governor wing in 1974.
623,16,3,The Talking Cat,[Rick and Newt talk] Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Piaano.
624,16,3,Newt Gingrich,I'm gonna say two things...
625,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
626,16,3,Mitt Romney,"I have five sons, five daughters in law, sixteen grand kids, and they're the joy of my life."
627,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Lalalonde.
628,16,3,Newt Gingrich,I was wrong when I figured it out. You were wrong when you didn't.
629,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
630,16,3,Rick Santorum,"It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-"
631,16,3,Stan Marsh,"[the debate goes on. The camera pans to Stan, again in the audience] Fox trot standing by at position alpha."
632,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango."
633,16,3,Kenny McCormick,(This is Tango. I have the goods.)
634,16,3,Stan Marsh,Standing by in three seconds.
635,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Two, one. Go Cartman!"
636,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Let's do this. [he runs to the hallway, where Kenny hands him Mr. Kitty. He goes to the stage with Mr. Kitty, and pulls down his pants as Stan is ready to record him. He then stops, thinking.]"
637,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman? Go, Cartman."
638,16,3,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude. Hurry."
639,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[softly] No. NOO! [puts his pants back on] I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this. [puts down Mr. Kitty] And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. [he turns sideways and snaps his fingers a few times, then pulls up his shirt, Faith Hilling.]"
640,16,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[observing him though a computer] Yeah. Do it, Cartman."
641,16,3,Eric Cartman,"[music begins to play]
Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two."
642,16,3,Stan Marsh,Wow!
643,16,3,Eric Cartman,We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
644,16,3,Man 5,Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good?
645,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
[the audience and Rick, Mitt and Newt join him]
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do."
646,16,3,The Talking Cat,Oh Long Johnson.
647,16,3,Eric Cartman,"Is a meme I will fight
[Stan is joined by Kyle and Kenny in the audience. Butters is in the wooden classroom dancing to the song, yet still has the gun in his mouth]
 'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die."
648,16,3,Reporter 3,"And so in the face of war a little boy reminds us all what being human really means. The message is unclear. But it doesn't matter as long as you give the audience a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with boobies. It's called pandering and all over the country people are- [train horn] Oh! Oh Long Johns- [gets hit by the train]"
649,16,4,Sheila Broflovski,"[talking to someone] Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner. [Kyle takes his bowl and heads to the dining table] Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.[he walks past the living room, where Cartman and Sheila are shown talking]"
650,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?"
651,16,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday."
652,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? [Kyle stops and starts listening]"
653,16,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. [Kyle rushes to the entrance]"
654,16,4,Eric Cartman,"So interesting, wow. [he and Sheila are drinking tea]"
655,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Cartman, angrily] Get out of here."
656,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hey, Kyle."
657,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,Get. Outta here! [points his finger to the left]
658,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton."
659,16,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, you're very welcome."
660,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,[walks to him] What are you gonna do?
661,16,4,Eric Cartman,Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
662,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,No?
663,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright, Kyle, listen. [comes forward with Kyle, then sighs] Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park."
664,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,What does that have to do with Passover?
665,16,4,Eric Cartman,"All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever. [Cartman announces the special within the episode] ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! [creepy music plays]"
666,16,4,The Easter Egg Hunt Attendant,"Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt? [Stan is in the front of the line]"
667,16,4,Butters Stotch,[at the middle of the line] Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
668,16,4,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday."
669,16,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Me, too.)"
670,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[anxious] Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all."
671,16,4,Craig Tucker,Jewpa what?
672,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything."
673,16,4,Craig Tucker,"Okay. [to Token and Kenny] So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?"
674,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter."
675,16,4,Butters Stotch,"You mean it's like, like a monster?"
676,16,4,Eric Cartman,"It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls..."
677,16,4,Token Black,Nuh-uh!
678,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[angrily points at him] Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!"
679,16,4,Clyde Donovan,"[offscreen] You guys, check this out! [Butters, Kenny, Craig and Token go there to take a look. On the ground lies a dead bird.]"
680,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[keeps the boys away] Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell."
681,16,4,Butters Stotch,"AAAAAAHHH! [scared as hell, flees]"
682,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing."
683,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies."
684,16,4,Eric Cartman,I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
685,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
686,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch."
687,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[sighs] If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!"
688,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up. [a loud peal of thunder] It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways."
689,16,4,Eric Cartman,[standing on his bed with camera kit attached to him] Butters.
690,16,4,Butters Stotch,AAAAAHHH!
691,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera."
692,16,4,Butters Stotch,"No, it's a school night!"
693,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro! [Butters stammers a bit] I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real."
694,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in."
695,16,4,Butters Stotch,You think Jewpacabra is here?
696,16,4,Eric Cartman,Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
697,16,4,Butters Stotch,Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
698,16,4,Eric Cartman,"You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ. [a rustle comes through the bush] Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING! [to Butters] He's here somewhere."
699,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh God, I'm scared."
700,16,4,Eric Cartman,JESUS IS A LIE!
701,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Eric, stop it!"
702,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Shh! Help me call it out, Butters."
703,16,4,Butters Stotch,I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
704,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?! [Butters thinks] THERE IS NO CHRIST!"
705,16,4,Butters Stotch,Jesus is a lie?
706,16,4,Eric Cartman,"No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?"
707,16,4,Butters Stotch,Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
708,16,4,Eric Cartman,Sh! You hear that?
709,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh, hamburgers."
710,16,4,President,We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!
711,16,4,Eric Cartman,"I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video. [connects his video camera to the TV] What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra. [moves away a bit] And you're the first to see it. [the video shot of Butters and Cartman from last night is played on the TV] This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this. [pauses] 'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for... [an abrupt rustle] right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again. [plays that moment again] Wait for it... wait... there! [pauses to show the motion blurred animal that moves between bushes] Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us."
712,16,4,Employee 1,That wasn't a dog?
713,16,4,Eric Cartman,"It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins."
714,16,4,Employee 2,What?
715,16,4,Eric Cartman,"I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. [the president walks to the window. Employee 1 follows him]"
716,16,4,Employee 1,Mr. Billings?
717,16,4,Mr Billings,"[sighs] There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?"
718,16,4,Peters and Other Sooper Foods Employees,I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%.
719,16,4,Mr Billings,[deep sigh] We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs.
720,16,4,Mr Billings,So where are we heading first?
721,16,4,Eric Cartman,"We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. [points on the map]"
722,16,4,Mr Billings,The Bahamas?
723,16,4,Eric Cartman,That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
724,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! [drops in a pool, then comes out]"
725,16,4,Mr Billings,Where to now?
726,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Now we head back to Colorado, here. [points on the map] We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it."
727,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
728,16,4,Eric Cartman,"People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron."
729,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid."
730,16,4,Eric Cartman,"These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!"
731,16,4,Matt,Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right. [highlights the blurred image of the supposed Jewpacabra]
732,16,4,Cliff,"It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo?"
733,16,4,Bobo,Bobo thinks scary!
734,16,4,Matt,It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch.
735,16,4,Cliff,It's not big enough to be a Squatch.
736,16,4,Matt,So it's a baby Squatch?
737,16,4,Cliff,That's what I'm thinking.
738,16,4,Eric Cartman,I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
739,16,4,Matt,Jewpacabra?
740,16,4,Eric Cartman,"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy."
741,16,4,Bobo,"Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary!"
742,16,4,Cliff,"But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left."
743,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified."
744,16,4,Mr Billings,All the kids will be so disappointed.
745,16,4,Bobo,"Whoa, look at this! I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video! It's all orangie! [the image of Jewpacabra is colored in orange]"
746,16,4,Cliff,But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!
747,16,4,Eric Cartman,Heh. What do you mean? [he is stunned]
748,16,4,Cliff,We've never seen this before! It really is true!
749,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?"
750,16,4,Matt,No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it... [drops an cut-out image of a dog] That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it.
751,16,4,Bobo,That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals!
752,16,4,Matt,"That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell."
753,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive."
754,16,4,Matt,"I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave."
755,16,4,Eric Cartman,Why?
756,16,4,Cliff,'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that.
757,16,4,Matt,"If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you. [Cartman is scared a lot. Creepy music plays]"
758,16,4,Eric Cartman,"There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real. [loud thunder] Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah. [quickly makes a call with his cellphone] Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real? [Kyle is listening to him in his bed with his eyes half-closed] I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?"
759,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing?
760,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? [Kyle hangs up and goes back to sleep. His phone rings again, causing him so throw it to the wall.]"
761,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect

 [speaks on his radio] Everything still clear out there?"
762,16,4,Eric Cartman,[voice only] Guys?!
763,16,4,Butters Stotch,"It's all quiet out front, Eric."
764,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!"
765,16,4,Butters Stotch,"He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. [a boom breaks out. The three boys take to their heels, screaming]"
766,16,4,Eric Cartman,[in the church] What? What was that? Butters? Token?! [the door is forced] Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh! [quickly hides between the candle stands] You guys?! GUYS!
767,16,4,Butters Stotch,"[though the radio] Hey, Eric."
768,16,4,Eric Cartman,It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
769,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. [he is definitely at Wingstreet, and Craig and Token are buying some meal]"
770,16,4,Eric Cartman,Wingstreet?!
771,16,4,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide."
772,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I want wings! [there is some knocking on another door] Ahghgh!!! [it turns out to be Mr. Billings and his two employees.] Oh Jesus, it's only you!"
773,16,4,Mr Billings,"Alright, grab him."
774,16,4,Eric Cartman,HUH?!
775,16,4,Employee 3,"You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you. [the two employees take him away]"
776,16,4,Eric Cartman,Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
777,16,4,Mr Billings,"Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice."
778,16,4,Eric Cartman,"OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME! [Employee 3 brushes his face with the blood of a chicken which is in the bucket he holds] What the-?"
779,16,4,Mr Billings,Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
780,16,4,Eric Cartman,This isn't safe or fun!
781,16,4,Mr Billings,"Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay? [a howl is heard] Oh fuck, we better get out of here. [Mr. Billings and his employees flee away]"
782,16,4,Eric Cartman,"NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!"
783,16,4,Mr Billings,"Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company. [Kyle just looks] But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you. [the three walk away. Kyle looks behind them]"
784,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[smiles] Kyle! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks at him with his eyes half-closed] I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance."
785,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go."
786,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble! [Kyle frowns and walks away] No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money! [softly] Oh God, what am I doing? [shouts] I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke! [softly] Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble."
787,16,4,Eric Cartman,It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome. [he is peeked by a pair of red slanted eyes with a snoring effect.] I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! [the pair of eyes turn out to be binoculars used by Bobo.]
788,16,4,Cliff,"What'dya think, Bobo?"
789,16,4,Bobo,No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man!
790,16,4,Matt,I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo!
791,16,4,Bobo,"Bobo shoot it! [he comes forward to aim, Cartman notices]"
792,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Bobo?! Bobo, no! [Bobo fires a dart] Wha- [falls over]"
793,16,4,Bobo,[dances cheerfully] Bobo got it! Bobo got the bunnymaaan!
794,16,4,Matt,"Good shot, Bobo!"
795,16,4,Cliff,Now what do we do?
796,16,4,Matt,I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet.
797,16,4,Cliff,Good idea. [they start walking] Wait wait wait wait. We're gonna need to take the evidence.
798,16,4,Bobo,Alright. [takes the dart gun] I got the evidence right here. The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with.
799,16,4,Matt,"Alright! Come on, let's go!"
800,16,4,Eric Cartman,[seems to be having a dream] Ugh... what... where...
801,16,4,Eric Cartman,Ugh... what? [stands up] What's going on?
802,16,4,Man 1,The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
803,16,4,Eric Cartman,"It's raining frogggggsss! [finds Kyle, who is clinbing to the roof of his house on a ladder] Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?"
804,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,[bangs a nail into a piece of wood] Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
805,16,4,Eric Cartman,"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle."
806,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!"
807,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind."
808,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
809,16,4,Eric Cartman,What does that mean?
810,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
811,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?"
812,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's just how God is.
813,16,4,Eric Cartman,"You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! [Kyle gets angry]"
814,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?"
815,16,4,Pharaoh,"It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear."
816,16,4,Eric Cartman,"But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave."
817,16,4,Pharaoh,"[sighs] It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA?"
818,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. [a bloody frog lands over the edge]"
819,16,4,Pharaoh,Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.
820,16,4,Eric Cartman,"But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys."
821,16,4,Pharaoh,"Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children."
822,16,4,Eric Cartman,"I love you, dad."
823,16,4,Pharaoh,And I love you son. And our love grows.
824,16,4,Eric Cartman,And our love grows
825,16,4,Both,"And our love grows
Like the mighty river of the Nileriver of the Nile
See it flow
We'll never be apart"
826,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children

 [he pats a lamb, but it is taken away by Gerald] Huh? [Sheila slices the lamb's head] Nooooooo! [Sheila and Gerald apply the lamb's blood to their door. Kyle watches them] Kyle, why? What are you doing?"
827,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,This is what God told us to do!
828,16,4,Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle! I don't believe you!"
829,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,You'll see! [Cartman runs away but realizes other families are also doing it. He runs though the corpses of lambs]
830,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Noooo! [goes inside somewhere, but sees two kids with bloody eyes]"
831,16,4,Kid 1,What's happening to us? [both of the kids puke blood and fall over]
832,16,4,Eric Cartman,Noooooo! [runs past a mom and her child]
833,16,4,Child,Mom! Don't let God kill me! [his head explodes and his mom screams]
834,16,4,Eric Cartman,Noooo! [he is confronted by a man]
835,16,4,Man 2,[holds out a flat sandwich] Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
836,16,4,Eric Cartman,No! The bread's all flat! No! [shoves the bread down and keeps running] Aaaaahhhh! [the Pharaoh has kneeled down. All children around him have their heads explode. Screaming and shouting can be heard in the background]
837,16,4,Pharaoh,Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG!
838,16,4,Eric Cartman,"We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! [his head explodes, and the Pharaoh crys in despair]"
839,16,4,Eric Cartman,[sleeptalking] No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
840,16,4,Mr Billings,"There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number... [looks on his paper] 4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin. [The woman employee cuts the ribbon to allow chilren to the hunt. They excitedly run all over the place looking for eggs. Some of them attack and fight each other.]"
841,16,4,Eric Cartman,"[offscreen] I'm alive! [everyone stops. Cartman runs in, gasping for air.] I'm alive, you guys. [holds a blond girl though her shoulders] I don't know how, but I'm alive! [lets go and keeps running] Can you believe it? It's a miracle. [runs to the stage] Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ."
842,16,4,Butters Stotch,"[angrily] Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! [the crowd agrees, then resumes their hunting]"
843,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey guys, listen! [nobody cares. He finds Kyle standing there, approaches him, and lets out a deep sigh.] I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe."
844,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
845,16,4,Eric Cartman,I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
846,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[puts his arm around him] I know, you're not."
847,16,4,Eric Cartman,"Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!"
848,16,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[flatly] Happy Passover, Cartman. [the camera moves up to the sun, which now has a Star of David at the center of it.]"
849,16,5,Eric Cartman,"Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay? [the boys ignore him and continue eating] See? You can't remember."
850,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"[walks in with a black right eye] Heh, h-hey fellas. [takes the remaining spot. Stan, Kenny, and Craig look at each other.]"
851,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Where's your lunch, Butters?"
852,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"OH. [looks around nervously] Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways."
853,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?"
854,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,...Yeah. [looks down at the table]
855,16,5,Stan Marsh,That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
856,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale."
857,16,5,Stan Marsh,Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
858,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy."
859,16,5,Craig Tucker,So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
860,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin."
861,16,5,Eric Cartman,He has a point.
862,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters."
863,16,5,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass."
864,16,5,Stan Marsh,I can't believe what I'm hearing! [three girls walking by hear this and stop] This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
865,16,5,Red,"Good for you, Stan, nice somebody in this school has some balls."
866,16,5,Eric Cartman,I have balls.
867,16,5,Red,"Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls."
868,16,5,Eric Cartman,Still balls.
869,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?"
870,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,My Grandma?
871,16,5,Grammy,"Well, so then your cousin Albert, Linda, actually has two girls now. One is three and the other's about little Butters' age, I think."
872,16,5,Stephen Stotch,"Well, speak of the devil."
873,16,5,Linda Stotch,"Butters, what happened to your eye?"
874,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?"
875,16,5,Grammy,"Well sure, you come and sit right here next to Grammy."
876,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
877,16,5,Stephen Stotch,"Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea."
878,16,5,Grammy,"Oh some tea would be lovely. [Stephen and Linda leave. Instantly Grammy's sweet demeanor vanishes. She raises her left fist and punches Butters on his bruised right eye. Now we know who the bully is.] What's up? [punches him again] Huh? You think you're [punch] tough, huh?"
879,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"I just... [holds his hands up in self-defense] don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma."
880,16,5,Grammy,"Think you're fuckin' tough, huh? [punches him again] You don't look fuckin' tough."
881,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma."
882,16,5,Grammy,"No, you're a little faggot! [grabs him by the collar] You got any more money? Huh?"
883,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"No, you took it all!"
884,16,5,Grammy,"[holds her fist up at him] Why don't you do something about it?! [punches him again] Do somethin', you little bitch! You're Grandma's bitch!"
885,16,5,Linda Stotch,Here we go. [brings in the tea and sets it on the coffee table. Stephen brings in some lemon bars and does the same]
886,16,5,Grammy,"[once again, sweet and kind] Oh, there's the tea. Tea for me. How lucky."
887,16,5,Linda Stotch,And your favorite lemon bars.
888,16,5,Grammy,"Goodness, what a treat this is."
889,16,5,BB Founder,"Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers ™ are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying?"
890,16,5,Mr Mackey,"Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay?"
891,16,5,BB Founder,"Aha, well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse."
892,16,5,Mr Mackey,Uh who said?
893,16,5,BB Founder,He didn't want that disclosed.
894,16,5,Mr Mackey,"Oh, he's a little Anonymous Andy?"
895,16,5,BB Founder,We would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon.
896,16,5,Mr Mackey,"Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking."
897,16,5,BB Founder,You believe positive thinking is really what's critical in schools right now? What's wrong with you?!
898,16,5,Mr Mackey,Wull I mean it kind of wo-uhuh works out.
899,16,5,BB Founder,"No, shut up! What kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign?! Bullying needs to be stopped! Now! This afternoon!"
900,16,5,Mr Mackey,Wah-eh jus- will we he-?
901,16,5,BB Founder,"Wuhhh duhhh. You may only have an Internet degree, but why don't you start acting like you're a school counselor and not an uninformed backwards little dork! M'kay?! [the Bully Buckers founder leaves the office and walks towards the hall. Moments later Mr. Mackey walks out of the office crying. He walks to the mic and turns it on]"
902,16,5,Mr Mackey,[barely holding back emotion] Attention students: today we will have an... assembly... on the subject of... bullying. M'kay? [on the hallway several students stand around listening to the announcement] The assembly is mandatory. M'kay? You'd better show up. 'Kay?
903,16,5,Red,Butters? Your grandma's looking for you.
904,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,[quickly slams his locker door shut] My grandma??
905,16,5,Red,She said to meet her outside behind the school.
906,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Oh hamburgers! [runs off to the closest restroom, runs in and closes the door]"
907,16,5,Grammy,[sitting back against the sinks] Hey twerp! [Butters notices her] You went and narc'd on me!
908,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,[startled at first] HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
909,16,5,Grammy,"[walks to the bathroom door with a menacing swagger, locks it, then walks back] I heard somebody brought in an anti-bully counselor! Thought I wouldn't find out, you little narc?!"
910,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me."
911,16,5,Grammy,"[walks towards the urinal] Oh look, what's this over here? [picks up the urinal cake] Ohoh, it's a narc puck. This is what narcs have to put in their mouths. Awww, it's got piss all over it. [picks Butters up by the collar and attempts to put the cake into his mouth]"
912,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! [he holds her off]"
913,16,5,Grammy,Put it in your mouth! Put it in your fuckin' mouth! [someone begins to pull on the bathroom door. Grammy releases Butters and opens the door. Mr. Adler is standing outside] Ohhh hellow.
914,16,5,Mr Adler,"Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked."
915,16,5,Grammy,"I'm sorry, Uh I needed the restroom and my grandson brought me to this one. Isn't that right, Butters?"
916,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,[looks at the floor] Yes...
917,16,5,Mr Adler,"Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am."
918,16,5,Grammy,"Oh thank you so much. [walks out after Mr. Adler, but just as Butters is about to close the door she spins around and confronts him once more] You narc again and you're fuckin' dead! Fuckin' dead, you got it?!"
919,16,5,Mr Adler,This way.
920,16,5,Grammy,"Oop, uh coming. [closes the door, leaving Butters to his thoughts.]"
921,16,5,BB Founder,"What makes a bully? [stands next to an image of his company's logo: Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™] The truth is there are more bullies at your school than you even think. And the student who lets bullying happen is just as bad as the bully himself. Come on out, Lorraine. [Lorraine comes out. Her hair is disheveled and her pants go up way too high.] I asked your school mate Lorraine here to help me out. [genuflects] Are you bullied in the school, Lorraine?"
922,16,5,Lorraine,...d'Yes.
923,16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Kids pick on you, call you names?"
924,16,5,Lorraine,...Sometimes.
925,16,5,Bucky Bailey,What kind of things do they say to you?
926,16,5,Lorraine,...Ugly ...neh-nerd.
927,16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Do they say ""Nice pants. Why do you wear them up to your tits?""?"
928,16,5,Lorraine,[long pause] No...
929,16,5,Bucky Bailey,"[stands up] Bullying affects everyone. And only if the entire school is united against it can bullying ever be stopped. [to Lorraine] Go, go, get out of here. [she leaves] Now what we at Bucky Bailey's Bully Busters ™ like to do is get the schools to make an anti-bullying video. So who would like to be the young student director in charge of our video? [long pause. No one volunteers] We just need one student to be the leader of our anti-bullying campaign. [still no takers] What? Are you all chicken? [begins to act like a chicken] Nobody wants to be in charge of the anti-bullying video? [acts like a chicken, then like a crying baby rubbing his eyes, then back to acting like a chicken.]"
930,16,5,Stan Marsh,I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
931,16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?!"
932,16,5,Stan Marsh,"No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped."
933,16,5,Red,"Good for you, Stan. [kids begin to clap for him. Kyle has a suspicious look.]"
934,16,5,Riley,He's cool.
935,16,5,Clyde Donovan,You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
936,16,5,Jimmy Valmer,Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! [Stan comes in from screen right]
937,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, [takes Clyde and Red and turns them around] over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying? [guides them back into the school] At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!"
938,16,5,The Kids of South Park Elementary,"[Stan leads the song. He backs up into the lobby and then into the cafeteria]

Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame.
Bullying is ugly and has a stupid name.
For a healthy world, bullying's unfit.
And I think I know what we should do to i-it.
Do do do do do to i-it.

[Clyde takes over and backs up to the gym doors]
Let's all get together and make bullying kill itself.
Bullying's an ugly thing
[Wendy takes over in the gym and backs up though two rows of kids tossing basketballs at eat other]
Lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself.
[Token takes over and backs up to some stairs, where the Goth kids are sitting]
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh."
939,16,5,Eric Cartman,"[tarted up, takes over and backs up the stairs]

Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay."
940,16,5,The Kids of South Park Elementary,"[Stan takes over at the landing between floors and backs up down the hallway and into the library]

We can make it stop. We can stomp it out.
We can beat its ass until it starts to cry.
Let's gang up on it and tell it it smells
And beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls.
If if if it ever te-lls.

[Craig takes over in the library, walks forward, and backs up down the hallway through two rows of cheerleaders and some balloons dropping from the ceiling]
Lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself.
It'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel
and make bullying kill itself.
[Timmy takes over and backs up towards a corner]
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh."
941,16,5,Eric Cartman,"[takes over at the corner and backs up, pointing at his own crotch]
My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
[Some doors open and a naked Butters is showcased in a steel-framed clear box, being carried out by two sixth graders. The lights go out and special effects appear - neon paint on the kids' faces and a blue glow through the doors. Butters takes over.]"
942,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind."
943,16,5,Jason,Stupid! (stupid stupid)
944,16,5,Pete Thelman,Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)
945,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,Pansy.
946,16,5,Older Girl,Dork!
947,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Can I, can I not do this, please? [the video stops and the hallway lights come on] I don't wanna do this."
948,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it."
949,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me."
950,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Butters, you're the star of the video!"
951,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"He doesn't wanna do it, dude."
952,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters? [Kyle walks off in a huff] Kyle?"
953,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Kyle? Kyle, dude, where are you going?!"
954,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops, then turns around] Why are you doing this, Stan?"
955,16,5,Stan Marsh,To stop bullying.
956,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,You're gonna stop bullying.
957,16,5,Stan Marsh,YES.
958,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,With Cartman singing about his vagina.
959,16,5,Stan Marsh,"...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Do you realize that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-"
960,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!"
961,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!"
962,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. [turns around and hurries away]
963,16,5,Stan Marsh,What the hell does that mean?
964,16,5,Grammy,"Oh heavens to Betsy, Linda. This is such a yummy yummy ham. I just love your cooking. [takes her fork under the table and jabs Butters with it. He winces in pain.]"
965,16,5,Stephen Stotch,"Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork. [Butters winces again] What's the matter, Butters?"
966,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. [Grammy jabs him again, and he winces in pain]"
967,16,5,Stephen Stotch,Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.
968,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. [the doorbell rings]"
969,16,5,Stephen Stotch,I'll get it. [rises and walks away]
970,16,5,Grammy,"[notices something] Linda, is that a new clock on the wall?"
971,16,5,Linda Stotch,"[looks at the clock] Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe. [while Linda talks, Grammy picks her boogers and smears them on Butters' mashed potatoes] I just love the cute little canary on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. [turns back to Grandma as Stephen brings Butters' friends over.]"
972,16,5,Stephen Stotch,"Your friends wanted to see you, Butters."
973,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!"
974,16,5,Grammy,"Oh, an anti-bullying video? How adorable. [jabs him harder with the fork, and he screams in pain]"
975,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!"
976,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,HAAAAA! [pounds the table fiercely to relieve the pain from Grammy's fork]
977,16,5,Stan Marsh,"I know, right?! [Stan, Cartman, and Kenny all imitate Butters' pain]"
978,16,5,Bucky Bailey,Whassup?! [walks to the bathroom door and locks it]
979,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hey."
980,16,5,Bucky Bailey,You went and made a video and sold it without lettin' me know.
981,16,5,Stan Marsh,Huh?
982,16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Doin' a video was my idea! It's the property of Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™, you got that?! [crosses his arms again]"
983,16,5,Stan Marsh,"But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-"
984,16,5,Bucky Bailey,"Oh, it's been stwessful?! [gets in his face] What's wrong with you?! Kids are getting bullied at school and with this money, Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™ can finally become the legit organization it deserves to be! You greedy, selfish, little PRICK! [Stan lowers his head in shame] Oh what? You gonna cwy?"
985,16,5,Stan Marsh,No.
986,16,5,Bucky Bailey,"No, go ahead, cwy. Let me see ya. [rubs his eyes as if he's the one crying] Let me see you cwy. [Stan begins to cry]"
987,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"[having a conversation with himself] We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself! [switch] Oh, but violence is never the answer. [switch] But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is! [switch] You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice! [goes into his closet and pulls out a box] Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself! [unpacks his Professor Chaos costume and puts it on] It's time you met... Chaos! [he bursts into the hallway] I've been pushed around for the last time! [runs to the guest bedroom, where Grammy is staying] Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! [bursts into Grammy's room, but is suddenly surprised at what he sees - Grammy in a supervillain outfit]"
988,16,5,Grammy,"Oh, look, it's Captain Pussy! [Professor Chaos is frozen in place] You can't stop me, Captain Pussy! Don't even try!"
989,16,5,Professor Chaos,Grandma? but how di-
990,16,5,Grammy,"I got inspired when I came across your gay little costume in your closet. [changes mood] Now come on, Captain Pussy! Time for you to get your Gummi bears!"
991,16,5,Professor Chaos,"No! Grandma please, nnnot Gummi bears!"
992,16,5,Grammy,Come 'ere! [rushes towards him]
993,16,5,Professor Chaos,Ahh! Grandma! [backs into a corner next to a small table. Grammy knocks the table over and pins Chaos against the wall]
994,16,5,Grammy,Stand up for yourself! Fight back! Be a fucking man!
995,16,5,Professor Chaos,I can't.
996,16,5,Grammy,Then it looks like you get... Gummi bears! [reaches into her mouth and pulls out her dentures] Gummy bears! [begins to gnaw at his left arm with her gums]
997,16,5,Professor Chaos,Awww! Eewww!
998,16,5,Nick Jabs,"[waiting with arms crossed] What's up? I'm Nick Jabs, president of the movie company that bought the bully video. [goes to lock the door]"
999,16,5,Bucky Bailey,Oh what? Stan Marsh got you to come talk to me?! That little cliché conflict resolution Kevin!
1000,16,5,Nick Jabs,"[advancing, making Bailey back up] The video was conceived, written, and directed by the South Park student body, you got that?!"
1001,16,5,Bucky Bailey,It was my idea. I told the students to make the video and I-and I produced the entire thing! I deserve to have my name on it!
1002,16,5,Nick Jabs,"Yeah, only problem is America doesn't give a SHIT about an old fart with a Captain Kangaroo haircut! They wanna believe kids did something on their own. [hands him a sealed envelope] Here's a cease and desist letter from our lawyers. If you ever claim any authorship of the video again, we will sue you for everything you have!"
1003,16,5,Bucky Bailey,But... but this was gonna be the thing that finally made Bully Buckers ™ a national organization.
1004,16,5,Nick Jabs,"Oh, you gonna cwy?! Oh don't cwy, you'll wook bad wif your wittle Captain Kangawoo haircut! [Mr. Bailey goes to the bathroom door, unlocks it, and walks out sobbing]"
1005,16,5,Eric Cartman,"'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. [nearby, Craig and Clyde take notice]"
1006,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!"
1007,16,5,Eric Cartman,"We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! [blows a raspberry at him]"
1008,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere! [walks away] And don't tape that to my locker! [walks into the boys' room and sees Stan waiting by the sink with arms crossed] Oh God. [Stan goes to lock the door]
1009,16,5,Stan Marsh,"What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?"
1010,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
1011,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Butters is totally fine with it, dude."
1012,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him, and neither do you!"
1013,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!"
1014,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
1015,16,5,Stan Marsh,Oh yeah.
1016,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them."
1017,16,5,Stan Marsh,"This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!"
1018,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?! [long pause] Well?!"
1019,16,5,Stan Marsh,"...What, what was the question again?"
1020,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[slowly] If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet, for free?!"
1021,16,5,Stan Marsh,"...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!"
1022,16,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around and walks out] Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! [closes the door.]"
1023,16,5,Stan Marsh,[left wondering] Why does he keep saying that?
1024,16,5,Dr Oz,"We all know that bullying has become an epidemic. Like AIDS, bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises. But now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself. [Switch to Camera 2, which shows Stan and Butters seated next to Dr. Oz. Butters is not too happy to be there, so he rests his head on his right hand] I'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film. Stan, congratulations on all your success."
1025,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. [the audience applauds]"
1026,16,5,Dr Oz,And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there?
1027,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Oh uh, nothin'."
1028,16,5,Dr Oz,"Come on, this is for everyone who's been a victim. What do you wanna say to bullies all across America? Go ahead. [Butters raises his head] Right now. Say it."
1029,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
1030,16,5,Dr Oz,"Do you hear that, bullies? Stop making kids say things on your TV shows! [the audience applauds] What else do you wanna say, Butters?"
1031,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"[feeling cornered] Please, leave me alone."
1032,16,5,Dr Oz,"Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters?"
1033,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,No it doesn't.
1034,16,5,Dr Oz,Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?!
1035,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,Stop it!
1036,16,5,Dr Oz,"Come on, this is for America! [Stan begins to get concerned. Butters looks to Stan for some reassurance] Do you realize that in America, ohohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to go to school because of bullying?! [Butters' anger begins to rise] Don't you care?! You better care! [Butters loses it and attacks Dr. Oz. The audience cheers him on. Dr. Oz collapses to the floor and Butters begins to punch him in the face]"
1037,16,5,Mr Jabs,What the hell were you thinking?! Everyone just saw that the bully victim in your movie is actually a violent psychopath!
1038,16,5,Stan Marsh,I didn't know.
1039,16,5,Mr Jabs,"This could kill our box office. People are gonna come after us now, saying we didn't check our facts!"
1040,16,5,Stan Marsh,I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
1041,16,5,Mr Jabs,"It's your fuckin' movie! Now I'm gonna have to work overtime with marketing to make sure people still sympathize with our victim! Jesus, just get the fuck out of here! I've gotta go to the bathroom! [goes to the bathroom as Stan leaves. Inside the bathroom he runs into Jesus with his arms crossed] Uh oh."
1042,16,5,Jesus Christ,"My child, [goes to lock the door] have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad."
1043,16,5,Mr Jabs,Uh... [lowers his head]
1044,16,5,Jesus Christ,"Oh, what are you gonna do? cwy now?"
1045,16,5,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Grandma? I did it, Grandma. [she opens her eyes] I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnot outta Dr. Oz. [she frowns] I can't lie, it felt kind of good. [she smiles] At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time. [her smile fades] Poor old Grandma. You know, I-I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die. [the anger leaves Grammy's face] Someday pretty soon. [he approaches Grammy] And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you. [walks back to the door] 'Night Grandma. [exits and closes the door]"
1046,16,5,Stan Marsh,"Huh? Aw, come on! [comes across Clyde, Craig, and Cartman and stops] Dude, what's going on?"
1047,16,5,Clyde Donovan,"You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bull-crap bullying video!"
1048,16,5,Stan Marsh,Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
1049,16,5,Eric Cartman,The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
1050,16,5,Red,You made us look like uncaring idiots!
1051,16,5,Craig Tucker,Yeah. Boooo!
1052,16,5,Stan Marsh,How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
1053,16,5,Timmy Burch,[rolls up] Boooo!
1054,16,5,Stan Marsh,[moves off a bit] Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
1055,16,5,Mr Mackey,"Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!"
1056,16,5,Stan Marsh,"[sighs in resignation] I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do."
1057,16,5,Singer background singers,"Baaam badam baaam baaadam. Baaam badam bam

1075,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous."
1076,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
1077,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes."
1078,16,6,Kenny McCormick,[offended] (What?!)

1080,16,6,Kenny McCormick,"[throws the twig away] (This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)"
1081,16,6,Eric Cartman,"No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes."
1082,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?"
1083,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining."

1085,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,We've definitely not done that before!
1086,16,6,Stan Marsh,I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.

1098,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."""
1099,16,6,Clerk,"[he's got the boys dressed up] All right, you guys look ready to zipline!"
1100,16,6,Eric Cartman,Alright!
1101,16,6,Clerk,"Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others."

1104,16,6,Man 1,Hello.
1105,16,6,Woman 2,Hi
1106,16,6,Narrator,"The boys have just made a sobering discovery. [a shot of Stan's internal organs and spine] For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down. [this is shown] The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family. [Stan's brain and skull are shown] But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour."
1107,16,6,Woman 2,"[quite pregnant] Hey, how are you?"
1108,16,6,Stan Marsh,[mimicking] Good. How are you?
1109,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. [the couple arrives]"
1110,16,6,Clerk,"Alright, our last zipliners are here. [Kyle and Cartman are visibly angry]"
1111,16,6,Man 2,"Sorry we made you wait, everybody. [A shot of Kyle's mouth interior is shown]"

1113,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,We don't mind.
1114,16,6,Eric Cartman,"[being interviewed] Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. [the benches are rearranged so the zipliners can watch a TV screen above them]"
1115,16,6,Clerk,Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
1116,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"[who's just the clerk, naturally] Hey there Michael. [Everyone behind the boys laughs.]"
1117,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. [return to the tour]"
1118,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael."
1119,16,6,Michael (Clerk),Thanks Michael. [turns off the TV] Anybody have any questions?
1120,16,6,Eric Cartman,...No.
1121,16,6,Man 2,I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? [the boys are stunned that this needs to be done]
1122,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] ""Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"""
1123,16,6,Michael (Clerk),Let's get out there and get zippin'! [everyone rises and heads out of the waiting room]
1124,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ!
1125,16,6,Eric Cartman,Finally!
1126,16,6,Narrator,"The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse."

1128,16,6,Guide 1,"[a woman, waiting by a van that has been out earlier in the day] Everyone just step on in the shuttle. [opens the van's sliding door. The zipliners head for it]"
1129,16,6,Stan Marsh,...Shuttle?
1130,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?"
1131,16,6,Michael (Clerk),It's about forty-five minutes.
1132,16,6,Narrator,"It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear. [a look at Kyle's brain] His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word ""shuttle"" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons [this is shown] that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. [two images of overloaded shuttle buses appear, then footage of the Space Shuttle Challenger going up and exploding, and Kyle is scared]"
1133,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, come on, we don't have a choice. [leads the others to the shuttle van.]"
1134,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?"
1135,16,6,Stan Marsh,Uh that's okay.
1136,16,6,Man 3,"Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought- [Cartman begins to mutter angrily]"
1137,16,6,Narrator,"[hour 2] It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle."
1138,16,6,Michael (Clerk),We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!
1139,16,6,Adults,Wooo!
1140,16,6,Narrator,"But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing. [Cartman is drinking some Mountain Dew from a can. The camera looks around the van] Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen. [the camera goes down Eric's esophagus] Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months. [the camera comes back up the esophagus and out Cartman's mouth] And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back down Cartman's throat] The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas. [a quick journey through the intestines is shown] When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter. [the sphincter is shown] Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage. [this is shown, along with Kyle's reaction]"
1141,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, did you fart?!"
1142,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Mmmm, no?"
1143,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright buys, we're here! [The van pulls up to the first entrace to Zipline Adventures. Both Stan and Kenny look sleepy]"
1144,16,6,Stan Marsh,Thank God. [everyone is out of the van as Guide 1 goes up to the launch pad two stories up. The pad is attached to a pine tree]
1145,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?"
1146,16,6,Eric Cartman,The trees' biology?
1147,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes."
1148,16,6,Stan Marsh,I think we're good.
1149,16,6,Man 2,[raises his left hand] I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.
1150,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-"
1151,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! [Cartman is hooked up]"
1152,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work. [a shot of the tour group] Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out ""Shockabra!"", look up and give the camera a nice ""shockabra"" [two fists with thumbs and pinkies extended]. Alright, you ready?"
1153,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. [Michael shortens the strap between Cartman and the zipline, and holds him up]"
1154,16,6,Michael (Clerk),Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?
1155,16,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
1156,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright, let's hear you say ""Zipliiine!"""
1157,16,6,Eric Cartman,Zipliiine. [Michael sends him on his way]
1158,16,6,Michael (Clerk),[voice-over] Shockabra! [Cartman holds out his fists as indicated above and the camera takes his picture]
1159,16,6,Guide 1,"Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!"
1160,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Well? How was it, Cartman?"
1161,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!"
1162,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[as Kyle is prepped] Oh, really??"
1163,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!"
1164,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright Kyle, give me a ""Zipliiine!"""
1165,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Zipline. [Michael sends him on his way]
1166,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Shockabra! [does the fists. Kyle does the fists too and the camera takes his picture, but he's mad]"
1167,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster."
1168,16,6,Narrator,"After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens."
1169,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! [the others cheer, but the boys are worried.]"
1170,16,6,Eric Cartman,"[being interviewed] ""The next zipline? What are you talking about?"""
1171,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?"
1172,16,6,Michael (Clerk),This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.
1173,16,6,Stan Marsh,[being interviewed] And it was like WHAM. [makes a fist with his right hand and punches his left handn with it.]
1174,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,STOP!
1175,16,6,Eric Cartman,NOOOO!
1176,16,6,Guide,Everyone back in the shuttle!
1177,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,NOOOO! [the adults and a fifth kid get back into the van]
1178,16,6,Eric Cartman,NOOOO! [the adults and a fifth kid get back into the van]
1179,16,6,Narrator,"The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. [the boys scream and some scens of the next ziplines flash by: Michael sends someone down the zipline, he plays guitar during a break ""led me through that""]"
1180,16,6,Guide,Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?
1181,16,6,Man 2,Yes.
1182,16,6,Boys,"AAAA! [shots of Kyle, Kenny, and Stan]"
1183,16,6,Adults,"""Ack"" went the little frog one day. ""Ack"" went the little green frog..."
1184,16,6,Eric Cartman,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [opening shots return]
1185,16,6,Michael (Clerk),Let 'er rip! [sends Man 2 on his way]
1186,16,6,Man 4,Zipliiine!
1187,16,6,Narrator,Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
1188,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator."
1189,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Wugh!
1190,16,6,Narrator,Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.
1191,16,6,Pete Nickals,"But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- [Woman 1 is shown going down, then man 1, then]"
1192,16,6,Man 2,[with his wife] Could you get another picture of us? [hands Kyle the camera]
1193,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [a shot of the whole group is shown]
1194,16,6,Narrator,The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
1195,16,6,Eric Cartman,[on his way down a zipline.] I'm so fucking bored! [Hour 3 arrives. Michael sends the next zipliner on down. The others cheer her on]
1196,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Alright, you going next, Ricky? [hooks Ricky up and sends him down]"
1197,16,6,The Boys,[on the ground] Help! Somebody! Help us! [the adults on the launch pad cheer the next zipliner down]
1198,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
1199,16,6,Stan Marsh,There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
1200,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,[grabs Stan's arms] Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! [another zipliner goes down]
1201,16,6,Zipliner,Zipline!
1202,16,6,Adults,Woohoo!
1203,16,6,Eric Cartman,"We should have never listened to you, Kyle."
1204,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Me?!
1205,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"""
1206,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!"
1207,16,6,Eric Cartman,I brought it up because you already brought it up!
1208,16,6,Stan Marsh,[being interviewed] That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
1209,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,You fat piece of shit!
1210,16,6,Eric Cartman,Fuck you Kyle!
1211,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!"
1212,16,6,Eric Cartman,Yes!
1213,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes!
1214,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?"
1215,16,6,Narrator,"But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea. [the camera goes down Cartman's throat.] Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea. [the camera goes back up his throat and out his mouth] But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back in] His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste. [a quick trip through Cartman's intestines, as before] The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear. [this is shown, and the smell wafts up into Kyle's nose] Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb."
1216,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
1217,16,6,Eric Cartman,Nnnn-mo...
1218,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible."
1219,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch."
1220,16,6,Guide,"[standing in a covered lunch area] Come in by the waterfall, gang! [it's a small waterfall]"
1221,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?"
1222,16,6,Man 2,Skip a free lunch? Not me! [runs to the lunch area. The other zipliners follow]
1223,16,6,Guide,Wo wants sandwiches? [pulls out sealed sandwiches from a portable ice box] We got ...turkey. [Man 2 takes that one] Ham. [another zipliner takes that one] Turkey ham. [another zipliner takes that one...]
1224,16,6,Pete Nickals,"[in the background] Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. [in the foreground the boys are sitting on their own log with the word HELP on the ground before them made with twigs and branches]"
1225,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! [keeps sipping the Double Dew]"
1226,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!"
1227,16,6,Eric Cartman,"This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew. [at the bottom of the can is a blurb saying ""DEW THE MATH!""] Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast."
1228,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
1229,16,6,Eric Cartman,"If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!"
1230,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[runs up to the tour guides] Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick."
1231,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?"
1232,16,6,Stan Marsh,...Yyyeah.
1233,16,6,Guide,"That's not herpes, it's a cold sore."
1234,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Right, sorry."
1235,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go."
1236,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down."
1237,16,6,Some adults,Zipline! Wooo!
1238,16,6,Guide,What about the stables?
1239,16,6,Michael (Clerk),"Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back."
1240,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true."
1241,16,6,Rancher,"Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?"
1242,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Yea, please!"
1243,16,6,Rancher,Well I think we can set ya up.
1244,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, thank God!"
1245,16,6,Stan Marsh,You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
1246,16,6,Rancher,"Step right out here, we'll get you going. [leads the boys out to a horseback riding tour] Got four more for you, Duncan. [All the riders wave and say hello, and a few take pictures]"
1247,16,6,Eric Cartman,NOOO! [opening shots return]
1248,16,6,Narrator,Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
1249,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"AAAAH! [the boys are now shown on horseback in this order: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny]"
1250,16,6,Eric Cartman,[still aching] Eeeeugh.
1251,16,6,Narrator,Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. [the camera tries some dramatic moves]
1252,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Can we please go faster?!
1253,16,6,Kenny McCormick,(I can't take it!)
1254,16,6,Duncan,We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.
1255,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAAAAAAH!
1256,16,6,Eric Cartman,Uh oh. [lets out a wet fart]
1257,16,6,Rider 1,"[to Kyle] So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning."
1258,16,6,Narrator,"An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining"""
1259,16,6,Duncan,This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls. Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?
1260,16,6,Rider 2,"Well I certainly would! [Other riders do too. Nearby, Kyle has collapsed]"
1261,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!"
1262,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Just go. Go without me.
1263,16,6,Stan Marsh,"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!"
1264,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't take it anymore. [his voice gets weaker] Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan."
1265,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought ""I can find us a way out!"" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it."
1266,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[returns from his search quite excited] You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!"
1267,16,6,Eric Cartman,A marina?
1268,16,6,Stan Marsh,"We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!"
1269,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,What's the point?
1270,16,6,Stan Marsh,Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! [an announcer says the following lines]
1271,16,6,Narrator,Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [shots of the boys screaming on various parts of the boat] Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat [named Puffin] which is only allowed to go five miles an hour. [some footage is dropped to speed up the boat in time-lapse form]
1272,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
1273,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!"
1274,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!"
1275,16,6,Narrator,The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
1276,16,6,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?"
1277,16,6,Kenny McCormick,[slurring his speech] I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
1278,16,6,Narrator,"For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat"" [more shots of the boys on the Puffin]"
1279,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no. [Cartman lowers a 20-oz. bottle of Mountain Dew] You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
1280,16,6,Kenny McCormick,Beavers! [a beaver is swimming in the water]
1281,16,6,Narrator,"After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining."
1282,16,6,Stan Marsh,[being interviewed] The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
1283,16,6,Eric Cartman,WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
1284,16,6,Narrator,"If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die. [Stan looks ready to sleep. Cartman takes a swig of Mountain Dew]"
1285,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Here! [takes Cartman's bottle] Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
1286,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it."
1287,16,6,Eric Cartman,I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
1288,16,6,Kenny McCormick,"Hey. [tugs on Cartman, who turns to look at him] Fuck you, Cartman."
1289,16,6,Narrator,Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [individual shots of the boys. They all have oral herpes now] And just when it seems it can't get any worse... [the boys are nodding off again]
1290,16,6,Stan Marsh,"...Kenny? Kenny! [Kenny has slid down on the seat, but his eyes are open]"
1291,16,6,Narrator,Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
1292,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!"
1293,16,6,Eric Cartman,"No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!"
1294,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!"
1295,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed] And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said ""Stop it!"""
1296,16,6,Stan Marsh,[rises and walks a bit] Stop it! It was me! My idea.
1297,16,6,Eric Cartman,You?!
1298,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out the brochure for Backcountry Adventures, then looks at it for a few seconds] I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. [Kyle and Cartman look at each other]"
1299,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!"
1300,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[turns to face them] If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. [the camera pans down and sure enough, the offer is on the brochure cover: Sign up 3 friends and get an iPod NANO!!!]"
1301,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
1302,16,6,Stan Marsh,I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
1303,16,6,Eric Cartman,[points at Stan] You... You killed Kenny! [Stan begins to weep]
1304,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! [a shot of Kenny, then a shot of the three surviving boys crying. Kyle cries on Cartman's shoulder and Cartman comforts him]"
1305,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[being interviewed] How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one."
1306,16,6,Stan Marsh,"[being interviewed, crying] The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back. [wipes away the flowing tears] I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere."
1307,16,6,Narrator,"But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. [the boys look around, startled]"
1308,16,6,Eric Cartman,[being interviewed] It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
1309,16,6,Eric Cartman,You came for us!
1310,16,6,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey!
1311,16,6,Stan Marsh,"Thank you. [whispers] Mr. Hankey. [Mr. Hankey has landed on the boat, at the top of an armrest]"
1312,16,6,Mr Hankey,"[without the falsetto voice] Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. [the boys are overjoyed at their good fortune]"
1313,16,6,Eric Cartman,[being interviewed] We were saved. It was over.
1314,16,6,Narrator,"After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter. [shown, the images are back to the cartoon form] In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven. [a jet plane made of poo] From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express. [The ziplining Shockabra pictures are shown] Four friends, turn apart by tragedy [Kenny's image vanishes, leaving the forest background in place], would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents. [Mr. Hankey delivers them personally. The parents are distraught] And the boys received treatment for their herpes. [two paramedics treat Stan and Cartman as Mr. Hankey looks on from above. Stan and Cartman focus on Mr. Hankey.]"
1315,16,6,Eric Cartman,"[being interviewed] No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore."
1316,16,6,Narrator,"[shots of the scenes being described are shown] Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining. [a lecture tour. Stan is shown on stage with a ""No on Ziplining"" logo] His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman, [shown as a mountaineer] he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math."
1317,16,6,Eric Cartman,"[being interviewed] It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. [takes a long sip]"
1318,16,7,Butters Stotch,"[runs across the hallway] Fellas! Fellas! Fellas! [spots them in another hallway and runs to them] AAAAH, fellas!"
1319,16,7,Stan Marsh,What? [most of the fourth grade boys gather around]
1320,16,7,Butters Stotch,"[stops and catches his breath, then jabs his right index finger at the floor] Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!"
1321,16,7,Eric Cartman,What?
1322,16,7,Butters Stotch,[jabs his finger again] Guess!
1323,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Just tell us, Butters."
1324,16,7,Butters Stotch,There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
1325,16,7,Craig Tucker,"Oh, we have a new cheerleader?"
1326,16,7,Clyde Donovan,What's she look like?
1327,16,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, what's her name?)"
1328,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[taking control of the situation] Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most."
1329,16,7,Butters Stotch,"Look, look, there she is. [near the bleachers opposite the doors are five girls: Red, Wendy, Bebe, Lola, and Jenny. Between Wendy and Bebe are two pompoms waiting for a sixth cheerleader, who arrives shortly. It's a black girl. The other five girls begin talking to her all at once]"
1330,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked? [Token looks over at him. The girls start practicing] Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you."
1331,16,7,Token Black,[anger flashes across his face] Why?! Why are you happy for me?!
1332,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?"
1333,16,7,Token Black,Nothing! [walks away]
1334,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[confused] What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable."
1335,16,7,Mr Garrison,"And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon [circles BARATHEON on the board], and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? So where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- [during the lecture, the following takes place]"
1336,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[fairly whispering throughout, beginning when Mr. Garrison mentions Lord Stark. He sits between Token and the new girl and grins as he looks at each of them by turn] Dude... Token! [jerks his head a bit in the girl's direction and points at her] Token. Dude. [Token looks at him, then goes back to taking notes. Cartman smiles] Psst. Token. [points to the girl again, but puts his right hand up so she doesn't notice. Token is annoyed] Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there."
1337,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[annoyed as well] Will you shut the hell up?! [goes back to taking notes. Cartman finally picks up his pen, but doesn't write anything]"
1338,16,7,Eric Cartman,...Token. You want me to pass her a jelly bean?
1339,16,7,Token Black,[whispers back] No!
1340,16,7,Eric Cartman,Huh?
1341,16,7,Token Black,[louder] No!
1342,16,7,Mr Garrison,"[stops talking and turns to the class] Token, is there a problem? [Token is a loss for words, but Cartman fields this question]"
1343,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis. [begins to laugh at his own joke] Right guys? [tries to hold the laugh in]"
1344,16,7,Mr Garrison,"Everyone pay attention! [goes back to the board] Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- [while Garrison resumes his lesson, Cartman resumes his prodding]"
1345,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[quickly looks at the girl and at Token] Token. [leans back in his seat so Token has a clear view of the girl] Dude, dude. Dude."
1346,16,7,Red,"So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us."
1347,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[approaching] Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?"
1348,16,7,Bebe Stevens,[shuts her locker] Why?!
1349,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[motions to his left] Just, can I talk to you, real quick? [walks the girls over to the end of the hallway] What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?"
1350,16,7,Red,About Token? Why?
1351,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know."
1352,16,7,Bebe Stevens,Token likes Nichole?
1353,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, of course. [the girls look at each other]"
1354,16,7,Red,"Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea."
1355,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?"
1356,16,7,Bebe Stevens,Okay.
1357,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, you guys."
1358,16,7,Lola,"[moves up four steps] One two three four, sorry Bebe."
1359,16,7,Bebe Stevens,"Oh, that's okay. [the girls laugh about it] So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you."
1360,16,7,Lola,Ohhh.
1361,16,7,Jenny Simon,Ohhh.
1362,16,7,Red,Ohhh.
1363,16,7,and Wendy,Ohhh.
1364,16,7,Nichole,"Oh my gosh, who?"
1365,16,7,Red,That boy Token.
1366,16,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. [the other girls chime in, showing their support. The camera pulls back a bit, and Cartman is shown eavesdropping just outside a basement window]"
1367,16,7,Nichole,"Oh jeez, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute."
1368,16,7,Bebe Stevens,[excited] Who? Whowhowhowho?
1369,16,7,Nichole,"That kid, with the orange coat and the green hat?"
1370,16,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh, you mean Kyle?"
1371,16,7,Nichole,Yeah.
1372,16,7,The Girls,"Ooooh, Kyle."
1373,16,7,Eric Cartman,WHAT?! KYLE?! [the girls don't hear him]
1374,16,7,Bebe Stevens,Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
1375,16,7,The Girls,K-I-S-S-O-M-G!
1376,16,7,Nichole,"Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. [the girls laugh while Cartman gets livid]"
1377,16,7,Eric Cartman,Motherfucker! [gets up and runs off]
1378,16,7,The Girls,"We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows! [Cartman approaches Nichole]"
1379,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, ah, Nichole, right?"
1380,16,7,Nichole,Yeah. [Wendy stops practicing]
1381,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here? [takes her to another set of bleachers nearby] Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?"
1382,16,7,Nichole,"[taken aback] Oh no, who told you that?"
1383,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know. [fakes a sweat] Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together?"
1384,16,7,Nichole,Ohhh.
1385,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had."
1386,16,7,Nichole,"Wow, I-I'm sorry. I totally respect that. [puts her right hand on his left shoulder] Hey, thanks a lot for telling me."
1387,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out."
1388,16,7,Nichole,"[withdraws her hand] Oh, I'm sorry."
1389,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. [snaps his fingers and walks away]"
1390,16,7,Nichole,"Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here."
1391,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, thanks. [smiles. Nichole turns and walks away, smiling. Kyle sees Craig and Timmy nearby and runs towards them] Dude, that new girl's into me!"
1392,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Psst Butters. Butters! [Butters stops and notices, then walks over to Cartman] At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room."
1393,16,7,Butters Stotch,How come?
1394,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[takes off his shades] Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married."
1395,16,7,Butters Stotch,"Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other."
1396,16,7,Eric Cartman,"No no. [walks him towards the camera] Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push."
1397,16,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. [hands her the towels]"
1398,16,7,Nichole,"Oh, he does? [Butters nods] Okay."
1399,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! [the boys make a break for the front of the school and exit the front doors]"
1400,16,7,Craig Tucker,Where?
1401,16,7,Jimmy Valmer,I-I don't see a b-b-Bat-Mobile.
1402,16,7,Nichole,"[keeps walking, unaware of what Cartman just did] Hello??"
1403,16,7,Token Black,[walks in dressed in a towel and drying his face with another] AAA!
1404,16,7,Nichole,OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!
1405,16,7,Token Black,Where is everybody? What's goin' on??
1406,16,7,Nichole,"Coach wanted me to... [winces] I'm sorry. [drops the towels, turns and goes back to the doors. She tries to open them but can't]"
1407,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey guys. Guys! Hold up. [runs up to the girls, who stop and turn to face him] Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?"
1408,16,7,Jenny Simon,Yeah?
1409,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
1410,16,7,Lola,"She likes... movies, cats."
1411,16,7,Jenny Simon,[to Lola] She likes basketball.
1412,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!"
1413,16,7,Lola,"Well- Hey Kyle, [he stops and returns] we were gonna head over to the mall. You wanna go with us?"
1414,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! [runs off]"
1415,16,7,Jenny Simon,Guess he has a crush on Nichole.
1416,16,7,Lola,[looks away for a moment] I don't think so. I heard Kyle swings for the same team.
1417,16,7,Jenny Simon,Really?!
1418,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[back with Craig and Timmy] It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game. [looks back at the girls, who look at him, then giggle as he turns back to the boys] Man, I-I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. [looks back at the girls and waves. They grin and wave back]"
1419,16,7,Token Black,Hey! In here! [punches the door]
1420,16,7,Nichole,You think the janitors are still here?
1421,16,7,Token Black,"Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. [takes her around the locker room. Nichole notices a table with food and some other things on it]"
1422,16,7,Nichole,Look! [walks to the table] Somebody left a deli platter. [Token joins her] And board games. And massage oil.
1423,16,7,Token Black,Oh... Good.
1424,16,7,Nichole,Well that was sure an interesting night.
1425,16,7,Token Black,It sure was.
1426,16,7,Nichole,"Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been really scary."
1427,16,7,Token Black,"Yeah. Now that it's over, I... I guess it was kind of fun. [smiles]"
1428,16,7,Nichole,"Yeah, it kind of was. Maybe... I-I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow."
1429,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[hiding in the bushes, weeping silently] Oh my God, sooo cute."
1430,16,7,Token Black,I'd like that.
1431,16,7,Nichole,Cool. Well... thanks again. [they hug each other]
1432,16,7,Eric Cartman,[sweetly] Ohhhhh my God.
1433,16,7,Cupid Me,"[pops out of Cartman's head] We did it, Eric. We found them each other's ray of sunshine."
1434,16,7,Eric Cartman,"You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. [tickles the little cupid]"
1435,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee. [pops back into Cartman's head, leaving behind a trail of hearts]"
1436,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know, my heart
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart

I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?"
1437,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. [behind him, on the merry-go-round, are Stan, Kenny, and Butters. Stan and Kenny are playing with a ball.]"
1438,16,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, why are you so into their relationship?"
1439,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, it's just so... perfect. [Stan and Kenny resume playing]"
1440,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You motherfucker! [runs into view and punches Cartman, who falls on his face]"
1441,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, Jesus Christ!"
1442,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
1443,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?"
1444,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!"
1445,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!"
1446,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!"
1447,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez? [points to a Hispanic couple riding play elephants] Is it a coincidence they ended up together?!"
1448,16,7,Stan Marsh,"Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago."
1449,16,7,Eric Cartman,Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that.
1450,16,7,Cupid Me,"[reappears, and Cartman smiles at him] Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?"
1451,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Shh, quiet, Cupid Me."
1452,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
1453,16,7,Eric Cartman,Nothing.
1454,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,Who is Cupid Me?!
1455,16,7,Eric Cartman,Nobody.
1456,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
1457,16,7,Eric Cartman,Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are! [can't fault him there. Nichole giggles again. Kyle looks defeated] Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
1458,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,Goddamnit! [walks away angrily]
1459,16,7,Dad,[clears his throat] Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.
1460,16,7,Nichole,His name is Token. He's really nice.
1461,16,7,Dad,Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.
1462,16,7,Nichole,So?
1463,16,7,Dad,"Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person."
1464,16,7,Mom,"Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person."
1465,16,7,William,"I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, ""Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!"""
1466,16,7,Nichole,"It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence."
1467,16,7,Mom,"And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey."
1468,16,7,William,"Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it."
1469,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Come on! [pounds on the door some more] Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry it up in there?! [pounds on the door some more. The door opens and Cupid Me floats out]"
1470,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teehee."
1471,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!"
1472,16,7,Cupid Me,[giggles] Sorry. [Cartman goes in]
1473,16,7,Eric Cartman,"That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me! [covers his nose with his bath robe] Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!"
1474,16,7,Cupid Me,Teeheeheeheeheehee.
1475,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, at least flush the toilet! [walks over to it] Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts."
1476,16,7,Cupid Me,They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
1477,16,7,Eric Cartman,"You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! [tries to catch Cupid Me, but Cupid Me keeps away]"
1478,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee. [flits here and there]"
1479,16,7,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna get you! [chases Cupid Me out of the bathroom]
1480,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee, no! [flits on down the hall]"
1481,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I almost got you! Almost! [Liane walks out of her room with clean laundry, and there's no sign of Cupid Me]"
1482,16,7,Liane Cartman,"[sees Cartman dancing around] Everything okay, sweetie?"
1483,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Everything's great, Mom. [to the invisible Cupid Me] No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! [dances away]"
1484,16,7,Nichole,Oh no...
1485,16,7,Nichole,[sad] Hey Token.
1486,16,7,Token Black,[smiles and turns around] Hey Nichole.
1487,16,7,Nichole,Can I talk to you for a sec?
1488,16,7,Token Black,Sure! [she takes him to the same drinking fountain Kyle took Jenny and Lola to earlier] What's up?
1489,16,7,Nichole,"Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out."
1490,16,7,Token Black,Oh.
1491,16,7,Nichole,"I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?"
1492,16,7,Token Black,Okay...
1493,16,7,Nichole,I think you're really great... W-w-we just...
1494,16,7,Token Black,I think... you're really great.
1495,16,7,Nichole,...I'm sorry.
1496,16,7,Token Black,Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. [turns and walks away sadly]
1497,16,7,Nichole,Okay. [she turns towards the drinking fountain]
1498,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[crying inconsolably, sometimes sneezing into a tissue] It's not fair! They were so... happy!"
1499,16,7,Butters Stotch,"[holding Cartman's right hand] It's gonna be okay, Eric."
1500,16,7,Eric Cartman,It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
1501,16,7,Butters Stotch,They'll find love somewhere else.
1502,16,7,Eric Cartman,"No, they won't!"
1503,16,7,Butters Stotch,"Yes, they will."
1504,16,7,Eric Cartman,"No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!"
1505,16,7,Cupid Me,[pops out again] Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
1506,16,7,Eric Cartman,And you! I should have never believed in you!
1507,16,7,Butters Stotch,"In... In who, Eric?"
1508,16,7,Eric Cartman,"[grabs the imaginary cupid] I never wanna see you again! [hurls it into his closet door. It flies low. Cartman gets out of bed, grabs a bat that's conveniently leaning against his bedroom door, and bashes the cupid over and over] Take! Your sunshine! And fuckin'! Die! [puts the bat up against the door and crawls back into bed. Butters takes Cartman's hand again and Cartman resumes crying]"
1509,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey man. You okay?
1510,16,7,Token Black,Yeah.
1511,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,[sits next to him] What happened? It just didn't work out?
1512,16,7,Token Black,"Yeah, I guess."
1513,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... It's done?"
1514,16,7,Token Black,[long sigh] Yeah.
1515,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[scratches his head behind the ear] So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?"
1516,16,7,Token Black,"Yeah, we're through."
1517,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?"
1518,16,7,Token Black,[getting the wrong idea] I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. [gets off the bench and walks away]
1519,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Huh? [suddenly remembers] Dude, what the fuck?"
1520,16,7,Announcer,We'll be back with more of the Jeffersons right after this.
1521,16,7,Man,"[leaves his office] I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too! [walks off. Next he's on the ground floor] I can't be constipated on the job. [stops and holds up a box] That's why I need... Soft Serve. [at a tennis court. He serves] Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough. [Cartman's interest is aroused. In the commercial the man is heading for the restroom. Another businessman comes out and the first one stops him] Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work! [now trying to poop in the toilet] 'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!"
1522,16,7,Eric Cartman,"That's right... That's right! [runs up to his room, goes into his closet and digs through his stuff until he finds the shoe box he put Cupid Me into after whacking him almost to death. He takes off the lid] Ohhh. [Cupid Me is shown laying face down battered and bruised, with a dry blood stream still near his mouth] I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you."
1523,16,7,Cupid Me,"No, you don't."
1524,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything."
1525,16,7,Cupid Me,"No, you don't. [opens its right eye for a second]"
1526,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. [tickles the cupid]"
1527,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teehee, stop it."
1528,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do."
1529,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee, teeheeheehee, [flies out of the box] teeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee."
1530,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important."
1531,16,7,William,"I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game."
1532,16,7,Eric Cartman,Denver Nuggets game?
1533,16,7,William,"Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy."
1534,16,7,Eric Cartman,[dolly zoom] NOOOOOOO! [runs away quickly]
1535,16,7,Announcer,"Welcome to today's matchup between the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Clippers. [the starting five from both teams take the court. A vendor hands Kyle two drinks, one of which he gives to Nichole. They look at each other fondly and take sips from their sodas.] And now, here to sing the National Anthem, country music star Brad Paisley. [he stands at center court and waves as a spotlight shines on him]"
1536,16,7,Brad Paisley,"O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars-"
1537,16,7,Eric Cartman,Nooooooo!
1538,16,7,Announcer,"Nuggets fans, please direct your attention to center court and the president of Halitosis Kidz. [she's shown on the MegaTron waving to the spectators behind four men who are holding a Halitosis Kidz banner], who invites you to join the Denver Nuggets in the fight against morbid halitosis in children. [POV change from MegaTron to center court] Here to attempt a three-point shot for adolescents with terminally bad breath is [two of the men leave with the banner and an obese girl steps forward] the poster child for Halitosis Kidz, Stacy Muleburg. [the two other men cover their noses with their Denver team jackets as one of them hands Stacy the ball. She rushes up and throws the ball, but it's a brick] And a good try. [the two Denver men, two cameramen, the announcer, and the HK president all gather round her]"
1539,16,7,Stacy Muleburg,Aaahahahaaaa.
1540,16,7,Adults,Awww! [they all back away as fast as they can. The spectators clap for the effort. Kyle and Nichole clap as well]
1541,16,7,Eric Cartman,[running into the center] NOOOOOOO! [triggers an alarm]
1542,16,7,Guard,Tickets please.
1543,16,7,Eric Cartman,No time! NOOOOOOO!
1544,16,7,Announcer,"We're all set for the tipoff. [The ball is thrown into the air and a Clipper tips the ball. A Nugget - Arron Afflalo - grabs it and the game begins. Afflalo throws it to JaVale McGee for an alley-oop, and McGee makes the first shot. The crowd cheers]"
1545,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Attention! Attention please! [Kyle and Nichole are surprised to hear his voice. Cartman is on the MegaTron] This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it! [Token is surprised to see Cartman there too, but Craig and Clyde are unfazed] Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands! [Nichole begins to take this in] Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. [Kyle is getting pissed off]"
1546,16,7,Crowd,Awwwww. [everyone looks at Kyle]
1547,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.

I swear by the moon and the stars and the sky
[Cartman and Kyle are paired on the MegaTron and the lovecam is activated - a heart appears over their images, Cartman on the left, Kyle on the right]
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear [Crowd: ""Awwww."" Kyle tries to push it all away] like the shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse [Brad appears: ""better or worse""], till death do us part [Brad: ""death do us part""]
I'll love you with [Cartman and Brad] every gay beat of my heart!"
1548,16,7,Brad Paisley,"I swear, Kyle."
1549,16,7,Eric Cartman,"I swear, Kyle. [the crowd erupts in applause, as do the players. Kyle leaves his seat, steaming mad]"
1550,16,7,Nichole,Where are you going?
1551,16,7,Kyle Broflovski,That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! [walks away]
1552,16,7,Nichole,He did that? Oh no.
1553,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside. [now with urgency] Seriously you guys, you gotta see it. It's the Bat-Mobile! It's outside."
1554,16,7,Spectator,"What? [leaves his seat. Soon everyone is leaving the center, including the players from both teams. Token and Nichole find themselves looking at each other just outside the bleachers]"
1555,16,7,Nichole,Token. Hey.
1556,16,7,Token Black,Hi.
1557,16,7,Nichole,"Token, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black."
1558,16,7,Token Black,I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. [they turn aside for a moment to avoid each other]
1559,16,7,Both,Do you think we could... Do you still want to... [they smile at each other]
1560,16,7,Nichole,Maybe we can give it another try?
1561,16,7,Token Black,There are still people who will look at us funny. And think we're supposed to be together.
1562,16,7,Nichole,Let them look. I don't care.
1563,16,7,Token Black,"I don't care, either. [Cartman has a camera trained on them, while he takes up the whole screen on the MegaTron, praying for this to work out]"
1564,16,7,Nichole,I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter.
1565,16,7,Token Black,YAY! [they run to each other and hug each other]
1566,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh my gohhhd, so cute! [runs out of the control room. Cupid Me appears]"
1567,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place."
1568,16,7,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together."
1569,16,7,Cupid Me,"That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you!"
1570,16,7,Eric Cartman,Really?!
1571,16,7,Cupid Me,"There she is! [points to Stacy, who turns around and growls at Cartman, showing her rotten teeth]"
1572,16,7,Eric Cartman,"What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!"
1573,16,7,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you! [gives him the finger and then goes and shoots some arrows onto Stacy's face. Stacy's pupils become hearts]"
1574,16,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, stop it!"
1575,16,7,Stacy Muleburg,Haaagh! [Cartman spins around and runs. Stacy gives chase]
1576,16,7,Eric Cartman,Nooo!
1577,16,7,Stacy Muleburg,Haahahaagh!
1578,16,8,Dan,"[describing the action on the field] Artonius Jackson catches the ball [Jackson makes his way around a group of players], he's running down the sideline- [Jackson gets tackled to the ground by #48] Ohhhh!"
1579,16,8,Randy Marsh,BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
1580,16,8,Dan,"Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up. [once he's up, he dusts himself off.]"
1581,16,8,Randy Marsh,That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
1582,16,8,"Voice-Over, Announcer, Commentator","Yeah, Jackson took a real shot and... [Jackson dusts himself off and turns around] well I'm not sure what he's doing now, but uh, it appears as if he's looking for his keys, Dan."
1583,16,8,Dan,"Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license."
1584,16,8,"Voice-Over, Announcer, Commentator","Coach Martin is coming over to tell him that now, but Jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home. [the coach tries to get his attention]"
1585,16,8,Dan,"Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?"
1586,16,8,Roger Goodell,"Well, there certainly are interesting statistics coming out, Dan, and we are deeply concerned, anduh and waiting to see if there's... really any direct correlation between football and head trauma."
1587,16,8,Dan,"Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors [fat, but the most lucid of the alumni. He stops and waves to the crowd], and fullback Jim Harris. Looks like his pants are down around his ankles. [Harris stops and waves]"
1588,16,8,"Voice-Over, Announcer, Commentator","Somebody should let him know. Oh, and Old Surehand Mike Tafthill [a black alumnus who's stooped and walking slowly holding an imaginary tray], who seems to be baking an imaginary cake, Dan."
1589,16,8,Dan,"Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something."
1590,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it."
1591,16,8,Stan Marsh,"You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports."
1592,16,8,Butters Stotch,"That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking."
1593,16,8,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Butters."
1594,16,8,Dan,And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
1595,16,8,Randy Marsh,"All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays."
1596,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,We don't have kickoffs anymore. [only the TV is heard for a few seconds]
1597,16,8,Randy Marsh,[looks at Kyle] Huh?
1598,16,8,Stan Marsh,"The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore."
1599,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[stands up as his eyes widen to saucers] Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!"
1600,16,8,Principal Victoria,"[flanked by Mr. Adler and Mr. Mackey] Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?"
1601,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?"
1602,16,8,Mr Mackey,"Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?"
1603,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[becoming sarcastic] Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!"
1604,16,8,Mr Adler,Bras?
1605,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! [other parents look at each other and whisper amongst themselves]"
1606,16,8,Linda Stotch,How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
1607,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!"
1608,16,8,Mr Mackey,Huh. You you think the students would like that?
1609,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it ""sarcastaball""?!"
1610,16,8,Mr Mackey,"Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?"
1611,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[angry that no one is with him on this - that is, that no one has caught on to his sarcasm] Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!"
1612,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, do we really have to wear bras?"
1613,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. [thumbs up]"
1614,16,8,Butters Stotch,"I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?"
1615,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it."
1616,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh, [passing Clyde and Kevin] you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!"
1617,16,8,Principal Victoria,"[walks up to Randy] How's it going, coach?"
1618,16,8,Randy Marsh,How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
1619,16,8,Principal Victoria,So you're happy with these changes?
1620,16,8,Randy Marsh,Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
1621,16,8,Principal Victoria,[surveys the situation and decides to leave] Okay. [The boys are still hugging each other and Randy blows his whistle]
1622,16,8,Anchor,"Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says ""No,"" and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds."
1623,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball! [the crowd waits a second, then applauds] Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide! [the crowd applauds and cheers] Go on, pat yourselves on the back! [and so the crowd members turn and pat each other on the back]"
1624,16,8,Anchor,"Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington."
1625,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[addressing Congress] Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! [Congress applauds. The President and his wife are present, and clap with Congress.]"
1626,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,[removes his bra and throws it to the floor] This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
1627,16,8,Clyde Donovan,I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
1628,16,8,Stan Marsh,This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
1629,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you know what? [removes his bra and throws it to the floor] Screw this!"
1630,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing! [silence] We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!"
1631,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,We don't even understand how this game is played.
1632,16,8,Butters Stotch,"This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met! [walks up to Token] Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know. [walks up to Clyde] And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!"
1633,16,8,Eric Cartman,That's true.
1634,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us? [stands on a bench] Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!"
1635,16,8,Clyde Donovan,Yeah.
1636,16,8,Kenny McCormick,Yeah.
1637,16,8,Butters Stotch,"And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!"
1638,16,8,Boys,Yeah!
1639,16,8,Butters Stotch,"And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!"
1640,16,8,Boys,[jumping up and down] Yeah! Yeah!
1641,16,8,Eric Cartman,"[puts his bra back on] Let's do this. [turns his back towards Stan] Stan, hook up my bra."
1642,16,8,Roger Goodell,"As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh. [Randy gets applause from the audience as he rises. Goodell shakes Randy's hand] Congratulations, Marsh. Good job!"
1643,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!"
1644,16,8,Roger Goodell,Nice going!
1645,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, no, you nice going! [they're still shaking hands]"
1646,16,8,Photographer,"Hey guys, how about a nice fucking picture to welcome in the future of sports? [click]"
1647,16,8,Announcer,Welcome to the inaugural game of the National Sarcastaball League! As we bring you today's matchup between the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders.
1648,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! [crosses his arms]"
1649,16,8,24,"Give them hell, coach! Lovin', not shovin'!"
1650,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, good one! [the crowd begins to cheer the teams]"
1651,16,8,Announcer,"And now, here are your Denver Whoop de fucking do girls!"
1652,16,8,Cheerleaders,Woo! Woo!
1653,16,8,Cheerleader 1,Go Broncos! Go!
1654,16,8,Cheerleader 2,Whoop de fuckin' do!
1655,16,8,Announcer,"And now, here to sing the sarcastaball anthem, recording artist, Cee-Lo!"
1656,16,8,Cee Lo Green,"I love sarcastaball
It's so much better than football
I'm so glad they got rid of violence in sports
'Cause sarcastaball is so super fun to watch"
1657,16,8,Fan 1,"Woo! Nice job, Cee-Lo! Good to see you on TV some more!"
1658,16,8,Fan 2,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your hit songs!"
1659,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?"
1660,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us."
1661,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
1662,16,8,Stan Marsh,[stops and faces his friends] I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
1663,16,8,Clyde Donovan,"Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. [looks down at the floor]"
1664,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,We can't.
1665,16,8,Clyde Donovan,"[somewhat cross] We don't have a coach, Kyle."
1666,16,8,Eric Cartman,Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
1667,16,8,Butters Stotch,Huh?
1668,16,8,Craig Tucker,Hey yeah.
1669,16,8,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Butters] The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory."
1670,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas."
1671,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you understand this game better than anybody."
1672,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything."
1673,16,8,Stan Marsh,Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
1674,16,8,Butters Stotch,'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. [sticks out his tongue a bit]
1675,16,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps in] We need you, Butters. You're the man! [Butters begins to feel the anticipation]"
1676,16,8,The Team,Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters!
1677,16,8,Butters' Fangirls (in a dream),"Butters, rah, Butters!"
1678,16,8,A Fangirl,"I love you, Butters!"
1679,16,8,Butters Stotch,"[stops his car and looks at the girls] I love you too, ladies. [blows them a kiss]"
1680,16,8,Wendy Testaburger,"[to Butters' left] Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams."
1681,16,8,Red,"[slides in to Butters' right] Leave him alone, Wendy! He's mine! [they each take a cheek and plant a big kiss on him.]"
1682,16,8,Butters Stotch,Woohoohoohoohoo!
1683,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Wuh wuuuhhh wuh! [sits up] Wha? Wha? Oh. [smiles, Then looks under the covers] Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again. [the door opens and Stephen steps in] More of my creamy goo came out. [Stephen sits on the bed]"
1684,16,8,Stephen Stotch,"Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night."
1685,16,8,Butters Stotch,"[excitedly] I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!"
1686,16,8,Stephen Stotch,"All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it."
1687,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Okay Dad! [Stephen gets up and walks out, and Butters opens up the top drawer of his night stand. He pulls out a small bottle, gets comfortable again, and collects up all the cream] Oh! Saaave that, for later. [puts a cap on the bottle]"
1688,16,8,Announcer,The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos.
1689,16,8,Cheerleader 1,"Go Broncos, Go."
1690,16,8,Dan,"Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in. [the ref blows his whistle and raises his arms] Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!"
1691,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[clapping slowly] Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!"
1692,16,8,Dan,"They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge. [the judge looks at the replay monitor, then looks at the field]"
1693,16,8,Side Judge,"Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!"
1694,16,8,Randy Marsh,YEAH! [pumps his fist] YEAH! WOO!
1695,16,8,Reporter 1,"Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner."
1696,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. [covers his chest with his hands]"
1697,16,8,Reporter 1,"Coach Belichick says, [reads from a small notepad] ""No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day."""
1698,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!"
1699,16,8,Reporter 2,Guess we'll find out on Sunday.
1700,16,8,Randy Marsh,...Yeah... [the press leaves and Randy begins to think about next week]
1701,16,8,Randy Marsh,"All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow."
1702,16,8,Broncos (including Peyton Manning),D'awwwww!
1703,16,8,Manning,Practice on Monday after a victory? Great!
1704,16,8,Randy Marsh,"That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better."
1705,16,8,Manning,Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!
1706,16,8,Randy Marsh,That's IT! [claps approvingly]
1707,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey Butters, you got a minute?"
1708,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Wuh sure, Eric. [Cartman walks in and Butters closes the door]"
1709,16,8,Eric Cartman,"I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor."
1710,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player."
1711,16,8,Eric Cartman,"No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters."
1712,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?"
1713,16,8,Eric Cartman,...I don't have a dad.
1714,16,8,Butters Stotch,"...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out. [remembers looking at his groin and saying ""Oh jeez, there's a lot this time.""] But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings."
1715,16,8,Eric Cartman,Youuu save it all?
1716,16,8,Butters Stotch,"My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. [before them is a wall of semen samples that Butters has been collecting for over a year now. Another shot shows that he's going on two years' worth of semen, with shelves of it on the other two walls]"
1717,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?"
1718,16,8,Butters Stotch,"I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. [Cartman takes a bottle and chugs it down, then analyzes the flavor]"
1719,16,8,Eric Cartman,"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor."
1720,16,8,Butters Stotch,Do you feel warm and compassionate?
1721,16,8,Eric Cartman,[analyzes some more...] Holy shit I think I do.
1722,16,8,Jim Rome,"Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling. [Randy Marsh appears on the monitor via satellite from his den] Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show."
1723,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show."
1724,16,8,Jim Rome,"Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go."
1725,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this."
1726,16,8,Jim Rome,Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times. [POV switch to Randy's den] Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times.
1727,16,8,Randy Marsh,Thanks Jim. [closes the satellite link and switches to a window about sarcastaball strategies and starts working on them. Sharon walks in]
1728,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?"
1729,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?"
1730,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?"
1731,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!"
1732,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain."
1733,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!"
1734,16,8,Sharon Marsh,Do you mean that?
1735,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yes! I totally mean it! [breaks down and begins to tear up] Help me, Sharon. Help me."
1736,16,8,Butters Stotch,"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. [Cartman approaches North Park's #7 and knocks him down. A referee sees this, blows his whistle and walks over to the two players]"
1737,16,8,Spectators,Awwwwww!
1738,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you idiot!"
1739,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up! [the team huddles - er, cuddles up and Butters continues.] Now what is goin' on out there?"
1740,16,8,Eric Cartman,That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
1741,16,8,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters."
1742,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. [Butters passes bottles of his semen around to the other boys, and they all drink the bottles down]"
1743,16,8,Doctor,"Uh hum. Mmm. [turns towards Randy and Sharon] I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage."
1744,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[dejected] Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better."
1745,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"How do we fix this, doctor?"
1746,16,8,Doctor,"You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain."
1747,16,8,Randy Marsh,So that's it. [gets up and walks around] I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! [points to the doctor]
1748,16,8,Doctor,"Ohh, rreally? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball? [gets into a thinking mode] Really? [rolls his eyes] That's fascinating. Please, go on."
1749,16,8,Randy Marsh,"No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse."
1750,16,8,Doctor,"You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains."
1751,16,8,Randy Marsh,My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
1752,16,8,Doctor,"Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say ""Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain."""
1753,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! [turns left and leaves, and Sharon is thoroughly confused. She looks around]"
1754,16,8,Jim Rome,"Jim Rome here. Hey, I love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's so thrilling I need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game. That's when I reach for a bottle of this. [holds up a small bottle, now in mass production] Butters' Creamy Goo. [the commercial follows]"
1755,16,8,Voice Over,"[#18 runs with the balloon] You play hard. You need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost. [a split screen appears, with windows for football, basketball, women's soccer, and hockey] Sports these days are all about being nice, so take your game to the next level [#18 opens up a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo and drinks it]. With Butters' Creamy Goo. [a cyclist opens a bottle and drinks it. Some of it splatters on his face] You'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine. [a round window expands and Butters pops in through it]"
1756,16,8,Butters Stotch,Like me!
1757,16,8,Jim Rome,"Get with it, and get the Goo!"
1758,16,8,Voice Over,Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size!
1759,16,8,12,"When I get hot and tired, only one thing can boost my compassion. [drinks it down and keeps it there with some effort. A goo mustache stays on his upper lip] Now I'm back in the game! [Two players carry a bucket of goo and dump it on their coach.]"
1760,16,8,Singer in Commercial,Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!
1761,16,8,Voice Over,[an open bottle of it falls right side up to the grass and some goo spills out] Best served just above room temperature.
1762,16,8,Butters Stotch,"42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT! [Cartman tosses the balloon back at him, and the players move forward. Butters backs up for a pass and throws the balloon up. The other team's player, #9, is ready] Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it! [#9 catches it and grins] Good job, kid! [an SUV rools onto the field, crushing #9 before it stops. The balloon bounces away unscathed. Randy is shown driving the SUV, with Sharon in tow]"
1763,16,8,Randy Marsh,STAN?! Stan! [the players break their hugs and look at Randy]
1764,16,8,Stan Marsh,Dad?
1765,16,8,Randy Marsh,"[runs with Sharon towards him] Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!"
1766,16,8,Stan Marsh,What?
1767,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore."
1768,16,8,Mr Mackey,"Hey, get off the field! M'kay?! [Randy walks to the sideline to address the crowd]"
1769,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe. [a lot of fans have bought bottles of Butters' Creamy Goo] Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh! [gets a headache] Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again. [clears his throat again] Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would- [stomps his right foot in anger] God damn it!"
1770,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!"
1771,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!"
1772,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!"
1773,16,8,Sharon Marsh,Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
1774,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!"
1775,16,8,Sharon Marsh,"[stunned at the sarcasm coming from Stan] Ohohh Randy, it's happening! [cries and turns towards Randy for a hug, which he gives]"
1776,16,8,Butters Stotch,"[walks up and stands next to Stan] Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along."
1777,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!"
1778,16,8,Stan Marsh,"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere?"
1779,16,8,Randy Marsh,I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
1780,16,8,Eric Cartman,That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
1781,16,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah Dad. You need some of this. [walks forward and gives him a small bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo. Randy takes it and opens it, looking at the contents, then drinks it]"
1782,16,8,Randy Marsh,...[deadpans] This is cum. [everyone's jaws drop]
1783,16,8,Stephen Stotch,"And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done! [Butters is on his bed, looking chastened] Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to ""Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?""! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!"
1784,16,8,Butters Stotch,What's sarcasm and what's cum?
1785,16,8,Stephen Stotch,We'll talk about that when you're older!
1786,16,8,Randy Marsh,"Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. [all the adults leave, with Stephen closing the door behind him. Butters sighs, then gets under his covers for the night. As he drifts off to sleep, we get this voice-over]"
1787,16,8,Jim Rome,"Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but ""So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you."" Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days."
1788,16,8,Butters Stotch,[wakes up and gasps] DAD! Hey Dad!
1789,16,8,Stephen Stotch,[walks in] What?!
1790,16,8,Butters Stotch,My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
1791,16,8,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend."
1792,16,8,Butters Stotch,"Thanks, Dad."
1793,16,9,Stan Marsh,"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?"
1794,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[looks over his left shoulder] Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? [looks at the gloves again]"
1795,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat."
1796,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns left to address Kyle] I'm not fat, Kyle."
1797,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Right, you're not fat."
1798,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like [that] bitch! [they see a scooter rolls past them with an obese man on it]"
1799,16,9,Stan Marsh,Whoa duude!
1800,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? [another obese man rolls up behind them]"
1801,16,9,Obese Man,"Excuse me. [They just look up at him] Excuse me! [they part the aisle for him - Stan, Cartman and Kenny take the side with the gloves on it, Kyle takes the other side,]"
1802,16,9,Eric Cartman,See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
1803,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why do they even allow those things in stored?
1804,16,9,Stan Marsh,"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. [Indeed, a small fleet of them are available for rent, at $19.99 each. They're labeled as electric wheelchairs. Obese people are in line as one after another of them rents a Rascal. The boys turn a corner to have a look at the Rascals as they're being rented]"
1805,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,You've gotta be kidding me!
1806,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[eyes some Oreos and goes for them] Oh my God you guys, look at this! [grabs a box and reads it] Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling. [closes his eyes and looks up joyfully] Holy hell yes!"
1807,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all?? [an obese man and an obese woman squeeze past each other in an aisle on their scooters.] That's YOU one day, fatass![Stan and Kenny leave] Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! [turns and follows Stan and Kenny away. Cartman is left alone with the Oreos and his thoughts]"
1808,16,9,Obese Lady and Two Obese Men,[rolls up in her Rascal] Are those Candy Corn Oreos?
1809,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah... Yeah, here you go. [walks over, tosses them into her basket, and walks away with his head down]"
1810,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?"
1811,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why? [his eyebrows move to odd positions every so often]
1812,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[walks in] I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart. [stops] You're right Kyle. I'm fat. [sighs] All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck."
1813,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-"
1814,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it. [walks out of the house. Kyle is puzzled. Moments later, Cartman returns on a Rascal and rolls on into Kyle's living room] Sweeeeeeeeeet!"
1815,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,[angrily]Oh no!
1816,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. [begins to ride in a circle around Kyle]"
1817,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,You don't need that! Get off of it.
1818,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[stops] Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. [rides away]"
1819,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!"
1820,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[reaches the restroom and tries to get it, but the base is too wide] Hmm. [tries again. Kyle catches up] I can't. [tries again] I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. [tries again]"
1821,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,What??
1822,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle. [tries again] You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. [tries again]"
1823,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,So take a shit somewhere else!
1824,16,9,Eric Cartman,"That's not the way this country works, Kyle. [tries again] Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter. [tries again] It's the law."
1825,16,9,Gerald Broflovski,[arrives] What's going on down here?
1826,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[tries again] Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible. [tries again] I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit. [backs out and prepares to leave] Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. [rolls away. Kyle looks on angrily]"
1827,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[""Nobody understands how embarrassing it is to live with obesity."" He rides past a couple] Out of the way. Out of the way please. [""Wherever you go, you're treated differently"" He arrives at a Denny's]"
1828,16,9,Denny's Greeter,Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window. [Cartman goes towards the booth and grins]
1829,16,9,Ticket Teller,"Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh..."
1830,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Coming through. Oh how humiliating. [now at the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland: ""But even at Disneyland I get reminded of my weight."" He rolls into the short line] Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel. [reaches the front of the line] Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have- [finds a line of other scooter riders in front of him] Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!"
1831,16,9,Legless Boy,I don't have legs.
1832,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well you got skinny arms! [Later on, Cartman rolls through Cnderella's Castle. ""And then even Disneyland can't take away the shame, as all the people suffering from obesity are ignored. Like, we're invisible."" A woman's baby carriage gets in the way and she quickly pulls it back as Cartman rolls towards the exits] 'Scuse me. Move it."
1833,16,9,Eric Cartman,"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy? [chokes up and begins to sob] At Besty Buy I'm sorry. [At the defense table sits a Best Buy employee, looking around] To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom? [reaches for a long-handled grip with his left hand, then uses it to take a tissue from the judge's bench. He grabs the tissue with his right hand and lowers the grip, then blows his nose] Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?"
1834,16,9,Anchor,"More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping."
1835,16,9,Obese Man 2,"[being jostled in his Rascal by a group of boys] Stop it you kids! sto- Oop- Owww.[the boys succeed in tipping him over and the man is on his side unable to get up. The kids laugh and scatter, and the man begins to sound like a pig] Weak! Weak!"
1836,16,9,Anchor,"The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. [The device is shown, and it resembles a telescoping cane]"
1837,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. [facing him is the rest of the fourth grade class]"
1838,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,You have got to be kidding me!
1839,16,9,Eric Cartman,"What, Kyle?! [the device then collapses and puts itself away]"
1840,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
1841,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[rolls up to him] You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!"
1842,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
1843,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh! Oh, did you hear him?! [rolls back to the workers] This is exactly what Adele is talking about! [begins to pace back and forth] Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle! [rolls up to Kyle] Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day [rolls away] to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers! [rolls back up to Kyle] You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look! [rolls to the far end of the gum] I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!"
1844,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Who's Honey Boo Boo?
1845,16,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?"
1846,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches. [at a pageant, onstage, dressed to win] I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!"
1847,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew."
1848,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"[back in her trophy room] I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!"
1849,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"[at a pageant, performs some chest compressions on Honey] Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo! [Honey Boo Boo comes to] Now get up and wave to them judges! [later on, to the camera] We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy. [Stan and Kyle are watching the show in Stan's living room. Kyle gets up and walks off]"
1850,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore."
1851,16,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing."
1852,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,This is it! Throttle down!
1853,16,9,A crewman,"[voice only] Throttle down! [Cameron leaves the bridge and goes on deck, putting on a diving suit]"
1854,16,9,Crewman 1,"Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?"
1855,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
1856,16,9,Crewman 1,"The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron."
1857,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters? [points at him] How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME. [puts on some gloves and gets into a bathysphere. He closes the hatch and locks himself in] Let her go! [two workers pull down the release switches in unison. The crane releases the bathysphere and... it hits the deck below. It rolls to one side towards the edge and then drops off. Under the water, as it sinks, Cameron gets to work] UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on."
1858,16,9,"News Anchor, Announcer, Singers","His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron."
1859,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
1860,16,9,"News Anchor, Announcer, Singers","James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea"
1861,16,9,Crewman 1,"Yes, James, we hear the song."
1862,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.
1863,16,9,"News Anchor, Announcer, Singers",With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.
1864,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, hurry it up in there! [inside, a toilet and the two urinals have been removed to make room for the wheelchair-accessible toilet. Cartman rolls up the ramp to get to the toilet]"
1865,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. [gets off the Rascal]"
1866,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[starting to fume, steps away from the crowd] This has gone far enough! [the other boys turn to look at him] How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!"
1867,16,9,Token Black,"Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness."
1868,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
1869,16,9,Token Black,"Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television."
1870,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?"
1871,16,9,Token Black,"[walks up to Kyle] At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything."
1872,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right."
1873,16,9,Token Black,"Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air."
1874,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! [walks away smiling. Token watches him leave, then walks off in the opposite direction. The rest of the boys go back to waiting at the restroom door. Craig watches Kyle leave, then notices Token and follows him]"
1875,16,9,Craig Tucker,"Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth."
1876,16,9,Token Black,"He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. [hurries away]"
1877,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. [clicks on a remote to turn down the lights]"
1878,16,9,Token Black,"[voice over. Cartman is shown rolling down the street] He's chubby, [Cartman is shown at a table with lots of courses for him to go through] he's filthy [Cartman belches], and he's just a little bit nuts. [sideswipes a letter carrier and then gives him the finger] Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! [""Here Comes Fatty Doo Doo"" appears onscreen with a picture of Cartman on his Rascal, with his back to the camera]"
1879,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,Fatty Doo Doo?
1880,16,9,Randy Newman,"Who's that scootin' on a scooter? Fatty Doo Doo
Who's got doodoo like a fatty scoop de do?"
1881,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1882,16,9,Randy Newman,"Nobody scoots a fatty doo like you do.
Scatty foo foo
Patty poo poo
White president, black president, I don't care.
Just scoop me up some doodoo and I'll be right there.
I. Only. Know. Five. Chords. Six-"
1883,16,9,Token Black,Come in.
1884,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,[enters and approaches the desk] What have you done?
1885,16,9,Token Black,"I helped you make a documentary, Kyle."
1886,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!"
1887,16,9,Token Black,"Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television."
1888,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??"
1889,16,9,Token Black,"[hops off his chair and walks to a window] I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel. [turns around and faces Kyle] If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?"
1890,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?"
1891,16,9,Token Black,"But she's not black, Kyle. She's white. [a few seconds of silence] The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up. [faces the window again] Not by us, or anyone else."
1892,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,You guys seeing this?!
1893,16,9,Crewman 1,"Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron."
1894,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five."
1895,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?"
1896,16,9,Stan Marsh,"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?"
1897,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo."
1898,16,9,Stan Marsh,"[alarmed, gets up and walks up to Kyle] Dude! Dude, not cool!"
1899,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1900,16,9,Stan Marsh,Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
1901,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,[a bit shocked] What? Oh my God.
1902,16,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah dude. It's really serious.
1903,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog."
1904,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,[clapping] I'mm gettin' a piiig heaaart.
1905,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!"
1906,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,I waunt that one!
1907,16,9,Farmer,This one here? [picks up a sow near them and shows off the sow's belly] You want this one??
1908,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,Yeah! No wait! That pig over there gave me the evil eye! I wuant that one! I waunt [squeezes her eyes closed for a second] that one!
1909,16,9,Farmer,This one? [picks up a sow near them and shows off the sow's belly] this one right here?? Ya waunt this one??
1910,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,I want that one's heart! It looked at me funny!
1911,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart. [looks over her shoulder] Honey Boo Boo! [no response] Honey BOO BOO!
1912,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,What?!
1913,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?
1914,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"I'm gonna tell them ""my heart is sweeter than bacon, child!"" [Mama turns back to the camera and grins]"
1915,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,Who waunts sketti and butter? [pig noises are heard and the camera pans down to show Honey Boo Boo crawling all over the floor] She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!
1916,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"This is myyy scaaar 'cause I got a pig heart. My scar makes me sassy, child! [blows a kiss to the camera]"
1917,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"S. S. Cameron? This is James Cameron. I am now at... 16,000 feet. You should see the cold darkness of it all. The isolation and yet awwwe of the sea's magnitude. I have now sunk deeper than any human has ever been before! [he soon encounters another man in a diving suit]"
1918,16,9,Randy Newman,We are here in the ocean depths goin' deep deep deep- [turns around and sees the bathysphere... and its pilot] Oh hey James Cameron.
1919,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,What the fuck?!
1920,16,9,Randy Newman,I've been divin' in the deep and I'm feelin' so cheap.
1921,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!
1922,16,9,Randy Newman,"I don't want anyone raisin' the bar, 'cause nobody'll hire me! Deep deep deep in the ocean. Ohhh, come on. Fight me, Cameron."
1923,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell! [maneuvers the bathysphere's arms and lands a right punch on Newman, who falls away in slow motion]"
1924,16,9,Eric Cartman,"It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!"
1925,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger."
1926,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer! [the lawyer appears outside the office and tries to enter, but can't. The lawyer is on his own Rascal] As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!"
1927,16,9,Token Black,[waits a second] It actually aired last night.
1928,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,You found a network to buy it?
1929,16,9,Token Black,"Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo."
1930,16,9,Eric Cartman,What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
1931,16,9,Token Black,"Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-"
1932,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[begins riding around] I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! [turns around and rides out of the office]"
1933,16,9,Announcer,"We welcome you to the First Lady's Symposium on Obesity, with your keynote speaker, Michelle Obama. [the audience applauds]"
1934,16,9,Michelle Obama and her aide,"Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention. [Kyle is present, which means Cartman didn't fly alone] A conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. What will we do as a country? I cannot give you any easy answers. But what I can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! Honey Boo Boo versus Fatty Poo Poo! [the audience cheers loudly as the bell rings and two men pour sketti and butter onto the grass with five-gallon pots. Token is at Cartman's corner and Mama is at Honey's corner]"
1935,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[making 8's with his Rascal and itching for a fight] You're goin' down, bitch! [also in attendance are Butters, Stan, Kevin, and Craig] Nobody takes my ratings!"
1936,16,9,Token Black,"That's good, Fatty, get pissed!"
1937,16,9,Eric Cartman,I'm pissed!
1938,16,9,Token Black,"Yeah, Fatty!"
1939,16,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!"
1940,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"[clapping] Ain't nobody can beat my Boo Boo at sketti wrestlin'! [meanwhile, Honey Boo Boo is striking poses and blowing kisses non-stop]"
1941,16,9,Michelle Obama and her aide,Let's do this! [the contestants approach each other in the center of the sketti ring as the audience cheers and applauds wildly. Cartman suddenly rushes at her and sideswipes her]
1942,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,[falling to the ground] Ow!
1943,16,9,Eric Cartman,"I ain't done with you, bitch!"
1944,16,9,Man,Yeah! Tip assist!
1945,16,9,Crewman 2,You think he's dead? [the first crewman wakes up]
1946,16,9,Crewman 3,I hope so.
1947,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar! [the crewmen begin to stir. Soon they're all gathered at the computer monitor] Divert all power to sub systems! Two percent oxygen left! [the bethysphere rises quickly, followed by a long cable] The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch!"
1948,16,9,Crewman 4,Well I'll be damned.
1949,16,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you okay? [Honey Boo Boo gets up, and Cartman turns back to strike her down again]"
1950,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again and looks at Cartman, and he strikes her down once again] Did it start with fat people on scooters?[Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] Or did the bar get lowered way before that? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]And then I started thinking, maybe it was us. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] There's no going back, Stan. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again. Two men walk up behind Stan and Kyle, and pass by them]"
1951,16,9,Man 2,"Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again. Stan notices the men]"
1952,16,9,Man 3,"I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]"
1953,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,[catches a hint of what the men were talking about] Huh?
1954,16,9,Aide,"[Michelle Obama looks a little faint] Ms. Obama, are you, uh, ma'am? Are you okay?"
1955,16,9,Michelle Obama and her aide,Something's wrong. This... This is all wrong! [runs into the sketti ring] Stop! Everyone! What are we doing?! How can you let this happen to your daughter?!
1956,16,9,Honey Boo Boo and Mama,"I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done??"
1957,16,9,Man 4,When did we devolve into watching fat kids sketti wrestling?
1958,16,9,Michelle Obama and her aide,We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity! [turns to Cartman and begins punching away at him]
1959,16,9,Eric Cartman,"[amid some ows and grunts] Oh! You fucking bitch! [Michelle Obama finally punches him off his Rascal. She picks it up over her head, then smashes it into the ground, breaking it. She then kicks Cartman in the stomach for good measure.]"
1960,16,9,Token Black,What the hell is going on?
1961,16,9,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
1962,16,9,Crewman 5,"Hey Cameron, we can't believe it."
1963,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,We're done here! Set course for the set of Avatar 2
1964,16,9,Crewman 6,Mr. Cameron. [Cameron stops] People should know. How you saved us all? How you raised the bar? How will they know what a hero you are?
1965,16,9,James Cameron and his crew,"[turns around] James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron. [turns around and walks a few feet, then turns around again] James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron. [the crew applauds him as he enters the bridge]"
1966,16,9,"News Anchor, Announcer, Singers","His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron."
1967,16,10,Announcer,"Erectile dysfunction is a fact of life. You want to show her you love her, but you're old, and so is she. [A middle-aged man brings two cups of wine to the sofa and gives one of them to his middle-aged wife. Next, another middle-aged couple is shown in a row boat, with the husband rowing... slowly] The next time that special moment comes, don't let your sex drive fail you just because your wife looks like a shriveled prune. Fake it, with Cialis. [The Cialis logo scoots in from the right] It won't make her any harder, but it will make you not care for up to three hours. [A third couple is shown holding hands in his-and-her bathrubs on a deck... on the African savannah, with two elephants in the distance.] And then you can still have your own separate bathrub from her later on. [Gerald glances over at Sheila.]"
1968,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,[Lowers his arms and leans in a bit] Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
1969,16,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?"
1970,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,[Puts his left arm around her] How about I put on the uniform?
1971,16,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Gets excited and bashful] Oh, Gerald..."
1972,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
1973,16,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, hello. [Strikes a sexy pose - right arm on the door, left arm on her hip]"
1974,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
1975,16,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed."
1976,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,"If you'll just... [Whips out a signature pad and presents it to her] sign right here. [Some time later, the bedroom door is closed, the lights are out, and Gerald is really delivering it to Sheila.]"
1977,16,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!"
1978,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah? [Spanks her] Do you like your package, ma'am? [Unknown to them, Ike is standing at the doorway looking at them]"
1979,16,10,Sheila Broflovski,Oh yes!
1980,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,Huh? [Followed by a series of grunts]
1981,16,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Do it harder, UPS man!"
1982,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, what's the matter? [Waits a few seconds, then goes in.] Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on? [Ike finishes up and hands the sheet of paper to Kyle. Kyle looks and is suddenly alarmed. Ike has drawn a stick figure of his mom with a UPS man, with big boobs for his mom and a big penis for the UPS man. Ike goes back to crying] Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?"
1983,16,10,Ike Broflovski,Yes! Yes!
1984,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-"
1985,16,10,Ike Broflovski,"I saw them, Kyle, I saw them!"
1986,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no...
1987,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do."
1988,16,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what happened?"
1989,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,Take a look. [Whips out the sheet of paper Ike drew upon]
1990,16,10,Stan Marsh,What's this? [Takes the sheet and looks at it.]
1991,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
1992,16,10,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
1993,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Dude, no way!"
1994,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah dude. [Out in the hall, Randy walks by with a cup of coffee, but he hears them and stops]"
1995,16,10,Stan Marsh,"But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex? [Randy sees a plant nearby, quickly dumps his coffee into it, and puts the cup against Stan's door]"
1996,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time."
1997,16,10,Randy Marsh,[Barely audible] Ohhhh... [Hurries away]
1998,16,10,Stan Marsh,Well are you gonna tell your dad?
1999,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
2000,16,10,Eric Cartman,"[Walks up to him] Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?"
2001,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2002,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?"
2003,16,10,Stan Marsh,"Cartman dude, not now."
2004,16,10,Eric Cartman,"No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!"
2005,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?"
2006,16,10,Jimbo,"How do you tell him? ""Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife."" It's really none of our business."
2007,16,10,Stuart McCormick,"If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!"
2008,16,10,Stephen Stotch,"How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!"
2009,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?"
2010,16,10,Mechanic,"Wouldn't be the first time. [The other men face him] Hyeah, there's a price to be paid with having things convenient. Used to be... a man had to go to the store to buy himself a pitcher of milk. Hyeah, but men got lazy. They wanted that milk delivered right to the door. Only problem was, the guy deliverin' that milk end sup fuckin' your wife. Sure, you had your nice cold milk delivered right to your doorstep, but your wife was gettin' pounded out like a mallard duck. [takes his hat and heads for the entrance, then turns around] And now you got your Amazon. [puts on his hat] And the milkman's come back. [turns around] And none of ya are safe. [walks away, leaving the other men stunned]"
2011,16,10,Security Agent,"And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all."
2012,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh no, really?"
2013,16,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this."
2014,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!"
2015,16,10,Liane Cartman,Ohhh...
2016,16,10,Security Agent,"Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days."
2017,16,10,Eric Cartman,What-what do you mean?
2018,16,10,Security Agent,"Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows."
2019,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!"
2020,16,10,Security Agent,"We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?"
2021,16,10,Eric Cartman,Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
2022,16,10,Sharon Marsh,"Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?"
2023,16,10,Randy Marsh,"No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer. [The doorbell rings] I'll get it. [Rises quickly and heads for the front door]"
2024,16,10,UPS Man,"[Holding two boxes] Hey there, looks like I got a couple of packagers from Amazon for ya."
2025,16,10,Randy Marsh,"[Warily] Oh, is that so?"
2026,16,10,UPS Man,If I can just get your signature right [Whips out the signature pad] there?
2027,16,10,Randy Marsh,"[Signs the pad] Sure um... Chad, is it?"
2028,16,10,UPS Man,Thad.
2029,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?"
2030,16,10,UPS Man,"Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone."
2031,16,10,Randy Marsh,Yeah I'll bet. [Gives him the pad back. Thad does a couple more things on the pad]
2032,16,10,UPS Man,"[Gives Randy the packages and walks back to his truck] Well, have a good one."
2033,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, you too, Thad. [Closes the door and walks back to the kitchen. He puts the packages down on the counter next to the sink] Hey Sharon, these came for you."
2034,16,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Smiles] Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?"
2035,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, w-what are they?"
2036,16,10,Sharon Marsh,"You know, to be honest, I can't remember?"
2037,16,10,Randy Marsh,[In a deeper voice] You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
2038,16,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Opens the larger box] Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy. [puts the knives back in the box and opens the smaller box] oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?"
2039,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, sure, 'cause... [backs out of the kitchen] people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. [goes upstairs]"
2040,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you got something from Amazon. [looks around and doesn't see Stan] Oh. [goes to Stan's desk and drops the book off there. He notices Ike's drawing and takes it, looks closely at it and gasps, thinking the drawing is of Sharon and the UPS man] Ooohhh shit."
2041,16,10,Eric Cartman,Oh fuck. [Goes to the touchpad by the door to shut it off] Oh what's the- God damn it! [The phone rings and he goes to answer it. He puts his left index finger in his left ear to hear from the right ear better] Hello?
2042,16,10,Jeff,This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
2043,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!"
2044,16,10,Jeff,That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?
2045,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew. [Thinks a moment] No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew."
2046,16,10,Jeff,"Okay, I've got something a little different here."
2047,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere."
2048,16,10,Jeff,No problem.
2049,16,10,Eric Cartman,Sorry about this.
2050,16,10,Jeff,"It's all right, it happens all the time."
2051,16,10,Eric Cartman,"'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!"
2052,16,10,Jeff,You want to rape your mom?
2053,16,10,Eric Cartman,"[Liane appears at the top of the stairs and becomes coming down, but stops to hear what Eric is saying] That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!"
2054,16,10,Jeff,You said you lived there.
2055,16,10,Eric Cartman,"[His mom goes back up the stairs] I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!"
2056,16,10,Randy Marsh,How did you get rid of him? [The mechanic looks at him] How did you get rid of the milkman?
2057,16,10,Mechanic,"There's no getting rid of him. Not in any you folks would be prepared for. Noh, best you just let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he'll get tired of it."
2058,16,10,Stephen Stotch,"Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore! [The others look at him, he looks around] This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now."
2059,16,10,Randy Marsh,[Puts his hands on the table] You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
2060,16,10,Mechanic,"We used a pretty blonde to lure him in. When she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub. She took off her clothes and... asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk. The milkman said, ""You want that milk pasteurize?"" And the blonde replied, ""No, just up to my boobs. I can splash it in my eyes."" That's when we jumped 'im. It was over in minutes. Then we burned his body. You wanna get rid of the milkman? You gotta kill him and kill him good. And then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on."
2061,16,10,Cat Burglar,"Hey, ey uh, [Takes a puff of cigarette] you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid!"
2062,16,10,Eric Cartman,"You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it? [closes and locks the door, then arms the system, then goes to the phone to wait for Wolf Home Security to call. The cat burglar pounds a window until it gives way and he goes in. The alarm goes off a second later. Cartman gets pissed off when the burglar breaks a second window and there's no response from Wolf. Finally the call comes in, and Cartman answers it] Hello?"
2063,16,10,Michael,This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
2064,16,10,Eric Cartman,"[The cat burglar appears as he goes towards the stairs. He then stops] Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom. [Softly, to the cat burglar while muffling the mic] Go go, she's upstairs. [The cat burglar heads up the stairs] Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!"
2065,16,10,Michael,"Oh-kay, should we contact the police?"
2066,16,10,Eric Cartman,Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
2067,16,10,Michael,"Okay, we're contacting them now."
2068,16,10,Eric Cartman,"He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!"
2069,16,10,Michael,"Try and stay calm, the police are on their way."
2070,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out! [Looks at the phone] The fuck?!"
2071,16,10,UPS Man,"Hey there, misterrr Stotch. looks like another Amazon package. [Smiles]"
2072,16,10,Stephen Stotch,I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.
2073,16,10,UPS Man,[looks puzzled] ...Sss-sorry?
2074,16,10,Stephen Stotch,"Just let me sign. [the UPS man hands him the signature pad, Stephen signs it and gives it back and gets his package, and the UPS man leaves. Stephen opens the box and pulls out a Bane mask, still in the plastic package. Then he whips out a flip phone from his back pocket and talks into it] All right, he's coming to you."
2075,16,10,Voice,"Well hello there, Mr. UPS man!"
2076,16,10,UPS Man,What are you-?
2077,16,10,Randy Marsh,[wearing his own Bane mask] You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
2078,16,10,UPS Man,"[the UPS man releases the hand brake and drives off] Look, you can have whatever's in the back! Ih-ihit's all stuff from Amazon!"
2079,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Oh no, pull in here."
2080,16,10,UPS Man,"Just let me go, huh?"
2081,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! [the driver's side door opens and the other men from the bar, also wearing Bane masks, drag the UPS man out]"
2082,16,10,UPS Man,Aaawwgh! [they take turns kicking and punching him]
2083,16,10,Stephen Stotch,"You should have never come to our town! [punches him twice, the second one sending him to Stuart]"
2084,16,10,Stuart McCormick,"A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. [punches him three times, the third one sending him back to Stephen. The UPS man falls to the ground and the Banes start kicking him. A woman is heard screaming. She and her husband are shown]"
2085,16,10,Man and Woman,Oh my God.
2086,16,10,Man and Woman,Come on honey! [they run off]
2087,16,10,Randy Marsh,"[whips out Ike's drawing and puts it in the man's face] Thought we wouldn't find out??? [drops it and the men scatter. Skeeter and Stephen go towards the camera and away, screen left. Stuart. Randy, and Mr. Testaburger run away from the camera, and Jimbo, Thomas, and Mr. Black run off screen right. The UPS man is left alone, battered, bruised, and coughing up blood]"
2088,16,10,Eric Cartman,[stops] Who is there?
2089,16,10,UPS Man,[opens the door and stumbles in] Please! [still gasping for air]
2090,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh?! Ohhh?! [backs away quickly. The phone rings, but Cartman goes to the kitchen to answer it] Yes? Yeah, hello?"
2091,16,10,Varashnu,"[with Indian Accent] Hello, this is Varashnu wit Wolf Home Security."
2092,16,10,Eric Cartman,A man just broke into my house and is- [looks at the phone] Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
2093,16,10,Varashnu,"...Uh yes, I am in United States."
2094,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!"
2095,16,10,Varashnu,"Okay, hold on. [transfers Cartman's call]"
2096,16,10,Eric Cartman,Heh- hello?
2097,16,10,Kevin,This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
2098,16,10,Eric Cartman,"No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!"
2099,16,10,Kevin,We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.
2100,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!"
2101,16,10,Kevin,"Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood."
2102,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!"
2103,16,10,Kevin,"I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head."
2104,16,10,Eric Cartman,Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! [slams the phone on the floor]
2105,16,10,Sgt Yates,"All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet! [the crowd quiets down] I know you're all worried about your families' security. All I can tell you is that so far, Bane has not been caught. [the people begin to murmur amongst themselves]"
2106,16,10,Mr Mackey,"Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?"
2107,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
2108,16,10,Randy Marsh,[aside to Gerald] Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
2109,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,What?
2110,16,10,Randy Marsh,Huh? Nothing.
2111,16,10,Sgt Yates,Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can. [makes way for the security agent who visited Cartman and his mom earlier]
2112,16,10,Security Agent,"Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home."
2113,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?"
2114,16,10,Spokesman,"[in a commercial] Protecting your home and your family is hard enough! But sometimes alarms on your doors and windows aren't enough! A new security system allows not only for your doors and windows to be monitored, but your fear levels as well. [a 3-D schematic of a house is shown, with a person in it] A security system that is actually inside you. It's called IN-security."
2115,16,10,Husband and Wife,[with wife and twin daughters] We'll never forget the day we took our twin daughters to the beach.
2116,16,10,Stranger,"Hehey, what cute twins."
2117,16,10,Husband and Wife,Thanks.
2118,16,10,Stranger,"They're so adorable [whips out a crowbar and assumes a menacing posture. The wife instinctively tries to protect the girls] that I'm gonna bash their fucking heads in! [the alarm goes off and the stranger runs away, dropping the crowbar. The husband receives the call]"
2119,16,10,Peter,This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
2120,16,10,Husband and Wife,A white man just tried to murder our twin girls.
2121,16,10,Peter,"I have a police car on their way with blankets and cocoa. [Next shot is of the whole family in blankets and sipping cocoa at the beach, with police cars around them and police officers investigating]"
2122,16,10,Husband and Wife,I only hope other have people have INsecurity to protect their families.
2123,16,10,Shoe Salesman,"Well, how's the shoe fit, pal?"
2124,16,10,Boy and Mom,I think it fits pretty good.
2125,16,10,Shoe Salesman,"Well okayhehe, let's see if it fits better than this KNIFE THROUGH YOUR FUCKING SKULL, BASTARD! [gets out a large knife and slashes the air with it.]"
2126,16,10,Boy and Mom,Aaahh! [jumps into his mom's arms and the alarm goes off. The salesman drops the knife and runs off. The phone rings and the mom answers it]
2127,16,10,Boy and Mom,Hello?
2128,16,10,David,This is David with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
2129,16,10,Boy and Mom,"[voice breaking] No, a while shoe salesman tried to murder my son."
2130,16,10,David,"Hold tight. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa. [next scene, mom and son are in blankets and sipping cocoa while the police investigate]"
2131,16,10,Spokesman,"Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with... [the new company logo appears, with ""Custom installation for only $99.""] INsecurity."
2132,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
2133,16,10,Stan Marsh,"You're gonna have to tell him, dude."
2134,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,I know...
2135,16,10,Eric Cartman,[runs up to them] HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! [wears a little sign on his head showing that ]
2136,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
2137,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere."
2138,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!"
2139,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, fat bitch, huh?! [gets smug] Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!"
2140,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!"
2141,16,10,Eric Cartman,"What? [his alarm goes off, then he gets the call] Hello?"
2142,16,10,Marcus,This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
2143,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity."
2144,16,10,Marcus,"All right, could I just get your password please?"
2145,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs."
2146,16,10,Marcus,I love boobs?
2147,16,10,Eric Cartman,"No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs."
2148,16,10,Marcus,How did you know that?
2149,16,10,Eric Cartman,My password is uloveboobs!
2150,16,10,Marcus,Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny.
2151,16,10,Eric Cartman,"You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!"
2152,16,10,Marcus,"Sure, here you go. [gets to resetting the system]"
2153,16,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-! [notices Kyle is gone, but looks around] Kyle? God damn it."
2154,16,10,Randy Marsh,"And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks."
2155,16,10,Stuart McCormick,"Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again."
2156,16,10,Jimbo,[bursts through the front doors] He's back!
2157,16,10,Stephen Stotch,What?!
2158,16,10,Jimbo,[runs to the bar] I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
2159,16,10,Stephen Stotch,How?
2160,16,10,Jimbo,"He casually dropped this on his way out! [whips out a sheet of paper, and the other men gather to have a look. It's Ike's drawing]"
2161,16,10,Randy Marsh,[low voice] Oh my God! [now he and the men think the UPS man has made copies of that drawing and is dropping them off at every house]
2162,16,10,Mechanic,"Didn't kill 'im, did ya? [the other men turn around] Yea', I didn't think you had it in ya."
2163,16,10,Randy Marsh,We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
2164,16,10,Mechanic,Milkman don't get scared. Not with free pussy at every doorstep.
2165,16,10,Stephen Stotch,"Son of a bitch, it's him all right!"
2166,16,10,Randy Marsh,This guy doesn't know when to quit!
2167,16,10,Stephen Stotch,"He's stopping at another house. [the UPS man stops his truck, gets down with a new package, and goes to the next house, looking around]"
2168,16,10,Mr Black,Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad.
2169,16,10,Randy Marsh,"[his INsecurity goes off] Sorry sorry, that's me. [gets the call] Hello?"
2170,16,10,Alvin,This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
2171,16,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo. [the other men glance at him] It's a joke."
2172,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet."
2173,16,10,Sheila Broflovski,"That's right, Kyle."
2174,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. [the doorbell rings and he sighs deeply, then goes to answer it. The UPS man is on the other side of the door]"
2175,16,10,UPS Man,"Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya?"
2176,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?"
2177,16,10,UPS Man,What?
2178,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Please? I need you to come sit down for a second. [puzzled, the UPS man comes in and sits down on the armchair. Kyle returns to his spot between his parents, and silence follows for a couple of seconds] So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something? [she stays quiet] Mom?"
2179,16,10,UPS Man,What's going on?
2180,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!"
2181,16,10,UPS Man,"Don't you think I want to?! [his UPS truck is shown in the background] I hate this damned town! Every day, things just keep getting weirder around here, and I'm just about sick of it![Randy and Stephen run out from behind the truck, and a few seconds later it blows up] Aaah! [runs to a window] Oh my God! [gets the call and answers it] Hello?"
2182,16,10,Brian,"This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?"
2183,16,10,UPS Man,No! They blew up my car! They blew up my car!
2184,16,10,Brian,I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.
2185,16,10,UPS Man,[goes up the stairs] They're after me again! Do something!
2186,16,10,Brian,"Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in. [switches calls] This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?"
2187,16,10,Eric Cartman,"[in the perfume section of a store, with a saleswoman behind the counter] Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne."
2188,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,[opens the front door] What the hell's goin' on out here?! [Stephen and Jimbo lie in wait for the UPS man]
2189,16,10,Jimbo,"Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!"
2190,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,"What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! [Jimbo's INsecurity goes off, his phone rings, and he answers it]"
2191,16,10,UPS Man,[trying again to call INsecurity] Somebody answer me! You have to send help now!
2192,16,10,Martin,"Sir, we are sending help. Just stay calm. [another call comes in] Hang on sir, this is Martin with INsecurity."
2193,16,10,Randy Marsh,"[on the phone] Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is."
2194,16,10,Martin,"Hello, this is Martin with INsecu-"
2195,16,10,Eric Cartman,"[outside a store] God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards![Martin is swamped with calls. Another one comes in] Hello? [his own INsecurity has gone off]"
2196,16,10,Mike,This is Mike with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
2197,16,10,UPS Man,[in the master bedroom] Hello?!
2198,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[sees the open door and goes in] Dude, come down here!"
2199,16,10,UPS Man,[panics] AAAAH! [jumps through the closed window to his death] Uf. [everyone else looks. Police arrive shortly with blankets and cocoa.]
2200,16,10,Sgt Yates,So you say this man killed himself because he was a psychopath who was forced to have sex with his mother? [holds a sheet of paper in his hand]
2201,16,10,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, we found that in his pocket. [points to the sheet, which the captain holds up. It's... Ike's drawing again]"
2202,16,10,Officer,"Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs? [It's the UPS uniform Gerald uses in roleplaying]"
2203,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yes, that's mine."
2204,16,10,Randy Marsh,Yours? What?
2205,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,[rips the uniform from the officer] Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
2206,16,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?"
2207,16,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. [all the other men's alarms go off, their phones ring, and they all answer them]"
2208,16,10,The Men,Hello?
2209,16,10,Randy Marsh,It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
2210,16,10,Mechanic,"Yea'. Got yourselves some nice home security systems, don'tcha? Payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house. Only problem is, while you're out feelin' like your things are safe, that security man is fucking your wife."
2211,16,10,Security Agent,"Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back. [the woman closes her door and the agent goes back to his van. He gets in and sits down, preparing to drive. A gun pops up next to him, and he's alarmed.] Ah! Who are you??"
2212,16,10,Eric Cartman,"[in Bane mask] It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. [the men return in Bane masks to haul the agent out and beat him up]"
2213,16,10,Security Agent,Hoo!
2214,16,11,Eric Cartman,FELLAS! Fellas!
2215,16,11,Stan Marsh,What?
2216,16,11,Eric Cartman,You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
2217,16,11,Kyle Broflovski,Butters? [He and Stan look puzzled] Why?
2218,16,11,Eric Cartman,"It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!"
2219,16,11,Stan Marsh,You're talking about Butters.
2220,16,11,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! [The other boys get concerned and leave their tables to go to the restroom]"
2221,16,11,Stan Marsh,Butters?
2222,16,11,Butters Stotch,Leave me alone!
2223,16,11,Stan Marsh,"Butters, come out here."
2224,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Get out of here, all of ya! [Stan turns to the other boys and shrugs]"
2225,16,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-"
2226,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[Runs out of the restroom up to Kyle and points at him] You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because [walks to Stan and points him out] your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image! [runs back inside the boys room, then turns around and runs to Cartman] You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up [moves over to Jimmy], and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny! [moves over to Kenny] The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! [Runs back into the restroom and locks himself in. The other boys are stunned and silent]"
2227,16,11,Eric Cartman,"Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? [Kenny flashes an angry look]"
2228,16,11,Butters Stotch,[Runs out of the restroom again and storms up to Cartman] And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! [Cartman looks stunned]Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! [Runs back into the boys restroom and locks himself in]
2229,16,11,Eric Cartman,...Wow.
2230,16,11,Butters Stotch,[Opens the door and peeks out] Double wow! [Closes the door and locks it]
2231,16,11,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse."
2232,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!"
2233,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[In a gruff voice] I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!"
2234,16,11,Linda Stotch,Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
2235,16,11,Butters Stotch,"I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!"
2236,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!"
2237,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! [Both parents look taken aback as a moment of silence follows]"
2238,16,11,Linda Stotch,"[looks at Stephen] Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
2239,16,11,Stephen Stotch,Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.
2240,16,11,Principal Victoria,Eh-excuse me?
2241,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault."
2242,16,11,Butters Stotch,It's not?!
2243,16,11,Stephen Stotch,It has to do with... biology. [turns right and walks off a bit] You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.
2244,16,11,Butters Stotch,Yeah?
2245,16,11,Stephen Stotch,You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.
2246,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[normal voice] Hey yeah, all the time."
2247,16,11,Stephen Stotch,It's because he is. [Turns around and faces Principal Victoria] His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.
2248,16,11,Principal Victoria,"Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand."
2249,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing."
2250,16,11,Linda Stotch,"I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!"
2251,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!"
2252,16,11,Linda Stotch,Then we can go with him.
2253,16,11,Stephen Stotch,You know that's not allowed!
2254,16,11,Butters Stotch,Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
2255,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa."
2256,16,11,Butters Stotch,Uhbu-but I'm from here.
2257,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters. [Walks to a bookshelf and grabs a scrapbook] A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i."
2258,16,11,Butters Stotch,We're from Hawaii?
2259,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"[Sits on the sofa next to Butters. Linda sits to his left] Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive. [Opens the book and points some pictures out to him] We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. [Flips backwards a few pages and shows him a picture of Elvis Presley playing a ukulele with a picture of Diamondhead in the background.]"
2260,16,11,Butters Stotch,But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
2261,16,11,Stephen Stotch,"Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called ""hapahui apahoha"", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone. [Linda stands up and starts crying. Stephen stands up and takes out his wallet] Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you. [He turns his back to Butters. Linda weeps silently. Butters is speechless]"
2262,16,11,Eric Cartman,"Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. [The other boys gather around him]"
2263,16,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2264,16,11,Eric Cartman,Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
2265,16,11,Stan Marsh,Hawaii?
2266,16,11,Eric Cartman,"He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut."
2267,16,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him."
2268,16,11,Stan Marsh,"[Turns to the basket] After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. [Makes a shot at close range]"
2269,16,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him."
2270,16,11,Kenny McCormick,(I'm not his best friend.)
2271,16,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. [Kenny sighs and walks away with his head down.]"
2272,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Butters, come on.)"
2273,16,11,Butters Stotch,"They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right! [Kenny takes one suitcase and Butters' right hand, Butters takes the other suitcase, and they walk. Suddenly Butters stops and pulls his hand away] No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! [Kenny sighs, then takes Butters to the teller]"
2274,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)"
2275,16,11,Teller,"I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated."
2276,16,11,Butters Stotch,"I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua!"
2277,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)"
2278,16,11,Teller,"Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go."
2279,16,11,Kenny McCormick,(Me?)
2280,16,11,Butters Stotch,Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
2281,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"[Puts his hand over Butters mouth to shut him up] (Okay, okay! I'll go.) [Scene cuts to the plane flying towards Hawaii]"
2282,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[Slowly, as he looks around] Well, we're here, now what do I do? [Kenny points to the information officer nearby, and they walk to him]"
2283,16,11,Information Officer,Can I help you with anything?
2284,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?"
2285,16,11,Information Officer,"Okay, were you with a cruise ship or land tour group?"
2286,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. [The officer just looks at him. A group of Americans approaches him]"
2287,16,11,Blond Man,Butters Stotch?
2288,16,11,Butters Stotch,Yeah?
2289,16,11,Blond Man,"Welcome home, young keiki. Your parents said you would be coming for your ceremony. [Notices Kenny] Ah- uh, who's this?"
2290,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny."
2291,16,11,Older Woman,"Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies."
2292,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come."
2293,16,11,Blond Man,"Very well, we shall speak with the chief of our island and see. Come now. [Everyone leaves]"
2294,16,11,Butters Stotch,You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
2295,16,11,Older Man,"[Driving] Yes. My wife Patty and I have been coming to Kaua'i for almost five years, and Bill and Donna actually own a time share in Poipu."
2296,16,11,Donna,"Yes, but Poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists, I'm afraid."
2297,16,11,Blond Man,"[Leans to the right, behind the older man] Let us eat."
2298,16,11,Older Man,"Oh yea, let us eat. [They stop at Kuwahara Saimin's drive-through] Aloha, five order of saimin, please."
2299,16,11,Butters Stotch,"What's ""saimin""?"
2300,16,11,Wife Patty,It's one of the foods of our people.
2301,16,11,Older Man,"Oh, I get 20% off, I'm a native. Here's my Mahalo Rewards card. [The cashier notes the card and takes the cash, the older man takes the food, and they're off.] Mahalo. [They soon find themselves behind a slow car with the passenger taking pictures of the scenery. The older man honks.] Come on, you frickin' tourist! Jesus, buy a post card! [Stops and points out a building] These are the ancient ruins of our ancestors. [It's the Coco Palms, long abandoned.] They say the spirit of the king is still in there."
2302,16,11,Blond Man,You must stay away from this place. It is kapu.
2303,16,11,Brunet Man,"Kapu. that means ""taboo"", [points to Kenny] especially to haoles! [they drive off]"
2304,16,11,Older Man,"Uh that there is Bubba's Burgers. [Scene shows Bubba's Burgers] In Havai'i us natives say ""Bubba's Bruk"". [they pass by a big hotel] Here's the Sheraton, just another megahotel for the throngs of tourists. Here's where many of us natives live. The Sheraton Residences. [A gated community is shown. The Older Man flashes his Mahalo Rewards card to the guard] It's all right, we're natives. [The guard opens the gate and lets them in. They arrive at the chief's residence and step out to talk to him] Protector and Chief, I present to you the keiki, Butters Stotch."
2305,16,11,Chief David,"Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?"
2306,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow."
2307,16,11,Stan Marsh,"[reading the letter] ""On the morrow""? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?"
2308,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth."
2309,16,11,Chief David,"In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa. [everyone cheers and and woman slips a necklace onto his neck] The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island. [a horn blower comes in with a conch shell and blows into it... badly] Now drink the chi-chi! [Patty walks over with a glass of it and gives it to Butters, who begins to drink it through a straw.]"
2310,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[turns right and coughs, then] Whoa, it's like gasoline!"
2311,16,11,Chief David,"Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away."
2312,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[Finishes the rest of the drink, then stumbles just a little bit and smiles] Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better."
2313,16,11,Chief David,"O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you-"
2314,16,11,Blond Man,"[runs in] Listen! [climbs onto a table] Listen everyone! I have terrible, horrible news!"
2315,16,11,Chief David,Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa?
2316,16,11,Blond Man,I've just come from the front office! The Mahalo Rewards card is... [chokes]
2317,16,11,Chief David,What?! What has happened? Speak!
2318,16,11,Blond Man,The Mahalo Rewards card is being eliminated! They're trying to say our points are... are... no longer going to be accepted.
2319,16,11,Chief David,[Rises from his chair and walks to his left] I knew one day it would come to this.
2320,16,11,Wife Patty,To what? What does this mean?
2321,16,11,Chief David,The haoles are trying to do away with us.
2322,16,11,Resident 1,"With no rewards program, there will be no distinction between who's a native to this island and who isn't!"
2323,16,11,Resident 2,Why can't you people respect our island? Why do you always want nore?!
2324,16,11,Chief David,"I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island! [this draws cheers from everyone]"
2325,16,11,Chief David,"[Yelling at the ship] Stop ruining our island, haoles! FIRE! [The natives fire away into the ocean. Some of the golf balls land in the water, some of them reach the ship]"
2326,16,11,First Mate,What are they doing? [The passengers are being pelted with golf balls.]
2327,16,11,Chief David,[Walks over to Butters and gives him a club] Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome!
2328,16,11,Butters Stotch,I've never done this before. [Gets into position]
2329,16,11,Chief David,It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you.
2330,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Aim... my anger! Stupid [Swings successfully] Ben Affleck! [The golf ball sails through the air and enters the bridge, smashing through the window and the captain's binoculars. The first mate shrieks] Waaah! [The captain stumbles onto a controller and breaks it with sheer momentum. The ship begins to pitch back and sink. Passengers begin to tumble towards the water. Butters is dumbfounded. The ship breaks in two]"
2331,16,11,Blond Man,Hold on! [The golf club just falls out of Butters' left hand] Hold on!
2332,16,11,Woman 1,Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
2333,16,11,Blond Man,I love you! I love you!
2334,16,11,Woman 1,No! I love you! I love you back! [The ship vanishes below the water]
2335,16,11,Announcer,This is breaking news!
2336,16,11,Anchor,"An insurrection in the Hawaiian Islands has escalated to war! After sinking a cruise ship, the natives of Kauai continue to go berserk, forcing all tourists off their island."
2337,16,11,Man 1,They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!
2338,16,11,Woman 1,Then a little boy called me a skank.
2339,16,11,Anchor,"[A picture of Barack Obama appears over his shoulder] The President says he will send the Coast Guard to take the island back, though he sympathizes, being a native Hawaiian himself. [Thinks about it for a second] Hm."
2340,16,11,Chief David,Are all the tourists gone from our island?
2341,16,11,Resident 3,All but a few who are hiding out at Duke's Restaurant. We sent Bob and Trisha Turner to smoke them out.
2342,16,11,Resident 4,What about him?
2343,16,11,Kenny McCormick,(What about me?)
2344,16,11,Resident 4,He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him!
2345,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[Jumps in front of Kenny to shield him] No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!"
2346,16,11,Chief David,"Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now."
2347,16,11,Resident 4,"Finish his ceremony?! We are at war, David! I have lived on this island for ten years. Ten years! Every July and part of August! And I can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide!"
2348,16,11,Resident 5,"He's right, David. We can't trust any tourists."
2349,16,11,Butters Stotch,"He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!"
2350,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)"
2351,16,11,Resident 6,Then let him prove himself! Trial by opahika'a!
2352,16,11,Chief David,He's only a child!
2353,16,11,Resident 4,"If he wants to be one of us, then he must face the challenge!"
2354,16,11,Chief David,"Very well. [The horn blower, Resident 5, returns to blow the conch shell]"
2355,16,11,Blond Man,This isn't right! He's not a native! He's gonna get killed!
2356,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Kenny, be careful!"
2357,16,11,Chief David,Quiet. He must face this challenge alone. [Kenny is on a surfboard on the river using a small paddle to get somewhere]
2358,16,11,Resident 1,By the gods! Perhaps he has the heart of a native after all!
2359,16,11,Resident 4,"He still has yet to make the turn! [Kenny reaches a buoy in the middle of the river and paddles around it, then makes his way back to the riverbank.]"
2360,16,11,Residents of the Hyatt Residences,Hohhh!
2361,16,11,Resident 7,"[A little tipsy from his drink] That's pretty good. [Kenny slows down, then loses his balance and falls into the river]"
2362,16,11,Kenny McCormick,(Whoops!)
2363,16,11,Butters Stotch,Kenny!
2364,16,11,Residents of the Hyatt Residences,Awwwww. [A second later they all turn away and leave. Butters stays at the riverbank.]
2365,16,11,Resident 4,[To another Resident] I told you a haole couldn't do it!
2366,16,11,Chief David,Did you make the turn your first try? Did any of us? [Kenny pops up behind them and floats down the river]
2367,16,11,Resident 8,"[A woman, walks up to Butters] Don't worry, Butters, your friend will find a way back to his kind. The gods will protect him. [She extends her left hand and guides him away]"
2368,16,11,Chief David,"We have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war, all the native Hawaiian tribes must join as one!"
2369,16,11,Resident 9,We're not joining the people of the Hyatt Grand Vacations! They have no rights to call themselves natives!
2370,16,11,Vacationer 1,Oh and you do?! Your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago! Our ancestors sailed here! On a cruise ship! Nine months ago!
2371,16,11,Chief David,"Look, if we are to fight the haoles, we have to allow all natives to stay!"
2372,16,11,Canyoner,"It doesn't matter how many tribes we have, we can't win! We are but a few against the haole's military might! We may have passion, but passion does not win wars!"
2373,16,11,Chief David,"Oh no? Come up here, keiki. Come on. [Butters gets on stage with David] This child sunk a cruise ship by himself! Tell them keiki. [Hands the mic to Butters]"
2374,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!"
2375,16,11,Resident 9,Yeah!
2376,16,11,Vacationer 1,Screw them!
2377,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!"
2378,16,11,Chief David,Let us make a pact with more chi-chis!
2379,16,11,Resident 1,"[goes to serve himself some more chi-chi from the barrels, but finds there isn't any] Um, we're... we're out of chi-chis."
2380,16,11,Resident 11,"Oh, right, we've closed off all the ports."
2381,16,11,Resident 12,"But they're still letting vodka through, right? Uh... they can't cut off our chi-chis."
2382,16,11,Chief David,...Oh my God.
2383,16,11,Captain,"This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!"
2384,16,11,Chief David,"[heading up a large group of natives] Ready? Fire! [the natives fire off their golf balls, but none of them have any effect on the Coast Guard]"
2385,16,11,Captain,"[Lowers his binoculars, then flatly] Fire. [The ships' guns fire away and decimate many of the natives]"
2386,16,11,Chief David,Arm the bocce balls! [Surviving natives arm bocce balls into slingshots stretched between palm trees. One of them lands on the main ship with a heavy thud]
2387,16,11,Captain,God damn it.
2388,16,11,Chief David,Keep fighting! Stand your ground!
2389,16,11,Resident 4,We can't fight without chi-chis!
2390,16,11,Chief David,You can and you MUST!
2391,16,11,Butters Stotch,[He has six golf balls in front of him and he hits each one towards the Coast Guard] Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
2392,16,11,The King,"Come on, come on. [Mumbles a few more things as they walk towards a door. Elvis stops and pulls a lever, and a wall rises to reveal loads of absolute vodka, pineapple juice, coconut milk, and macadamia nut liqueur, all the ingredients needed for chi-chis. Elvis walks up to the doorway and motions to Kenny] You know what chi-chis are, right?"
2393,16,11,Chief David,"Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government."
2394,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[Runs onto the plaza] Surrender?! No, the heck with that!"
2395,16,11,Resident 4,We can't hold out here any longer!
2396,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!"
2397,16,11,Chief David,"Young keiki, try to control your anger."
2398,16,11,Butters Stotch,"No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director! [Turns around and walks away] All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!"
2399,16,11,Resident 13,"Everyone! Look, I say! [Everyone comes to see, and it's Kenny coming back with a raft full of absolute vodka, pineapple juice, coconut milk, and macadamia nut liqueur. Everyone cheers him on]"
2400,16,11,Resident 14,The haole did it!
2401,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors."
2402,16,11,Chief David,We are not surrendering today! Go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end! [Everyone cheers]
2403,16,11,Captain,"You people just don't give up, do ya?"
2404,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace."
2405,16,11,Kenny McCormick,"With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again."
2406,16,11,Chief David,"And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys. [Two women come up and give them their cards] Apuiloa hapnanoaha! Hapa'a'a hohaaa! [Resident 5 returns to blow the conch shell a third time.] It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest?"
2407,16,11,Butters Stotch,"[He thinks for a moment] Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez."
2408,16,11,Resident 15,"Ben Affleck isn't with Jennifer Lopez anymore, he's married to Jennifer Gardner."
2409,16,11,Residents of the Hyatt Residences,"Yeah, it's true, uh huh."
2410,16,11,Butters Stotch,"What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. [smiles with relief]"
2411,16,11,Kenny McCormick,(You do?)
2412,16,11,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology. [He and Kenny walk off into the sunset] Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!"
2413,16,12,Randy Marsh,[excitedly] Hellooo family! [closes the door] Who wants champagne? [puts the gifts on the sofa]
2414,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"[meeting him at the sofa] Randy, what is all this? [Stan and Shelly follow]"
2415,16,12,Randy Marsh,"It's finally happened, Sharon! [makes to fists and draws them to his chest] I did it! [raises his fists up and lowers them quickly, then opens the gifts. He gives the first one to Sharon] Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous."
2416,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"[happily] Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!"
2417,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[proudly] And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now."
2418,16,12,Stan Marsh,[gets his gift] We're rich?
2419,16,12,Shelly Marsh,[gets her gift] Finally.
2420,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, are you being serious? [smiles]"
2421,16,12,Randy Marsh,I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! [Sharon frowns]
2422,16,12,Stan Marsh,[somewhat confused] Blockbuster Video?
2423,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?"
2424,16,12,Randy Marsh,"You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition."
2425,16,12,Sharon Marsh,I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
2426,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?"
2427,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. [they reach their destination and exit the car, and have a look at the place]"
2428,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Well? There she is. [a building in the middle of a parking lot, looking nice, but silent.] It's a new beginning for us! [takes out the key to the building and goes to the front doors to open the store up. The others follow.]"
2429,16,12,Shelly Marsh,[staying by the car] I don't wanna go in there.
2430,16,12,Randy Marsh,Shelly come on!
2431,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Can you believe it? Completely turnkey! [walks towards the shelves while his family stays by the front doors.] Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD! [returns] Well, what do you think?"
2432,16,12,Stan Marsh,It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
2433,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it."
2434,16,12,Sharon Marsh,I didn't say anything.
2435,16,12,Randy Marsh,"You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS."
2436,16,12,Randy Marsh,"How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?"
2437,16,12,Shelly Marsh,"Six. [picks up another DVD from a stack] We still, have, SIX. [turns and puts it on a shelf with more copies of the DVD]"
2438,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly."
2439,16,12,Boy,"Go get it, Fillmore! [the boys are on a low cliff across the street.]"
2440,16,12,Fillmore and friend,"No way, I ain't goin' neer that place. Yeeeyou go get it. [they panic as the front door opens. Randy picks up the ball and sees them]"
2441,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?"
2442,16,12,Boy,What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee?
2443,16,12,Randy Marsh,[annoyed] Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore! [raises his arms as if to grab something] People just don't know we're open yet!
2444,16,12,Fillmore and Friend,AAAAAH! [turn right and run off]
2445,16,12,Randy Marsh,[throws the ball back across the street.] Little fucking pricks. [goes back inside and closes the door.]
2446,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Hello, welcome to Blockbuster! [the shopper looks through the TV series boxed sets] Can I help you find something?"
2447,16,12,Shopper,I can't find... [turns her head to face Randy] Turner & Hooch. [turns back to the videos] Where's Turner & Hooch?
2448,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-"
2449,16,12,Shopper,Aahh... [her voice echoes as she dissolves into thin air]
2450,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[stunned, then annoyed] Oh. Oh I get it! [looks heavenward] Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!"
2451,16,12,Ghost,"[floats by] Emily? [turns into the aisle where the woman was] Emily, the war is over! Let's go rent a movie at Blockbuster!"
2452,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!"
2453,16,12,Ghost,"The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now! [floats past Randy]"
2454,16,12,Randy Marsh,"I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!"
2455,16,12,Ghost,"[turns around and looks at Randy] The hounds, Emily! The hounds!"
2456,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy! [sticks his tongue out and makes noises at him] ""Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!"" [Stan, who doesn't see the ghost, watches from a distance] Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!"
2457,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[turns and walks to Sharon, who's at the counter looking up things on the ancient CRT monitor] I think something might be wrong with Dad?"
2458,16,12,Sharon Marsh,Ya think? [Stan glances up at her]
2459,16,12,Butters Stotch,Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
2460,16,12,Eric Cartman,We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
2461,16,12,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
2462,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?"
2463,16,12,Butters Stotch,"I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style."
2464,16,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style. [grins]"
2465,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure."
2466,16,12,Butters Stotch,Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
2467,16,12,Eric Cartman,[walks off with Kenny] You'll just have to wait and see.
2468,16,12,Sharon Marsh,I think that's good. Feel tight enough?
2469,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom."
2470,16,12,Sharon Marsh,Let's see the shield.
2471,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[takes up the shield and strikes a pose] Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!"
2472,16,12,Sharon Marsh,[claps] Yehay!
2473,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[arrives] Hey, whoa, what are you doing?"
2474,16,12,Sharon Marsh,Stan's about to go out with his friends.
2475,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Nono, I need everybody tonight! [Stan loses his enthusiasm] It's our big night!"
2476,16,12,Sharon Marsh,For what?!
2477,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!"
2478,16,12,Shelly Marsh,God I hate this family!
2479,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, let him go trick-or-treating."
2480,16,12,Randy Marsh,[walks over to some end display] You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing [a cauldron full of them] and candy corn [in a display case]. This is the night we turn it all around.
2481,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[disappointed] Dad, nobody's gonna come."
2482,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!"
2483,16,12,Stan Marsh,Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
2484,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Ew! [turns right and walks away] That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!"
2485,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[moments later, on the land line] I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!"
2486,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[dressed as Thor, in his living room] Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?"
2487,16,12,Stan Marsh,"I know, but there's nothing I can do."
2488,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,But what about the costume contest?!
2489,16,12,Kenny McCormick,"[dressed as Iron Man, comes in from the kitchen] What's going on, Kyle?"
2490,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan can't come.
2491,16,12,Eric Cartman,"[dressed as Hulk, comes in from the kitchen] Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!"
2492,16,12,Stan Marsh,I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
2493,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
2494,16,12,Stan Marsh,"No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him."
2495,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[appears from an aisle] Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! [goes back into the aisle]"
2496,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh never mind, I hate him again."
2497,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?"
2498,16,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2499,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea."
2500,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?"
2501,16,12,Stan Marsh,"How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home."
2502,16,12,Eric Cartman,"This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!"
2503,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,He looks fine.
2504,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house."
2505,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" [they head for a house to their left. Kenny rings the bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]"
2506,16,12,The Boys,Trick or treat.
2507,16,12,Stan Marsh,Trick or treat.
2508,16,12,Man 1,"Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. [Each of the boys (except Stan) make a pose when their respective costumes are said]"
2509,16,12,Eric Cartman,[dropping his pose] I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
2510,16,12,Man 1,"Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh [snaps his fingers] oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... [puts his left hand to his head]"
2511,16,12,Eric Cartman,The Incredible...
2512,16,12,Man 1,"Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?"
2513,16,12,Woman 1,"[raises her palms up, then rests them on her legs] Ohhh, cute!"
2514,16,12,Eric Cartman,No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
2515,16,12,Woman 1,[quick gasp] The incredible Harvey Fierstein?
2516,16,12,Man 1,"Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green."
2517,16,12,Eric Cartman,"The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!"
2518,16,12,Man 1,The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
2519,16,12,Eric Cartman,[loses his cool and shuts his eyes] JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY! [moments later they're on to the next house] It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! [Kenny rings the door bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]
2520,16,12,Kenny McCormick,Trick or treat.
2521,16,12,Man 2,"Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!"
2522,16,12,Eric Cartman,That's right!
2523,16,12,Man 2,"Oho, and Honey Boo Boo! [Cartman glares at him. The man looks back inside the house] Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume!"
2524,16,12,Girlfriend,"Oh, it's getting colder out."
2525,16,12,Boyfriend,"Yeah, you can definitely tell that winter's coming. [the woman glances to her right, then turns her head to the right. They both stop walking] What's the matter?"
2526,16,12,Girlfriend,"That old creepy place. I saw someone in the window there. [as they look, Randy appears at one of the windows and beckons them to come in. Then he holds up a HALF OFF sign and shakes it a bit]"
2527,16,12,Boyfriend,"Come on, let's get out of here. [puts his arm around her shoulders. They hurry off.]"
2528,16,12,Randy Marsh,[sighs and throws down the sign in frustration] They'll come! [walks off slowly and his voice gets deeper] Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
2529,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[closes his eyes and sobs a bit] Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?! [uncovers his eyes and moves his palms down to his cheeks] It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies! [places his hands on the counter] What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple. [notices something and pounds the glass] Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!"
2530,16,12,Ghost 2,"[a former Blockbuster employee] Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be?"
2531,16,12,Randy Marsh,I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
2532,16,12,Ghost 2,Coming right up. [goes to retrieve the videos]
2533,16,12,Randy Marsh,"No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak."
2534,16,12,Ghost 2,"[types in the order] Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs?"
2535,16,12,Randy Marsh,He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
2536,16,12,Ghost 2,"If I may say so, Mr. Marsh, your Blockbuster will never get any customers with those two Negative Nancys sabotaging you. You may need to do something... rather extreme. [more sinister] If I may say so, Mr. Marsh. [Randy looks at him, then at Stan, who is off in a corner looking at his iPad.]"
2537,16,12,Stan Marsh,Trick or treat.
2538,16,12,Ghost 2,"You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh. [Randy feels the pressure and resists it] You must be willing to do anything."
2539,16,12,Randy Marsh,No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy! [notices Stan looking at him] Hey Stan. [turns and walks away]
2540,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-"
2541,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Dude dude dude! Check it out. [points to something across the street... a robbery in progress. One robber is outside a Kum & Go minimart. He breaks a surveillance camera with a crowbar, then jimmies the door open and goes in]"
2542,16,12,Stan Marsh,What? What's he doing?
2543,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
2544,16,12,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] You guys, we've gotta stop it!"
2545,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,[turns around] Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
2546,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, where did you guys go?"
2547,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns his skateboard around] Oh, sorry dude."
2548,16,12,Stan Marsh,"All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!"
2549,16,12,Kenny McCormick,"Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side."
2550,16,12,Eric Cartman,Cartman SMASH! [they turn around and go into action]
2551,16,12,Robber 1,"All right, the camera's out. Hurry up, you two! [the other two robbers are trying to break into a Red Box rental box. They succeed, and some change falls out]"
2552,16,12,Robber 2,What the? You told me these things were full of money!
2553,16,12,Robber 3,"It's Halloween. I thought everyone would be renting spooky movies. [the boys break into the store, with Cartman acting like a rampaging Hulk]"
2554,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,[holds up his sledge hammer] For Odin! For Asgard!
2555,16,12,Robber 4,Who are you?!
2556,16,12,Eric Cartman,"[roars some more, then] Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind. [walks to the counter and sees a dead clerk slumped over the counter] Holy shit, they shot this guy."
2557,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God!
2558,16,12,Kenny McCormick,"Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! [the boys head out the front door with the robbers in hot pursuit]"
2559,16,12,Robber 4,Get 'em!
2560,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable. [Randy rises up from behind the bargain bin] No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in? [Randy slides to his right and out of view] You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home. [Randy appears from the right side of the store, way in the back, then disappears again] No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really? [Randy reappears from the left side of the store, right behind Sharon] Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen. [covers the mic and turns to Randy] Can I help you with something?"
2561,16,12,Randy Marsh,"[in a deep falsetto] According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. [they look at each other for a few seconds]"
2562,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"[goes back to her phone call] Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy. [Randy turns around and leaves] Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know."
2563,16,12,Robber 1,God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away!
2564,16,12,Robber 3,"It was the Avengers, Brad! [Robber 2 appears at a doorway]"
2565,16,12,Robber 2,"Hey, we caught one of them. We got him tied up in the back. [hurries to the back, and the other two follow him]"
2566,16,12,Robber 1,"All right, who were your friends?"
2567,16,12,Stan Marsh,Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
2568,16,12,Robber 2,He's lying. They saw everything!
2569,16,12,Robber 1,Let's try this again. [takes out a switchblade and walks up to the iPad]
2570,16,12,Stan Marsh,"No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad! [the robber scratches the glass, leaving a deep gash] Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt"
2571,16,12,Robber 4,"Hey, one of them dropped this. [a flier] It's an invitation to a Monster Mash at the community center."
2572,16,12,Stan Marsh,No no! We weren't gonna go there!
2573,16,12,Robber 1,[puts away the switchblade and backs off] Sure you weren't! [walks away] Get rid of him!
2574,16,12,Stan Marsh,"NO! [shakes his head] I won't say anything, I promise! [Robbers 2 and 3 take the iPad out to the car]"
2575,16,12,Stan Marsh,What are you gonna do? [Robber 3 takes the iPad out and carries it away] Please! Please just let me go! No!
2576,16,12,Robber 3,"Sorry, kid. End of the line. [throws the iPad into a ditch next to the road. The two robbers get back into the car and drive away]"
2577,16,12,Stan Marsh,What the hell? [gets off the stool and walks over to Shelly] Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
2578,16,12,Shelly Marsh,"[hurriedly and worriedly looking through her duffel bag and back park] I can't find it, Somebody took it!"
2579,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"[coming in from outside the store] All right Randy, where are the car keys?! [gets no answer] Randy, where are the keys to the car?! [still gets no answer. Randy is transfixed] God damn it! [walks away in a huff]"
2580,16,12,Boyfriend,Did you have fun at the Halloween party?
2581,16,12,Girlfriend,"I did. Thanks so much, Ben. And thanks for walking me home. [she notices something off to her right and stops]"
2582,16,12,Ben and girlfriend,[the boyfriend] What's the matter?
2583,16,12,Girlfriend,What is that? [lets go and walks towards the item]
2584,16,12,Ben and girlfriend,Whaht is what?
2585,16,12,Girlfriend,"[stops by the iPad] Somebody dumped a... Oh my God, Ben, it's a little boy! [picks up the iPad, which has Stan back onscreen] Hello? [wipes the screen clean] Are you okay? Little boy?[the screen brightens up]"
2586,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?"
2587,16,12,Girlfriend,It's okay. Try and stay calm.
2588,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, ah thank God you found me."
2589,16,12,Ben and girlfriend,What is he doing way out here?
2590,16,12,Stan Marsh,You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! [Ben and his girl look at each other]
2591,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend."
2592,16,12,Sgt Yates,Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
2593,16,12,Eric Cartman,Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
2594,16,12,Sgt Yates,Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
2595,16,12,Officer,"Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything."
2596,16,12,Stan Marsh,They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
2597,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan! [leads the other Avengers and the police into Stan's hospital room]
2598,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Guys, you're okay!"
2599,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,What happened to you?
2600,16,12,Stan Marsh,"It's all right, just a scratch."
2601,16,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!"
2602,16,12,Stan Marsh,"No! They're looking for you there! [to Sgt. Yates] Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash."
2603,16,12,Sgt Yates,"What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!"
2604,16,12,Officer 2,The Monster Mash is only on Halloween. [another officer quickly shushes him]
2605,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!"
2606,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, people are gonna get hurt."
2607,16,12,Sgt Yates,How many people at the Monster Mash?
2608,16,12,Officer 3,"Most of the town, sir. It's a graveyard smash."
2609,16,12,Officer 4,"Look, whatever we do, we'd better hurry. It gets on in a flash."
2610,16,12,Sgt Yates,You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
2611,16,12,Kenny McCormick,Yes. We saw their faces.
2612,16,12,Sgt Yates,All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
2613,16,12,Butters Stotch,"That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf. [a giant stops by] Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!"
2614,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover."
2615,16,12,Butters Stotch,"Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. [Gangnamstein turns left and runs into a man]"
2616,16,12,Stan Marsh,Oops.
2617,16,12,Man 3,Gaaah!
2618,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, be careful in there."
2619,16,12,Officer 3,[side the Gangnamstein outfit] Sorry. I can't see a thing in here.
2620,16,12,Stan Marsh,"It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps."
2621,16,12,A Banana,"Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that."
2622,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING! [notices a video and stops] Oh look, Wedding Crashers. [takes it and carries it around, then notices Shelly and stops] What are you doing, Shelly?"
2623,16,12,Shelly Marsh,"[sprays some lighter fluid onto some DVDs on a rack, then lights a match] Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. [tosses the match onto the floor]"
2624,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Okay. [walks on] STAN! [Shelly squeezes some more lighter fluid onto the racks, which quickly go up in flames.] STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!"
2625,16,12,Mr Mackey,"Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay."
2626,16,12,Stan Marsh,Wait a minute. There they are!
2627,16,12,Mr Garrison,[turns around] There's who? [the four robbers are shown]
2628,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- [some rustling is heard and Randy takes Stan's iPad from him]"
2629,16,12,Randy Marsh,Who are you people?! You aren't real!
2630,16,12,Officer 3,"Hey hay, I can't see! Where do I go? [begins to walk blindly, and the transformation to Gangnamstein is complete]"
2631,16,12,Randy Marsh,Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All! [everyone begins to run out of the community center.] I got a little somethin' for all of you! [takes a golf club from a golfer and starts swinging it around] Run! You'd better run!
2632,16,12,Randy Marsh,Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
2633,16,12,Family,HAAAAA! [they get off their sofa and run]
2634,16,12,Randy Marsh,Haarrrr! [walks forward]
2635,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Raaaawr! [falls to the floor, but gets up again]"
2636,16,12,Boys,AAAAA!
2637,16,12,Randy Marsh,Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!
2638,16,12,Boys,"[get off the bed and run] AAAAA! [run out of the house, with Gangnamstein behind them] AAAAA!"
2639,16,12,Randy Marsh,AAAAA! [a spotlight shines on Kyle's iPad] AAAAA! [Gangnamstein raises its arms to shield itself from the light. Yates and his officers have arrived and are ready to shoot]
2640,16,12,Sgt Yates,FIRE! [the officers fire away]
2641,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Arrrg! [looks to his left] Hey, what are you doing?!"
2642,16,12,Stan Marsh,"[gaining control of his own iPad] It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! [Officer 3 takes the iPad off and throws it away while he keeps getting shot, and finally falls over dead. The gunfire stops]"
2643,16,12,Sgt Yates,We got the sonofabitch!
2644,16,12,Officer 5,"Wait, wasn't that Peterson in there? [Officer 2 shushes him quickly]"
2645,16,12,Sgt Yates,"Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay."
2646,16,12,Robber 1,Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't.
2647,16,12,Butters Stotch,Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. [Kyle knows what this means and walks over to his iPad]
2648,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan?
2649,16,12,Stan Marsh,Hey dude.
2650,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it. [the low battery indicator pops up - 5% remaining] Oh God. [turns to the gathering crowd] SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER! [turns back to Stan] Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
2651,16,12,Stan Marsh,"It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK. [Kyle does so, and the indicator disappears] You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me."
2652,16,12,Kyle Broflovski,You're gonna see it. [to the crowd] WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
2653,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?"
2654,16,12,Kenny McCormick,"Yeah, Stan?"
2655,16,12,Stan Marsh,"Stay gold. [the iPad runs out of juice and the screen goes black, except for some symbols indicating the iPad needs to be recharged. Cartman roars like Hulk.]"
2656,16,12,Randy Marsh,"Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan! [mumbles incoherently again, waving the videos he took with him in anger] Stan! [finally collapses into a snowdrift]"
2657,16,12,Sharon Marsh,"I spoke with the insurance company. [the destroyed Blockbuster is shown] They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?"
2658,16,12,Randy Marsh,[through frozen lips] No...
2659,16,12,Sharon Marsh,You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
2660,16,12,Randy Marsh,Yeah...
2661,16,12,Sharon Marsh,You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
2662,16,12,Randy Marsh,Okay...
2663,16,12,Sharon Marsh,What do you want from McDonald's?
2664,16,12,Randy Marsh,Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. [Sharon and the kids turn and walk away. Presumably Sharon has the car keys now. Stan returns and replaces the videos Randy has in his hand with the same movies on his iPad]
2665,16,13,Pharmacist,"Next please. [one man gets off a stool and leaves, and another one steps up and sits in it] You are sure you want to do this?"
2666,16,13,Man 1 and Man 2,Of course I'm sure!
2667,16,13,Pharmacist,"[gets out some scissors and motions to the man] Okay, roll up your sleeve. [the man rolls up his sleeve as if he's going to receive a flu shot. The nurse sees the yellow bracelet the man is wearing and cuts it off, then puts it into a small tray to her right. The man looks a bit relieved]"
2668,16,13,Eric Cartman,[upset] I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
2669,16,13,Clyde Donovan,"Lying jerk! [hops off the stool and leaves. Mr. Mackey steps up and sits down on the stool, sobbing]"
2670,16,13,Pharmacist,[snipping off the wristband] Hold still please.
2671,16,13,Mr Mackey,"[stands up and turns to leave] I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! [walks away still sobbing]"
2672,16,13,Eric Cartman,"All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?! [begins to roll up his sleeve, but then] Oh, hold on. [takes off his jacket and lets it drop to the floor] Aah, let's see... that one. [the same yellow one the others are having cut off. She cuts that one off] Stupid fraud! [spits onto the band] Good riddance to YOU! [picks up his coat and puts it on, walks off, and another man replaces him. The pharmacists adds Cartman's wrist band onto the others]"
2673,16,13,Man 1 and Man 2,"All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me! [the pharmacist does so.]"
2674,16,13,Kyle Broflovski,Did you do it?
2675,16,13,Eric Cartman,"Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!"
2676,16,13,Kenny McCormick,(I told you it was a bad idea.)
2677,16,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?! [Stan sighs and steps forward, turns right and walks away] What's wrong with him?"
2678,16,13,Randy Marsh,Oh I feel like such an idiot.
2679,16,13,Stan Marsh,"It's all right, Dad."
2680,16,13,Randy Marsh,"But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney! [turns on the TV and raises the volume] There's even more coming out about it today."
2681,16,13,Anchor,"These latest tests are once again confirming that the performance-enhancing drug HGH was in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. All over the country people are having their ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristbands cut off. It was just last week a team of scientists found traces of HGH on the Shroud of Turin [actual footage of a corner of the shroud being analyzed is shown] , along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers. [some lab testing is shown, then a panel of scientists addresses the issue]"
2682,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high."
2683,16,13,Randy Marsh,All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
2684,16,13,Anchor,"Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper. [a painter is shown painting over part of Jesus' head. Next, Benedict XVI is shown speaking to the crowds at St. Peter's Basilica. The subs say ""It's really a shame that Christ had to bring this embarrassment onto the church. We cannot tolerate any deity who used illegal substances to perform his miracles.""]"
2685,16,13,Randy Marsh,"I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. [Stan lowers his head and walks away. He goes upstairs to his room, enters and closes the door, and sits at his desk. He rolls up his left sleeve and gazes at his WWJD bracelet. He sighs heavily.]"
2686,16,13,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?"""
2687,16,13,Eric Cartman,Uh huh.
2688,16,13,Butters Stotch,"And he says, ""Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."""
2689,16,13,Eric Cartman,"So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times. [reaches his locker and opens it, then notices Stan. Butters walks over to Craig and another boy.] Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet!"
2690,16,13,Stan Marsh,"All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop."
2691,16,13,Eric Cartman,"The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!"
2692,16,13,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?"
2693,16,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah I know.
2694,16,13,Eric Cartman,"Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!"
2695,16,13,Mr Mackey,[walks by in a zombie-like fashion] Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?
2696,16,13,Craig Tucker,"Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet."
2697,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal."
2698,16,13,Announcer,It's the Charlie Rose show. Here's Chuck.
2699,16,13,Charlie Rose,"We are here tonight with the only person in America who still wears his ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristband. Please welcome Stan Marsh."
2700,16,13,A Voice,Dick! [Stan looks around]
2701,16,13,Charlie Rose,"Stan, after everything that's come out, after all the facts have been proven, why do you still wear the wristband?"
2702,16,13,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, [looks at his wristband] I just like it."
2703,16,13,Charlie Rose,You just like it.
2704,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off."
2705,16,13,Charlie Rose,"Well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristband is doing all of society a disservice. Chris Martin you say that Stan Marsh is... a dick?"
2706,16,13,Chris Martin,"Yeah, yeah, thanks Charlie. My problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth! Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that's fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus's name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud! Wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone!"
2707,16,13,Charlie Rose,"What do you say about that, Stan?"
2708,16,13,Stan Marsh,...I don't know. [checks his wristband again] I like it.
2709,16,13,Charlie Rose,"All right, well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with Stan Marsh, and thinks he's doing the right thing. Please welcome a retarded fish. [the fish, wearing a cycling helmet, babbles in the water] Now, Retarded Fish, you don't see any problem at all with someone keeping their bracelet [the fish babbles some more]"
2710,16,13,Chris Martin,"That that's because, that's because you're a retarded fish, and you don't know any better! What about the Crusades?! The Inquisitions?! How many people were tortured to death for somebody who is a fake?! [the retarded fish lets out a short ""blat""]"
2711,16,13,Charlie Rose,"What about the Crusades, Stan? Soes that enter into your decision at all?"
2712,16,13,Stan Marsh,"No, I just, I don' know. No."
2713,16,13,Charlie Rose,"Anything to add, Retarded Fish?"
2714,16,13,Retarded Fish,"Nnno, No, I'm good. Thank you."
2715,16,13,Mr Mackey,"Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you? [Stan stops as Mr. Mackey approaches him] Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?"
2716,16,13,Stan Marsh,I have?
2717,16,13,Mr Mackey,"Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me."
2718,16,13,Stan Marsh,You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
2719,16,13,Mr Mackey,Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it. [Butters walks by] Hey Butters. Stand ground.
2720,16,13,Butters Stotch,"[turns around and lift up his right arm] Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! [Stan is surprised to see Butters with a brown bracelet. Butters turns around and walks to his locker]"
2721,16,13,Mr Mackey,"Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? [walks away. Stan walks over to Butters]"
2722,16,13,Stan Marsh,"You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?"
2723,16,13,Butters Stotch,Well yeah. [points to it with his left hand] It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. [switches folders]
2724,16,13,Stan Marsh,...Farmers in where?
2725,16,13,Farmer and Worker,"Move aside, farmers! This land is no longer yours!"
2726,16,13,Farmer and Worker,We will not move aside! We will stand our ground! [shows off his bracelet] Like the child on the Charlie Rose show! [the other farmers cheer him on]
2727,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?"
2728,16,13,Butters Stotch,I donno. I got mine down at 7-11. [takes Stan down to the store] See? Right here. [a small rotating stand stocked with Stanground Bracelets is shown]
2729,16,13,Clerk,"Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you! [lifts up his right arm to show off his bracelet] Stanground, brah!"
2730,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, this is happening so fast."
2731,16,13,Steve Nelson,"Hello Stan, Steve Nelson with Endorsement Management. Are you ready for your Nike commercial? [looks at Butters, who smiles back at him]"
2732,16,13,Stan Marsh,"[looking out over a river from a stone bridge] My friends told me I was crazy, [jogging down a sidewalk in a Nike jogging suit] that I was wasting my time. [holding court at a press conference. Cameras all around him take pictures] But my cause is to stand my ground. [sits in a park, then stands up as the sun sets] When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand... [faces the sun and raises his left arm, still wearing the bracelet. It begins to glow] for standing."
2733,16,13,Waiter,Would you like to be seated?
2734,16,13,Stan Marsh,No thanks. I'll stand.
2735,16,13,Moviegoer,"Hey, you wanna siddown?"
2736,16,13,Stan Marsh,I'm good.
2737,16,13,Flight Attendant,"Sir, the captain has asked everyone to take their seats."
2738,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Tell the captain to take off. [At the gym] People ask me, ""You never took the bracelet off? Not once?"" [outside, with a sunset behind him] No. Never. Not. Ever. [Three phrases pop up onscreen: ""STAN for something. STAN up. STAN ground.""] What do I do? I Stan ground. [a double swoosh appears onscreen]"
2739,16,13,Mr Garrison,"Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-? [a classroom door flies open and a bunch of men pour in. Among them is the lead scientist on the Shroud of Turin.]"
2740,16,13,Lawyer,"Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet."
2741,16,13,Stan Marsh,For what?
2742,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh."
2743,16,13,Kyle Broflovski,What are you people talking about?
2744,16,13,Field Reporter,"Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together."
2745,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,Please let us check your wristband for superglue.
2746,16,13,Stan Marsh,No! This is stupid!
2747,16,13,Butters Stotch,He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
2748,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"Are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet, Mr. Marsh?"
2749,16,13,Stan Marsh,No! I never cut if off!
2750,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"Then, let us ah-see it."
2751,16,13,Jimmy Valmer,[pounding his desk with his fist] This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
2752,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige."
2753,16,13,Butters Stotch,Who?
2754,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"All right, it was Craig. [another scientist steps aside to show Craig]"
2755,16,13,Eric Cartman,Craig?! You asshole!
2756,16,13,Stan Marsh,"What's the big idea, Craig?!"
2757,16,13,Craig Tucker,"It just looked like you cut it off, that's all."
2758,16,13,Stan Marsh,You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
2759,16,13,Butters Stotch,"Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!"
2760,16,13,The Class,Yeah!
2761,16,13,Stan Marsh,"You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!"
2762,16,13,Butters Stotch,Go Stan!
2763,16,13,Stan Marsh,"And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!"
2764,16,13,Butters Stotch,"...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!"
2765,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!"
2766,16,13,The Class,Yeah!
2767,16,13,Butters Stotch,Prostitute!
2768,16,13,Announcer,This is breaking news.
2769,16,13,Anchor,"The tests are done and the results are in. The little boy who claimed he never cut off his ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet did cut it off, and lied about it."
2770,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"Not only did we find traces of ah-superglue, but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well. This is a dark ah-day for honest French-Swedish people everywheure."
2771,16,13,Anchor,"Though the tests seem conclusive, Stan Marsh continues to deny any cheating."
2772,16,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah. [the door opens and Kyle enters]
2773,16,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you."
2774,16,13,Stan Marsh,Thanks Kyle.
2775,16,13,Kyle Broflovski,You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
2776,16,13,Stan Marsh,Why does it matter?!
2777,16,13,Kyle Broflovski,Because you kind of made it matter.
2778,16,13,Stan Marsh,"You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!"
2779,16,13,Kyle Broflovski,S-so you did superglue it.
2780,16,13,Stan Marsh,"[hops off his bed and walks over to his desk] Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!"
2781,16,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this."
2782,16,13,Stan Marsh,"You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?! [Kyle looks around at all the Nike merchandise] This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!"
2783,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"Would you mind getting me some water, darling?"
2784,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,Can't you see I'm trying to do ah-my calisthenics?
2785,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"But my throat is parched, dear, and I'm so scared of burglars."
2786,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"[stops and turns towards the bedroom door] Is ah-tap water going to be okay, or do you want me to go down to Crystal Geyser and bring Her Highness some right from the spring?"
2787,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"Tap is fine, dear. [the scientist leaves]"
2788,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,What was that? I could have sworn I saw something outside.
2789,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,It's ah-your imagination
2790,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"[moments later] Oh darling, could you change the channel for me? The remote is dead. [the scientist glares at her, sighs heavily and goes to the TV, which is set to a show on the Jewelry & Gold Shopping Network]"
2791,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,[feeling bossed around] You just want me to change the channel or should I go and make a TV program written ah-just for you?!
2792,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"No, just change to channel 10, thanks."
2793,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,It's ah-starting to feel like ah-The Carole Burnett Show in here. [clicks through the channels]
2794,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,What was that?! I think somebody's here!
2795,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,[back to his squats] Maybe it's ah-the peepee fairy so somebody can ah-take a peepee for you too.
2796,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,Please I'm terrified. Please go check it out. [the scientist again sighs heavily and leaves the room]
2797,16,13,Stan Marsh,Jesus!
2798,16,13,Jesus Christ,Shhhh.
2799,16,13,Stan Marsh,What are you doing here?
2800,16,13,Jesus Christ,"My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use..."
2801,16,13,Stan and Jesus,...to discredit him too.
2802,16,13,Jesus Christ,That's what I'm doing. [the lights come on]
2803,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"Oh, it's ah-Tweedle Dumb and ah-Tweedle Dee trying to break in-ah-to my house!"
2804,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?"
2805,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son."
2806,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that."
2807,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"Ah-excuse me, I'm sorry to intrude, but do you want to please ah-leave or should I make you some kofel bread and ah-sausages?!"
2808,16,13,Stan Marsh,It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
2809,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Yeah, I know how it goes."
2810,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair."
2811,16,13,Jesus Christ,"I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud."
2812,16,13,Lead Scientist and Wife,"[returns in a maid outfit over his pajamas] Here you go, kofel bread and some sausage for you."
2813,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Thanks a lot. [the scientist turns around and leaves.] Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?"
2814,16,13,Jesus Christ,"NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?"
2815,16,13,Stan Marsh,"NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue."
2816,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Pff, I know, right?"
2817,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Pff it's like, that's here [puts his hand up, palm down, about two inches above the bread] and..."
2818,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. [briefly raises his left hand, palm down, to about six inches above Stan's head]"
2819,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!"
2820,16,13,Jesus Christ,"P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?"
2821,16,13,Stan Marsh,Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
2822,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!"
2823,16,13,Stan Marsh,How can we raise awareness?
2824,16,13,Jesus Christ,We need to get some bracelets.
2825,16,13,P F Pityef,"Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service?"
2826,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets..."
2827,16,13,P F Pityef,"Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be?"
2828,16,13,Stan Marsh,Our... scause?
2829,16,13,P F Pityef,Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs.
2830,16,13,Jesus Christ,I'm confused.
2831,16,13,P F Pityef,"Hm. Perhaps I should start from the beginning. [Stan and Jesus look at each other. What follows is a montage of Seussian animation elaborating on the poem below]

In the modern age there are those who believe
That a cause is a thing to be worn on one's sleeve. [the time frame here is the 1920s, based on the style of dress. everyone has their arms raised to show off their scauses]
And so, we sell a cause. It's called a scause.
And wearing a scause gets you lots of applause. [opens some doors to show some clapping machines]
We start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpist
Then dip it in colors that show off your purpose.
There are green scauses for recycling, blue scauses for kitties, [Animal Rights]
And pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties. [Breast Cancer]
Do you hate abortion? Ah! Then a white scause is for you! [Pro Life]
Why not champion your scause with some sparkles and glue?
We make scauses for this! We make scauses for that! [Chilean Miners, then Save The Dolphins, then Stop Water Pollution]
Why there's even a scause for just being fat! [Test Subject, with a Tree Hugger on the side]
What's the matter? Can't think of a scause? [talking to Jesus]
How about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozz?
Let's just think of the thing that you care about most. [talking to Stan, so Belarus]
Then let's make it orange, like marmalade toast!
And now I'd like to say ""thank you"" for your coming down.
I'm off to go sell these in your little town!"
2832,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, the hell just happen?"
2833,16,13,Mr Mackey,"Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter. [the group he addresses includes Red, Bebe, Butters, Jimmy, Craig, and Clyde] You probably all noticed my orange wristband [shows it off], mkay? It's to show my solidarity with the people of Belarus. [Stan is at his locker and notices, then turns toward the locker and smiles to himself] Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to-"
2834,16,13,Craig Tucker,"We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. [the kids raise their arms to prove it]"
2835,16,13,Mr Mackey,"Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay. [sees another group of kids and goes towards it] Uh hey kids. Kids over here..."
2836,16,13,Eric Cartman,"[meets the first group] Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?"
2837,16,13,Clyde Donovan,There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
2838,16,13,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!"
2839,16,13,Clyde Donovan,Yes you do. [tugs on the yellow wristband]
2840,16,13,Eric Cartman,"...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh."
2841,16,13,Butters Stotch,"[approaches Stan] Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers."
2842,16,13,Stan Marsh,People are saying that? [pleased]
2843,16,13,Butters Stotch,Yeeah. Is it true?
2844,16,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence."
2845,16,13,Butters Stotch,"Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole, [pokes Stan in the belly] but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. [smiles, turns and walks away]"
2846,16,13,Stan Marsh,[looks heavenward] We did it. [Butters goes around a corner and out of view]
2847,16,13,Anchor,It has become the biggest concern for most people. The farmers of Belarus and their plight against their government. And now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis. His name? Jesus.
2848,16,13,Jesus Christ,"These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can."
2849,16,13,Field Reporter,"Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use?"
2850,16,13,Jesus Christ,"You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. [a tank unleashes a bomb and a bunch of farmers are killed]"
2851,16,13,Farmers,"AAAAH!! [the tanks open fire with machine guns; more farmers are killed, until the last one falls]"
2852,16,13,Jesus Christ,"You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help."
2853,16,13,Field Reporter,"Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus."
2854,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. [the tanks and bulldozers move forward to crush the corpses of the farmers]"
2855,16,13,Field Reporter,"Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?"
2856,16,13,Jesus Christ,I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!
2857,16,13,Field Reporter,"Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?"
2858,16,13,Jesus Christ,"What? [turns around] Aw, shit!"
2859,16,13,P F Pityef,"One at a time, please. One at a time."
2860,16,13,Mr Mackey,"Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?! [it looks like everyone else does too.] It's worthless now!"
2861,16,13,P F Pityef,"Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!"
2862,16,13,Eric Cartman,"[steps up] Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle."
2863,16,13,P F Pityef,Absolutely! Five dollars please.
2864,16,13,Kyle Broflovski,Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
2865,16,13,Stan Marsh,[glares at Kyle] Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! [a bouncy noise is heard]
2866,16,13,P F Pityef,"Oh my, it's the sound!"
2867,16,13,Butters Stotch,Wu-what sound?
2868,16,13,P F Pityef,"Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound. [puts his ear against a funnel in which a penny circles round] That's the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It's the sound of the last cent being spent. [quickly goes to a control panel and starts pressing buttons, and his stand collapses into a truck. He gets in and drives off] My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!"
2869,16,13,Eric Cartman,"...Fuck! Dude, weak. [the town is covered in scauses and looks like a Dr. Seuss town]"
2870,16,13,Stan Marsh,"It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along."
2871,16,13,Jesus Christ,Yeah...
2872,16,13,Stan Marsh,We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
2873,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us."
2874,16,13,Stan Marsh,Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
2875,16,13,Jesus Christ,What can we possibly do?
2876,16,13,Stan Marsh,"[after a long while] What would Jesus do? [Rocky fanfare plays and Jesus slowly gets energized. He gets off the sofa and walks to the dining room table, reaches into his robe and pulls out a big bottle of HGH. He plants it on the table and opens it. He pours some into the cap and drinks it. He transforms into a superhuman and flips the dining room table over. He turns and breaks through the front wall, obliterating the front door, and runs off to find the charlatan. Stan looks on] Yeheah! [Jesus goes to the Scauses factory and flips over every truck he finds in his way, then bursts into the factory. He beats up all the workers there]"
2877,16,13,Jesus Christ,Vengeance is mine! [he destroys the assembly line]
2878,16,13,P F Pityef,No please! Please show mercy!
2879,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Get out! [picks him up and shoves him into a grinder. P.F. Pityef is ground up, but his remains clog up the grinder and raise the pressure throughout the factory. Soon the factory blows up. Everyone in town has shown up to see this and burst into applause. Later, Jesus is back to normal and on a small hill - a mount - and speaks to the crowd]"
2880,16,13,Jesus Christ,"Thank you my children. [the crowd quiets down] We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is [places his hands over his heart] right here. On T-shirts! [opens his robe enough to show his cause] Free Pussy Riot! [the crowd begins to clap and cheer]"
2881,16,13,Mr Mackey,Free Pussy Riot!
2882,16,13,The Boys,[look at each other and then] Yeah!
2883,16,14,Denver Poll Worker,"Okay, Mr. Thompson, voting line is right over there. [Mr. Thompson walks off] Next, please. [Cartman shows up dressed up in his festival best - dress shirt, suspenders, hat with a ribbon on it, and an all-day sucker. He's going to play on the sympathies of the elderly poll workers]"
2884,16,14,Eric Cartman,Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
2885,16,14,Denver Poll Worker,"Oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy?"
2886,16,14,Eric Cartman,MOM!
2887,16,14,Denver Poll Worker,Security?
2888,16,14,Denver Guard,[shuffles up to the poll worker] Heaah?
2889,16,14,Denver Poll Worker,This little boy lost his mom.
2890,16,14,Eric Cartman,She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
2891,16,14,Denver Guard,"It's all right, come on. [takes Cartman's hand and walks him away]"
2892,16,14,Eric Cartman,Mom? Where's my mom?
2893,16,14,Charlotte Poll Worker,"Oh dear. Did you lose your mommy, little boy?"
2894,16,14,Flight Attendant 1,"[to the aisle passenger] Would you like some warm nuts, sir?"
2895,16,14,Eric Cartman,"[wriggles in his seat and laughs] ""Warm nuts"", she said."
2896,16,14,Eric Cartman,Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
2897,16,14,Flight Attendant 2,"Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts?"
2898,16,14,Eric Cartman,[breaks into a smile and laughs] No way dude. No way.
2899,16,14,Eric Cartman,MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
2900,16,14,Flight Attendant 3,"Would you like warm nuts, sir? [the man accepts the nuts and smiles]"
2901,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. [both passenger and attendant frown at him]"
2902,16,14,Eric Cartman,MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
2903,16,14,Anchor,"The people have spoken, and the President of the United States is once again, Barack Obama."
2904,16,14,President Obama,"I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever. [Ike begins to bawl.]"
2905,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all. [the phone rings and he answers it.] Hello?"
2906,16,14,Eric Cartman,[from the Cartman kitchen] Hey Kyle. What's up?
2907,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Nothing, watching the election results."
2908,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society. [Kyle glances at Ike.] Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you."
2909,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
2910,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Please, Kyle. It's kind of important."
2911,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!"
2912,16,14,Eric Cartman,"You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?"
2913,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
2914,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? [beams]"
2915,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Sure you do!
2916,16,14,Eric Cartman,"What if I did, Kyle?"
2917,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? [Cartman smiles and opens his bedroom door, then shows him in. Inside are stacks and stacks of ballots Cartman has stolen from various states: Nevada, Florida, Idaho, Colorado, Virginia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Kyle's jaw drops]"
2918,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Pretty sweet, huh?"
2919,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is this?
2920,16,14,Eric Cartman,What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
2921,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,I don't believe it.
2922,16,14,Eric Cartman,"No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me."
2923,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Why do you have these?
2924,16,14,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to a stack] Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle. [holds up a ballot] Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. [tears the ballot in two, lets the pieces fall, and fakes a shocked face]"
2925,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Dude!
2926,16,14,Eric Cartman,[Walks over to another stack] Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. [tears up that ballot]
2927,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Knock it off, Cartman!"
2928,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone."
2929,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! [turns around and walks out. Cartman waits a few seconds and walks to his window. He sees Kyle walk to the sidewalk, then turn right and go down the street.]"
2930,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan."
2931,16,14,Liane Cartman,"[steps in] Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?"
2932,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Thanks Mom, [she leaves] I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine."
2933,16,14,Agent (for President Obama),Mr. President?
2934,16,14,President Obama,Yes?
2935,16,14,Agent (for President Obama),"Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso."
2936,16,14,President Obama,"[picks up the receiver and presses the Line 2 button] Yes, hello General."
2937,16,14,General Tso,We assume you are preased with the erection results?
2938,16,14,President Obama,Very pleased. Thank you for your help.
2939,16,14,General Tso,And you no doubt will now begin filling your side of the bargain.
2940,16,14,President Obama,You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours. [hangs up and slumps in his chair a little]
2941,16,14,Agent (for President Obama),"Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised."
2942,16,14,President Obama,"[rises and goes to a window] I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation."
2943,16,14,Agent (for President Obama),And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?
2944,16,14,President Obama,Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken.
2945,16,14,Officer 1,Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
2946,16,14,Eric Cartman,"[strokes his chin] Hmmm, no."
2947,16,14,Officer 2,You mind if we search your room?
2948,16,14,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission."
2949,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it."
2950,16,14,Officer 1,"Let's just see. [the officers go in, and Kyle follows]"
2951,16,14,Eric Cartman,Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
2952,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Upstairs! First door to the left!
2953,16,14,Eric Cartman,I know my rights! Stop right now! [Kyle and the officers go in... and find nothing]
2954,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
2955,16,14,Eric Cartman,"I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing."
2956,16,14,Officer 2,"Oh my God, what have we done?"
2957,16,14,Officer 1,"Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry. [The officers walk out]"
2958,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!"
2959,16,14,Eric Cartman,"But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. [Kyle turns right and runs down the stairs]"
2960,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Guys! You guys! [runs into the group] Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
2961,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Wow, really? That's pretty impressive."
2962,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
2963,16,14,Stan Marsh,But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
2964,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter."
2965,16,14,Stan Marsh,I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
2966,16,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff."
2967,16,14,Craig,"Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me."
2968,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!"
2969,16,14,Butters Stotch,"Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason."
2970,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[stares at Butters for a while] Butters, you know something, don't you?!"
2971,16,14,Butters Stotch,"Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?"
2972,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,[walks towards Butters] What did Cartman tell you?!
2973,16,14,Butters Stotch,"He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think. [glances over his shoulder and gasps] Uh, don't make me say any more!"
2974,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Tell us what you know right now!
2975,16,14,Butters Stotch,"I can't! Don't you see?! [feels around his body for something, and finally finds it: a small bottle. He opens it up and pulls out a blue M&M.] Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it"
2976,16,14,Stan Marsh,Is that an M&M?
2977,16,14,Butters Stotch,"[his voice trembles] It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone."
2978,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Then you have to tell us!
2979,16,14,Butters Stotch,Well... hah... HWAAAH! [quickly swallows the pill and makes sure he doesn't throw up]
2980,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! [Butters falls back, stiff]"
2981,16,14,Stan Marsh,Pry his mouth open!
2982,16,14,Craig,He ate it!
2983,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!"
2984,16,14,Butters Stotch,Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. [passes out]
2985,16,14,Waitress,"More melted butter, sir?"
2986,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Mm, mhm, mhm."
2987,16,14,General Tso,"[lets out an exasperated sigh] Little boy, the President is on his way to pick up the ballots. Where are they?!"
2988,16,14,Eric Cartman,They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
2989,16,14,General Tso,Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want!
2990,16,14,Eric Cartman,Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
2991,16,14,A Diner,"Oh my God, it's the President! [the President comes in with his Secret Service detail and diners come up to greet him]"
2992,16,14,President Obama,"Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private?"
2993,16,14,Diner 1,"Oh, of course. Come on, let's let the President have some peace and quiet. [the diners begin to leave the restaurant]"
2994,16,14,Diner 2,"Wow, the President eats at Red Lobster. He's just a normal guy like me."
2995,16,14,Diner 3,"Come on guys. President says ""get out."" [chuckles]"
2996,16,14,Diner 4,"I didn't actually vote for him. [chuckles. Two agents guard the doors until the diners are gone, then close the doors, while two other agents join President Obama at the table]"
2997,16,14,President Obama,All right. Where are the ballots? [Cartman cracks open a lobster leg.]
2998,16,14,Doctor,Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction.
2999,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Can we please just try and talk to him?
3000,16,14,Doctor,"All right, but don't take too long. [the boys go in]"
3001,16,14,Butters Stotch,[hard to understand with his face puffed up] What's up fellas?
3002,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!"
3003,16,14,Butters Stotch,"Bleh, ogayedmi."
3004,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't wanna have to do this. [opens his flip phone and presses some keys] but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!"
3005,16,14,Butters Stotch,AGH! No! Please! You can't!
3006,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
3007,16,14,Butters Stotch,Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
3008,16,14,Stan Marsh,What'd he say? [Kenny mumbles his reply and Stan understands that] Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? [Butters mumbles a reply]
3009,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"What? [Kenny mumbles his translation] You mean the missile defense program?! [to Butters] Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!"
3010,16,14,Butters Stotch,At Red Robster. [Kyle looks at Kenny]
3011,16,14,Kenny McCormick,(At Red Lobster.)
3012,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,[still not getting it] Where?
3013,16,14,Butters Stotch,[enunciating as best he can] Red Lobster!
3014,16,14,Stan Marsh,Huh?
3015,16,14,Jimmy Valmer,"He said ""at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"""
3016,16,14,Butters Stotch,[enunciating as best he can] Red Lobster!
3017,16,14,Kenny McCormick,(Red Lobster!)
3018,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,What?
3019,16,14,Jimmy Valmer,Ruh Rehh... Red
3020,16,14,Butters Stotch,[stressing] Red Lobster!
3021,16,14,Kenny McCormick,(Red Lobster!)
3022,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh, Red Lobster."
3023,16,14,President Obama,"General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not?"
3024,16,14,General Tso,"Sssure, we have the ballots, but we don't have them right here with us now. [Obama looks at the general, then glances at Cartman]"
3025,16,14,President Obama,"Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!"
3026,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, where are the missing ballots?! [noticing the President] President Obama?"
3027,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted."
3028,16,14,General Tso,"Mr. President, we got you reelected! Now you will give us the Star Wars technology so that we can make the sequels!"
3029,16,14,President Obama,I told you China would get the rights to Star Wars from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure! [looks at Cartman] Until I have those ballots [looks at the general] it is not secure!
3030,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!"
3031,16,14,Morgan Freeman,"[voice only] What's going on is the sale of America's greatest asset. [music plays as he walks into view] You see, when the United States created Star Wars it made this country incredibly powerful."
3032,16,14,General Tso,Morgan Freeman?
3033,16,14,Morgan Freeman,"[pacing back and forth] Earlier this week, Lucas signed the rights to Star Wars over to Disney, and the Chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves. The Chinese government knew that President Obama would help them take the rights from Disney if they helped him get reelected."
3034,16,14,Craig,Ohhhh.
3035,16,14,Morgan Freeman,"But the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them, and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met. You've all got quite a mess on your hands. I wish you well with it. [turns around and goes back the way he came in]"
3036,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman: [Freeman turns around and faces the group] How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?"
3037,16,14,Morgan Freeman,"Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle. [a sparkle lights up on his right cheek as a small bell sounds, fades, and leaves a new freckle there. He turns around and resumes his departure]"
3038,16,14,Eric Cartman,"So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker."
3039,16,14,General Tso,That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you!
3040,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. [takes out a small ball-shaped bomb, smashes it against the table, and disappears in the resulting smoke.]"
3041,16,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken."
3042,16,14,Mike and Agent 2,You are absolutely sure about this?
3043,16,14,Mike and Agent 2,"It's been confirmed, Mike. My God, we might have won this thing. [they reach the end of the hall]"
3044,16,14,Mike and Agent 2,"[knocks three times, then opens the double doors and goes in] Sir? Sir, we have some... incredible news. There are rumors of hundreds of thousands of stolen ballots. You might have won the election after all. [Duck President is shown. He lets out a loud quack with shit spewing out his mouth]"
3045,16,14,Stan Marsh,"There's nothing here, Kyle. [Jimmy walks in from the dining room]"
3046,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Anything in the basement, Jimmy?"
3047,16,14,Jimmy Valmer,"Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos"
3048,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Well keep looking.
3049,16,14,Liane Cartman,"[walks in with some items] Oh my goodness, what's going on?"
3050,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him."
3051,16,14,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?"
3052,16,14,Stan Marsh,He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
3053,16,14,Liane Cartman,"[walks towards the kitchen] Oh well, no TV for him for a few days."
3054,16,14,Jimmy Valmer,"There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue."
3055,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God you guys, look! [points across the street. The boys walk out as the sound of a large vehicle is heard] Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! [Indeed. The ship arrives and positions itself for landing, then descends onto the road. After a big thud, the ship's door opens... and out swaggers Mickey Mouse]"
3056,16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Just what the Dickens is going on here, haha?!"
3057,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Aw shit, it's him again."
3058,16,14,Mickey Mouse,"What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha."
3059,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Butters. [Butters jumps up and is wide awake] You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?"
3060,16,14,Butters Stotch,I didn't say anything. I promise.
3061,16,14,Eric Cartman,"I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you."
3062,16,14,Butters Stotch,"Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!"
3063,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Shhh, it's okay, Butters. [brings forth an M&M bag and opens it] Nobody's gonna find the election ballots. [pulls out a blue almond M&M.] I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look. [places the M&M in Butters' mouth and closes it] A place in town people barely even know exists."
3064,16,14,Salesman,"Hey guys. Lookin' to buy a Hummer today? [a family leaving the KFC across the street heads for its car in the KFC parking lot] We're havin' a Rocktober sales event day that's goin' into Rockvember. [the family piles into the car, the father starts it, and the family drives away. The salesman watches the family leave, then turns around and walks to a different spot - next to the missing ballots.] Hey there! Interested in test-drivin' a Hummer today? [a lone man walks slowly down the sidewalk on a cross street. Mr. Hummer takes out his hands and starts gesturing] I can see you, with the Ray-Bans, got that nice bicep haning' out the window rolled down, whattaya think? [the man looks at him, then begins to walk faster] Rockvember sales event, guys! Every Hummer comes with a free Segway."
3065,16,14,Caf Monet diner,[at a Café Monet across a third street.] Hey why don't you shut up?!
3066,16,14,Salesman,"I'm just excited about all these deals, that's all. [puts his hands in his pockets]"
3067,16,14,Storm Trooper,"We found him sir, but still no sign of the missing ballots."
3068,16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Go on! Leave us alone! Haha. [the storm troopers step outside and the door comes down behind them. Mickey and Cartman walk away from the door] Now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. Every vote counts. And you need-"
3069,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!"
3070,16,14,Mickey Mouse,Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.
3071,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!"
3072,16,14,Mickey Mouse,"[whips out his light saber] Pretty neat, huh? How would you like to have one?"
3073,16,14,Eric Cartman,"I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!"
3074,16,14,Mickey Mouse,[turns off his light saber] Like what?!
3075,16,14,Eric Cartman,I want a part in the new movies!
3076,16,14,Mickey Mouse,"[brightens up] Well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? If you wanna be in the next Star Wars, I'm your guy! Haha."
3077,16,14,Eric Cartman,I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
3078,16,14,Mickey Mouse,"You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle."
3079,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun."
3080,16,14,Mickey Mouse,"Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha."
3081,16,14,Eric Cartman,Haha.
3082,16,14,Mickey Mouse,Haha.
3083,16,14,Eric Cartman,Haha. [and a new partnership is formed.]
3084,16,14,Wolf Blitzer,"This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen!"
3085,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[with a field reporter at City Hall, with the other boys behind them] We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-"
3086,16,14,Field Reporter Chris,"And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us."
3087,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. [sirens and bells sound]"
3088,16,14,Field Reporter Chris,Is that it? Did he just? Did he just?
3089,16,14,Wolf Blitzer,"Yup. Chris, we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time."
3090,16,14,Field Reporter Chris,Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. [confetti and balloons float down from the sky]
3091,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,What?
3092,16,14,Field Reporter Chris,"Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?"
3093,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[quite confused] I... what? [a woman comes in from screen left with a check for five thousand dollars from P.F. Chang while another woman comes in from screen left with a sign saying ""ONE MILLION TIMES!!!!!""]"
3094,16,14,Field Reporter Chris,"He's being presented with the check now, a five thousand dollar gift certificate to P.F. Chang's. [Kyle holds the check up and the reporter gets closer to the camera] This has been a long campaign, but someone's finally done it, Wolf."
3095,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Well, we tried, dude."
3096,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
3097,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?"
3098,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"It matters, Stan. It it matters."
3099,16,14,A Santa,"[voice only] Ho ho ho hoo! [Kyle glances at the TVs and walks over to get a better look] Come on down to Stevenson Hummer for our big Christmas in Humvember Sale! [same dealership as earlier, with Mr. Hummer wearing Santa facial hair and cap, ringing a bell and shaking a rattle stick] Not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season? Why not give them a nice Hummer? Nothing beats a Hummer on Christmas morning! [dances a bit. Stan joins him at Tele's picture window]"
3100,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?"
3101,16,14,Stan Marsh,"Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?"
3102,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,[realizing where the ballots could be] Oh my God.
3103,16,14,Mr Stevenson,"[the salesman] Hey, looking for a Hummer today? Got some 2009s here. Never been driven. ...Ever. [a crow lands on a blue Hummer. Mr. Stevenson notices, turns around and moves towards it] Go on, get out of here! Shoo! [the crow leaves as Kyle and friends show up and enter the lot]"
3104,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Look! There they are!
3105,16,14,Mr Stevenson,"Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!"
3106,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,"We found it, you guys! [hears some vehicles showing up and looks] Oh no, they followed us! [several black cars pull up and the Chinese pour out of them]"
3107,16,14,Mr Stevenson,Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys!
3108,16,14,General Tso,Get out of our way!
3109,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
3110,16,14,General Tso,[pulls out a pistol from his pocket and aims it at Kyle] I am tired of playing games! This little farce is ovah! [a shot from a ray gun obliterates the pistol]
3111,16,14,Eric Cartman,"[on a tauntaun] I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! [police cars show up]"
3112,16,14,Mr Stevenson,Oh my God it's a sales rush! [the police pour out of their cars]
3113,16,14,Officer 2,Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?
3114,16,14,Eric Cartman,"Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?"
3115,16,14,Officer 3,"Sir, we've found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town."
3116,16,14,General Tso,You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made!
3117,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Protect it?
3118,16,14,Officer 4,What the hell is going on here?!
3119,16,14,Morgan Freeman,"[voice only. The officers all face him] Perhaps I can explain it to you. [appears between the Hummers and walks up to the group] You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted Star Wars is because they're afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard Star Wars' impeccable legacy."
3120,16,14,Officer 5,Is that Morgan Freeman?
3121,16,14,Morgan Freeman,"And now we're at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep Star Wars from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, ""What's more important? That the right man is elected President, or that Star Wars is with people who will protect it most?"" [six new freckles appear on his face, and he caresses his right cheek]"
3122,16,14,An Officer,"[through a walkie-talkie] Unit 4, what is it?! Over."
3123,16,14,Officer 1,Well kid?
3124,16,14,Kyle Broflovski,Well... if you put it that way...
3125,16,14,An Officer,Come in Unite 4! What have you found?!
3126,16,14,Officer 1,"Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out. [Stan walks up to the ballots with a match, strikes the match against the asphalt and lights it, and sets fire to the ballots]"
3127,16,14,Eric Cartman,"No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! [the Chinese, the police officers, and the boys all hold hands around the bonfire and begin to chant]"
3128,16,14,Group,"Obama is President again. [as the smoke gathers in the sky, a real-life image of President Obama appears and sways slowly back and forth.]"
