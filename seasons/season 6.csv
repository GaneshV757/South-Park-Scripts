0,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[dialing] Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. [the boys quiet down and cover their mouths as the call goes through to City Wok, a Chinese restaurant.]"
1,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease."
2,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[the boys giggle] Hello, is this City Wok?"
3,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Yes, this Shitty Wok."
4,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[the boys giggle harder] Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef."
5,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,[writing] Shitty Beef...
6,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken."
7,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,[writing] Shitty Chicken... [the boys roar with laughter. Cartman rolls back on the sofa]
8,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude, look! [the others look up and the phone falls off Cartman's lap to the floor] It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!"
9,6,1,Subway Singer,"He's still lookin' good!
[a man appears eating a footlong subway sandwich. The name ""JARED VOGLE"" appears on the screen near the bottom]
His name is Jared
[he struts down a sidewalk. ""LOST 262 LBS."" appears on the screen]
His name is Jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches...
[a side shot of Jared walking smoothly behind a white picket fence in Downtown, then of slices of a party sub, then of the first sandwich]"
10,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh, hey, fellas."
11,6,1,Stan Marsh,Hey Kenny
12,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[upset] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!"
13,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Not-Kenny."
14,6,1,Commercial Announcer,"Hey South Park! [camera switches to the TV. Jared is shown munching away on a sub sandwich behind splash bubbles saying ""JARED LIVE"" ""FREE SUBS"" and ""LOSE WEIGHT"" and ""MEET JARED"" ""SOUTH PARK, COLORADO""] You can meet Jared IN PERSON March 6 at the Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square!"
15,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[excited] Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!"
16,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! That's today!
17,6,1,Stan Marsh,"We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! [Stan and Kyle hop off the sofa and head for the front door]"
18,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[angered] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!"
19,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[hops off and follows Stan and Kyle] Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny."
20,6,1,Butters Stotch,Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. [follows the other three. The phone remains on the floor]
21,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"[the receiver rattles with his voice] Hello! City Wok! City Wok, I take your order prease!"
22,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Excuse me? Could we get through here?
23,6,1,Herbert Garrison,"[turns around] Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours! [begins to dance]
His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-"
24,6,1,Randy Marsh,Here he comes! [the crowd turns left as one and starts clamoring. Jared struts towards the crowd as his theme song comes up]
25,6,1,Subway Singer,"He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches... [Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]"
26,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Thank you all so much. You know what? After a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy! [the crowd cheers] And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss!"
27,6,1,Some men,Alright! [more cheering]
28,6,1,Eric Cartman,That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
29,6,1,A Worker for Subway,"Mr. Vogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich?"
30,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Sure, let 'em in. [the worker lets the boys in and Jared spins around to face them] Hi kids. [the room Jared is in is a dressing room]"
31,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Wow, Jared!"
32,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
33,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side."
34,6,1,Stan Marsh,What kind of help?
35,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides."
36,6,1,Eric Cartman,A- AIDS?
37,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides.
38,6,1,Stan Marsh,I'll bet you can.
39,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Would you like to meet them?
40,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,[steps backwards] Them?
41,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",My aides. Scott! Tyler! [moves to the door. The two aides come in and Jared stands behind them. Then he looks at the blond to his left] Scott is my personal trainer [looks at the light brunet to his right] and Tyler is my dietitian.
42,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler",Hello.
43,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler",Hello.
44,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides."
45,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Yep. Hooray for aides!
46,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial."
47,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.
48,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular."
49,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?"
50,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It matters, dude. [Jared begins to think...]"
51,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Hmmm.
52,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
53,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass."
54,6,1,Eric Cartman,Oh-my-god! [turns around] You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
55,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Tha- that's diarrhea.
56,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise."
57,6,1,Stan Marsh,[following] Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
58,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[softly] That's right Stan. [bolder] It's a cash cow, I tell you."
59,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,That's a great idea!
60,6,1,Eric Cartman,Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
61,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[surprised, steps backwards] Me?!"
62,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?"
63,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one."
64,6,1,Eric Cartman,"I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!"
65,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,But Butters isn't fat.
66,6,1,Eric Cartman,"That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off."
67,6,1,Stan Marsh,"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster."
68,6,1,Butters Stotch,"But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me."
69,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!"
70,6,1,Butters Stotch,You mean like Jared?
71,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
72,6,1,Butters Stotch,[angrily] Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
73,6,1,Stan Marsh,"You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. [the boys begin to sway for each line]"
74,6,1,Eric Cartman,He used to be fat but not no more [Butters brightens up]
75,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
76,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls"
77,6,1,Eric Cartman,[slowing] and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
78,6,1,Butters Stotch,[beaming] Wow.
79,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding."
80,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée","I love you too, Jared. You've changed my whole life.
Her name is Jonez, Christine Jonez
She lost forty pounds when she met Jared-"
81,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something."
82,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée","Jared, what's this all about?"
83,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Uh, Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides."
84,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée",What?!
85,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together. [Christine's jaw drops] What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed?"
86,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée",Am I bummed?! [moves her chair away from Jared and faces him] You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?!
87,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Well of course I knew it.
88,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée",Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?!
89,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
90,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée",Not that big of a deal?! I slept with you!
91,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Aren't you overreacting a little bit?
92,6,1,"Christine Jonez, Jared's fiancée","Well, Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married!"
93,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're my aides now, but after we get married... they'll be our aides [Christine sobs] You'll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, they'll have aides. It'll make things so simple! [Christine throws up her arms, rises from her chair, and runs out of the restaurant sobbing] Christine! [rises and moves to follow Christine, but stops to think] Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth."
94,6,1,Chef,"Hello there, children."
95,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast."
96,6,1,Chef,Fifty pounds? Why?
97,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Uuuh, school project."
98,6,1,Chef,"Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him."
99,6,1,Stan Marsh,Marry him?
100,6,1,Chef,It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
101,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!"
102,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters."
103,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[self-conscious] Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?"
104,6,1,Chef,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. [all of them move away from the counter and towards the back]"
105,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Ugh. [sets his plate down] Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more."
106,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. [scoops out a tablespoon and hands it to Butters, but Butters doesn't take it. Chef enters and Butters begins to throw up]"
107,6,1,Stan Marsh,"[notices] Chef, we need more food."
108,6,1,Chef,"I'm runnin' out, children. [leaves. Butters vomits some more]"
109,6,1,Eric Cartman,Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
110,6,1,Stan Marsh,"[soberly] Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed."
111,6,1,Eric Cartman,So how long until we can joke about it?
112,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
113,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Wugh, that's a long time to wait."
114,6,1,Butters Stotch,Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
115,6,1,Eric Cartman,Then eat your puke.
116,6,1,Butters Stotch,No!
117,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. [Butters looks at Cartman, then at his puke. Reluctantly he scoops it up and eats it.]"
118,6,1,Subway Representative,"Ladies and gentlemen, we at Subway are happy to inform you that Jared has elected to stay in South Park in order to speak to you once again! [the crowd oohs and aaha]"
119,6,1,Man 1,He's going to speak with us once again!
120,6,1,Subway Representative,"So, here he is, Jared! [the crowd cheers, and Jared is again walking towards them, grinning]"
121,6,1,Subway Singer,"He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time... [Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]"
122,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway's is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight!"
123,6,1,Subway Representative,All right! [pumps his arm as the crowd reacts]
124,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","But, [the crowd quiets down] I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't just Subway sandwiches that made me thin."
125,6,1,Subway Representative,...Huh?
126,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides. [grins with relief. The rep's jaw drops.]
127,6,1,Man 2,Huh?
128,6,1,Man 3,What?
129,6,1,Man 4,Did he say AIDS?
130,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides! [the crowd immediately begins to disperse]"
131,6,1,Man 2,Oh my God!
132,6,1,A woman,Is he serious?
133,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible! [the rep, looking on in dismay, has had enough and pushes Jared out of the way to take the mic]"
134,6,1,Subway Representative,"Uh, the opinions expressed by Mr. Vogle are not necessarily those of the Subway Company. [Jared soothes his left arm a bit]"
135,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! He looks great!
136,6,1,Stan Marsh,"How do you feel, Butters?"
137,6,1,Butters Stotch,"W-well, k-kinda like Cartman. [Cartman slaps Butters and shakes him] Aw!"
138,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself, man!"
139,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Alright, now it's time for phase 2."
140,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Welcome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try Shitty Chicken today?
141,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime."
142,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,You want the Shitty Beef?
143,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
144,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Which one? I see two fat friends.
145,6,1,Eric Cartman,[pointing to Butters] The fat one!
146,6,1,Stan Marsh,"We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world."
147,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,...Why?
148,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
149,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Oh! You mean like-a Jared?!
150,6,1,Eric Cartman,Just like Jared.
151,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"His name is Jared, he lose some weight. Shitty Wok food sure is great. Yeah, okay. That sound good. Saw if he lose weight eating Shitty Wok, I pay use to use him in commercial."
152,6,1,The Boys,All right!
153,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Sir, we are in business!"
154,6,1,Subway Representative,"[second from left] Jared, first of all we want to say that all of us here at Subway appreciate everything you've done for our company."
155,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","[happily] Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me."
156,6,1,Subway Rep 2,"[second from right] Yes, well, it is now the opinion of all of us that perhaps it would be best for you to take your... strange theories on weight loss elsewhere."
157,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",[crestfallen] ...'Scuse me... am I being fired?
158,6,1,Subway Rep 3,"[center] Jared, it's just that your new take on weight loss is contrary to our commitment to good health."
159,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",How so?
160,6,1,Subway Representative,"Well, your new slogan, for instance. [clears his throat] ""When it comes to fitness, Subway goes hand in hand with aides."""
161,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","[softly] Ah-hah. [he rises and leaves the ""SANDWICH MARKETING"" building with hands in pockets. He closes the door and walks away dejectedly. He passes a basketball court where a few people are shooting baskets. He looks at them as he passes by. Then he stops, looks at the camera, sighs, and ]"
162,6,1,Subway Singer,"His name is Jared. Jared lost weight eating Subway, now he's cold and alone and with no place to call his home. He liked sandwiches with Philadelphia cream cheese."
163,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[heard from the outside] Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again! [the camera goes inside. People are exercising on all sorts of equipment. A woman runs by on a track on the second floor. Butters is pulling at a rowing machine as Cartman spots him. Cartman is eating Cheesy Poofs and barking orders] You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!"
164,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[looks at Cartman] Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat."
165,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[normal] Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here."
166,6,1,Butters Stotch,Well alright then.
167,6,1,Eric Cartman,[barking] Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
168,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides! [his aides come in]
169,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler","Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that?"
170,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while."
171,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler","Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you."
172,6,1,"Jared's Aides, Scott and Tyler",Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides.
173,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",[brightening] Wait a minute... you're right! [moves towards the camera] Yeah! I think I know how to be a celebrity again! [heads for the door]
174,6,1,Stan Marsh,Did you bring the camera?
175,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we're all set."
176,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[steps in between them] Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business."
177,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what do you mean?"
178,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several."
179,6,1,Stan Marsh,That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
180,6,1,Eric Cartman,I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
181,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! [he and Stan are awed]
182,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea."
183,6,1,Butters Stotch,[arrives as Cartman speaks] Hey fellas.
184,6,1,Stan Marsh,Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
185,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you're still fat!"
186,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it."
187,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!"
188,6,1,Butters Stotch,Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
189,6,1,Eric Cartman,"No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!"
190,6,1,Stan Marsh,[Kyle finally produces the camera] Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
191,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know..."
192,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why are you doing this to us?!
193,6,1,Stan Marsh,All prepared for liposuction surgery?
194,6,1,Eric Cartman,Check.
195,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh, I don't know about this, fellas."
196,6,1,Stan Marsh,"[shoots back] Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. [Cartman makes sure the scalpel is sharp]"
197,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[faces Stan] Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip."
198,6,1,Eric Cartman,That should blah [babbles a bit] ah- here. [cuts into Butters' abdomen]
199,6,1,Butters Stotch,[reacts] Woahhh!
200,6,1,Eric Cartman,Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
201,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. [Cartman picks up one end of the tube and inserts it into the incision]"
202,6,1,Eric Cartman,Alrighty.
203,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy."
204,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I think it's in. [turns around]"
205,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. [Cartman stalls, then picks up the other end and starts sucking the fat out]"
206,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[spits out the hose as soon as the fat hits his lips] Bohogh, egh. [puts the hose into the pail for the fat to collect]"
207,6,1,Butters Stotch,Waaaahh!
208,6,1,Eric Cartman,There it goes.
209,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, it's working!"
210,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[wipes away a bit of fat remaining on his lips] Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes."
211,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good."
212,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault."
213,6,1,Butters Stotch,Everything's getting dark...
214,6,1,Stan Marsh,We've gotta hurry this up. [moves behind the coffee table to Butter's belly and starts pounding on it. The fat begins flowing out faster]
215,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[looks at the fat flowing out] Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good."
216,6,1,Stan Marsh,He's losing weight. [Kyle smiles]
217,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, whoa. Whoa! [the fat rushes out so quickly the tube begins to buck, splattering fat and blood all over the place]"
218,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's out of control! [Stan has stopped pounding, but the fat is pulsing out and Cartman can't control it.. Butters gets thinner by the second and headed for shock]"
219,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. [the sound of a car pulling up is heard]"
220,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home."
221,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, crap!"
222,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, bail! [the three boys rush out the back door, then the front door opens and Butter's parents walk in. The living room is a mess]"
223,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,Butters? Butters?!
224,6,1,Butters Stotch,[listlessly] Mom. Dad.
225,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!
226,6,1,Butters Stotch,Yes sir.
227,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
228,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Four times, mom."
229,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!"
230,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Yes, sir. [rises and... struggles. He falls off the coffee table to the floor. Stephen isn't fazed, but Linda is affected]"
231,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!"
232,6,1,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in."
233,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Ladies and gentlemen, a-at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation!"
234,6,1,Jimbo Kern,What?!
235,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides! [a long silence follows as the audience just looks at Jared]
236,6,1,Mayor McDaniels,This guy's insane.
237,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","But I won't stop there. I'm gonna seek out all the underprivileged and hungry children of the world, and I'm going to give them aides myself!"
238,6,1,Chef,You're gonna give children AIDS?!
239,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful child on this earth has aides by next month! Aides for everyone! [another long silence]"
240,6,1,Skeeter,Get him! [the crowd begins to move forward angrily and Jared leaved the podium]
241,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Butters. Time to go."
242,6,1,Butters Stotch,Uh- go where?
243,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
244,6,1,Butters Stotch,"I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. [lifts his shorts to show the bandage over the scar]"
245,6,1,Stan Marsh,What?
246,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days."
247,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!"
248,6,1,Butters Stotch,"[counts off] Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?! [moves his hands palms down to wash his hands of any more trouble] Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!"
249,6,1,Stan Marsh,...Kenny would have done it.
250,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yep.
251,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was? [whispers] God. [normally] He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever."
252,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!"
253,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you."
254,6,1,Butters Stotch,No- but you don't sound like me.
255,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[begins sounding something like Butters. Kyle looks on] Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money."
256,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that was pretty good."
257,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Alright, it's settled.Come on, Butters. [pulls Butters out the door. Cartman enters the house]"
258,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! [the others leave and he closes the door]"
259,6,1,Eric Cartman,Eh. [makes himself comfortable on the sofa and turns on the TV. He grunts a bit] Eh. Yeah. [the phone rings; he answers] Well hello?
260,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"[at an office full of cubicles] I'm just checking in on you, Butters. [a woman walks down the aisle behind him] Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!"
261,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it."
262,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,Jacking it? Jacking what?
263,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad."
264,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!
265,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch."
266,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,OH YOU'RE GONNA GET IT MISTER! Just Wait until I get home!
267,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Bring it on, queer bait. [hangs up] Aaaahhhh, yes! [puts his arms behind his head, quite satisfied with himself]"
268,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","...I tell my [paf] girlfriend I have aides and she leaves, I tell the [paf] world to get aides and they think I'm crazy, I offer to give aides to kids and everyone wants me [paf] dead! [the camera pulls back and the thing Jared is beating is a dead horse. Literally] What's wrong with [paf] aides?! Why doesn't anyone want me to give them [paf] aides?! [the crowd arrives with torches, charging noisily]"
269,6,1,Herbert Garrison,"There he is, beatin' that dead horse!"
270,6,1,Man in Crowd,Alright!
271,6,1,Jimbo Kern,Let's get him! [the crowd charges forward and Jared runs away again]
272,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Aahhh!
273,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Welcome ta Shitty Wok. Take your order prease.
274,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.

283,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Yah they, they gonna kill him. They gonna kill Jared downtown right now."
284,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. [the boys exit the store]"
285,6,1,Terrance & Phillip,"Here's a man's fart for ya. [farts, laughs]"
286,6,1,Terrance & Phillip,"God no! [laughs again, and Cartman joins in. The phone rings] Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!"
287,6,1,Eric Cartman,[answering] Hello?
288,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"[calling in from her office] Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!"
289,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom."
290,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"[stunned, then] Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!"
291,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure."
292,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
293,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank. [hangs up] Eh. [resumes eating]"
294,6,1,Terrance & Phillip,"Ey! There's some anthrax over there! [farts, then roars with laughter]"
295,6,1,Terrance & Phillip,"Oh no, hahahahahahaha."
296,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Why did I ever do those stupid commercials?
297,6,1,Mayor McDaniels,"Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!"
298,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,[offscreen] Wait! [the boys run up to the gallows platform] You're all making a mistake!
299,6,1,Chef,"Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!"
300,6,1,Stan Marsh,"No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have ""AIDS,"" AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides."
301,6,1,People in Crowd,[softly] Oh.
302,6,1,Mayor McDaniels,"You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides?"
303,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman",Yes. ...Y-you mean you all thought...? Oh my Gosh!
304,6,1,Skeeter,"Oh boy, do I feel stupid."
305,6,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh we're so sorry, Jared"
306,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","No no, hey it was my fault. I can't believe I- I, I didn't think of what I was saying! [giggles]"
307,6,1,Chef,"Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! [laughs]"
308,6,1,Randy Marsh,Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! [several people laugh]
309,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","[laughing] Oh my God! I told my girlfriend I wanted her to share my aides - oh, no wonder she left!"
310,6,1,Herbert Garrison,"[laughing] Cuh-can you imagine what we thought when you said, ""Aides for Everyone Foundation?"""
311,6,1,"Jared Vogle, Subway spokesman","Oh, brother!"
312,6,1,Skeeter,Aha- [stops and realizes something] ...Hey. We're all laughing. [everyone stops and listens]
313,6,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before."
314,6,1,Randy Marsh,"Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!"
315,6,1,People in Crowd,Ooo.
316,6,1,Mayor McDaniels,He's right. It happened!
317,6,1,Jimbo Kern,Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny!
318,6,1,People in Crowd,Alright! Yay! Woohoo! [fireworks come up out of nowhere] Hooray!
319,6,1,Mr Mackey,I knew it would be funny someday! [laughs] AIDS!
320,6,1,Herbert Garrison,"Then it's time... We can undo the banner! [fanfare comes up, and a man pulls a curtain away to reveal a huge golden plaque reading ""AIDS IS FINALLY FUNNY"" Ooohs and aaahs follow.]"
321,6,1,One New Yorker,Hooray!
322,6,1,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in the town square where just moments ago it was declared that AIDS... can finally be joked about. What a great day for humanity"
323,6,1,Herbert Garrison,"[laughs, then] ""AIDS quilt"" [resumes laughing. The crowd disperses and Tuong Lu Kim finds the boys]"
324,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh boy, this is fantastic! I so grad AIDS is funny now."
325,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?"
326,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Sure 'kay. I pay you fifteen dowlars.
327,6,1,Stan Marsh,Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
328,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Hey, I'm not a-Subway, I Shitty Wok. Shitty Wok don't have... million dollars."
329,6,1,Stan Marsh,[takes off his hat and throws it on the ground] Oh God-damnit!
330,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, just forget the whole thing then!"
331,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay. [walks off, returns] Hey, you kids know why chicken cross the road?"
332,6,1,Stan Marsh,Why?
333,6,1,Tuong Lu Kim,'Cause it has AIDS. [laughs. The boys just look at him oddly] AIDS so funny! [walks away laughing]
334,6,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, so much for our money."
335,6,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams."
336,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded. [gasps] Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! [rushes away]"
337,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Huh. Huh, uh, uh."
338,6,1,Eric Cartman,"[opens the door in anticipation] There you are, Butters!"
339,6,1,Butters Stotch,[nervous] Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
340,6,1,Eric Cartman,"No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!"
341,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?"
342,6,1,Eric Cartman,"No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!"
343,6,1,Butters Stotch,Hu-oh! Goody!
344,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Here you go. [hands Butters some drawings] I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat."
345,6,1,Butters Stotch,Uh- perfect.
346,6,1,Eric Cartman,Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. [makes his way to the door]
347,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh hey, uh Eric? [Cartman turns around] Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal."
348,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Butters, it was my pleasure. [pulls out his mittens and opens the door, then puts them on. He heads for the sidewalk humming a late night theme song, then turns around to frame the house with his fingers, then walks away]"
349,6,1,Butters Stotch,"Hi, Mom and Dad!"
350,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"DON'T YOU HI MOM AND DAD US YOU LITTLE PUNK!!! ""(Punch)"""
351,6,1,Butters Stotch,Ow! Dad?
352,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! ""(Punch)"""
353,6,1,Butters Stotch,Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
354,6,1,Linda and Stephen Stotch,YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH NOW?! ANSWER ME!!! [a belt is heard coming off and whipping Butters]
355,6,1,Butters Stotch,Aaaa!! [the beating continues]
356,6,1,Eric Cartman,"Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now."
357,6,2,Sharon Marsh,"Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda."
358,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, it was fabulous!"
359,6,2,Linda Stotch,"Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!"
360,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah. We figure that if our boys are goona be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too."
361,6,2,Linda Stotch,"Friends, by default. [giggles]"
362,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void."
363,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!"
364,6,2,Eric Cartman,"[alerting the other two] Look you guys, Butters is asleep."
365,6,2,Stan Marsh,He's such a douchebag
366,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? [drops down] When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water, [takes a glass of water and brings it to Butters' hand] and you put their hand in it... [dunks Butters' hand in it]"
367,6,2,Stan Marsh,"[watches as Cartman climbs the sofa] Yeah, and then what?"
368,6,2,Eric Cartman,"And then, you pee on it! [drops his pants and pees on Butters' hand] heheh-heheheheheheheh."
369,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee."
370,6,2,Eric Cartman,"[still peeing] Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh"
371,6,2,Chris,"And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend."
372,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that."
373,6,2,Chris,"No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation.."
374,6,2,Randy Marsh,They let you stay for free?
375,6,2,Chris,Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
376,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,Well that sounds like a good deal.
377,6,2,Randy Marsh,Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
378,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! [an '80s tune begins to play. A shot of the boys in the living room, then the adults pour in from the kitchen]"
379,6,2,Stephen Stotch,Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!
380,6,2,Stan Marsh,All right! [Butters stirs awake]
381,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,All right! [Butters stirs awake]
382,6,2,Eric Cartman,All right! [Butters stirs awake]
383,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies! [feels some tension as he stretches] Oh, I'm all sticky. [wipes his hands on the sofa and cushions]"
384,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Here we are, everyone. [Before them lies a valley with many buildings in it. Next to the station wagon is a sign reading ""WELCOME TO ASPEN""]"
385,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!"
386,6,2,Chris,Where are Butters and Eric?
387,6,2,Stan Marsh,They're still asleep.
388,6,2,Chris,"Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! [a knock on the door, and Linda rises to answer it. Two men enter]"
389,6,2,Phil,"[brunet] Hello, folks, I'm Phil and this is Josh [a blond]. We're with the Aspen Time-Share Company. [the other parents gather 'round]"
390,6,2,The Parents,Hello.
391,6,2,Josh,You folks enjoying the condo?
392,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,It's lovely. Thank you.
393,6,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!"
394,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,What
395,6,2,Eric Cartman,"So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler."
396,6,2,Stan Marsh,What's a Hitler?
397,6,2,Eric Cartman,"You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?"
398,6,2,Stan Marsh,"No, I never have."
399,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Shh-shh, here he comes."
400,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?! [Cartman starts laughing] A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?"
401,6,2,Eric Cartman,"[knowingly] Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!"
402,6,2,Phil,"Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?"
403,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, do we have to do it right now?"
404,6,2,Josh,"Well, best to do it and get it out of the way."
405,6,2,Chris,"Okay. [Phil and Josh leave, Sheila steps forward, and the adults begin to exit]"
406,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill."
407,6,2,The Boys,Okay.
408,6,2,Chris,We'll meet you boys on the slopes. [exits and closes the door]
409,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Hey, do you guys smell that?"
410,6,2,Stan Marsh,Smell what?
411,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. [Cartman chuckles]"
412,6,2,Eric Cartman,"I don't smell anything. Do you guys? [bursts out laughing. Stan and Kyle just look at him as Butters looks up, wondering...]"
413,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo."
414,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, that why they call is Asspen. [laughs at his cleverness. A skier skis up to them]"
415,6,2,Thumper,"All right, little dudes, [sets his skis aside] great to see you out here. My name is Thumper, and I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor. [gives the boys two thumbs up]"
416,6,2,Eric Cartman,[to Stan] His name is Thumper?
417,6,2,Thumper,"We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...? [puts his left hand to his ear, hoping for an answer. The boys just look at him] Time, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time."
418,6,2,Butters Stotch,So where's the part where we have a good time?
419,6,2,Thumper,"Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here. [motions to the nose, where Butters does indeed have crap]"
420,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Wuh, that's my face, sir."
421,6,2,Thumper,"Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together [he puts his indices and thumbs together; front ski tips touch], in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries. [begins to drift forward] You see that? [wedges the skis] Pizza, [lines up the skis] French fries, [wedges the skis] Pizza, [lines up the skis] French fries. [moves farther away each time]"
422,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?"
423,6,2,Thumper,"Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name?"
424,6,2,Ike Broflovski,Iiiiike!
425,6,2,Thumper,"Okay, Mike, ski down to me! [Ike looks down the hill, but doesn't move]"
426,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Go on, Ike."
427,6,2,Ike Broflovski,"[begins to practice the positions] Pee-za, Fron fries. Pee-za, Fron fries. Fron friiiies. [skis out of control] Peeee-zaaa [skis for a lodge and right through its wall.]"
428,6,2,Thumper,"Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time!"
429,6,2,Phil,"And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4."
430,6,2,Josh,That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!
431,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo."
432,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal."
433,6,2,Phil,"Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - ""Not me, I can't afford it."" But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!"
434,6,2,Josh,Wow!
435,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
436,6,2,Phil,"Well you see, ""time-share"" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves [exits screen left and immediately enters screen right] You [puts his hands together] ""share"" the condo with other investors and pick the [points to his watch] ""time"" you want to stay."
437,6,2,Josh,"[makes a fist with his right hand] Share, [makes a fist with his left hand] time. [joins his fists together] Time share."
438,6,2,Randy Marsh,So then it's not really ours.
439,6,2,Phil,"Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, ""I've got a little place in Aspen."""
440,6,2,Josh,"Try it. Try saying it. ""I've got a little place in Aspen."""
441,6,2,The Parents,I've got a little place in Aspen.
442,6,2,Phil,"Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary ""I've got a nice little place in Aspen?"" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives."
443,6,2,Randy Marsh,"[looks at his watch] Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?"
444,6,2,Phil,"Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend."
445,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
446,6,2,Phil,"Right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting. [the parents just look at him] Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at  the luncheon."
447,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[practicing his moves] ...French fries... pizza... french fries... [does the pizza moves and sees Cartman fallen on his back] come on, Cartman."
448,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, no more., [Kyle skis on. Stan is skiing as well, and another skier comes up to him, showering him with snow]"
449,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Looks like you think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid?"
450,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess."
451,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat me?
452,6,2,Stan Marsh,Uhh... no.
453,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"What's your name, hot shot? [two of his friends join him]"
454,6,2,Stan Marsh,Stan. Marsh.
455,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,Stan Marsh [laughs] Stan DARSH is more like it.
456,6,2,Skier,"Haaaa, Darsh! [his pole is slapped by the first skier's]"
457,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Alright, how about a race, then? You and me."
458,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I'm just learning."
459,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"OooooOOOOooo! [starts moving and squawking like a chicken, ending up facing Stan] Looks to me like you're not a ""hot shot"" after all."
460,6,2,Stan Marsh,I never said I was.
461,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,Oooooooo!
462,6,2,Tad s friends,Oooooooo!
463,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two! [the two other skiers left] See ya later, Darsh! [laughs, kicks some snow into Stan's face, and skis away]"
464,6,2,Phil,"And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,..."
465,6,2,Josh,It's downright smart!
466,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,Aha. [waiters come in with platters of food]
467,6,2,Phil,"Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch!"
468,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!"
469,6,2,Sharon Marsh,[apreciatively] Not bad. [Sheila and the others begin to eat]
470,6,2,Josh,"It's nice to feel rich, isn't it."
471,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, you know, this is really great."
472,6,2,Chris,It sure it. [the waiters whisk the plates away]
473,6,2,Randy Marsh,What?
474,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,What?
475,6,2,Randy Marsh,Wait...
476,6,2,Phil,You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford.
477,6,2,Josh,And then share it with the people that come tomorrow.
478,6,2,Randy Marsh,"All right, look, we've been here for over three hours"
479,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah. Can we go now, please?"
480,6,2,Phil,Of course you can. Go hit those slopes! [softly] If you could just please show me the backs of your table place cards real quick? [the others pick up their cards and look] Oh my God! You got the red sticker!
481,6,2,Josh,They got the red sticker?!
482,6,2,Phil,They got the red sticker!
483,6,2,Stephen Stotch,What's the red sticker?
484,6,2,Josh,"Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes."
485,6,2,Randy Marsh,"No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay."
486,6,2,Phil,"Okay, okay, fine, I mean... [his voice gradually drops to a whisper] It would only take a second, but, I mean, you know, what did we do for you except, give you a free condo for the weekend. Huh. Seems like you could just... could just come up... and see what prize you had... [Josh begins to cry]"
487,6,2,Stephen Stotch,O-all right!
488,6,2,Stan Marsh,...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
489,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries...[loses control and jerks forward, then flips over and lands next to Ike, who's half-buried in the snow. Kyle looks over and gets up quickly. He dusts himself off as Stan catches up] I wonder where our parents are."
490,6,2,Stan Marsh,Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
491,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[arrives, with his friends close behind] well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!"
492,6,2,Stan Marsh,[winces and covers his face with his right hand] Oh no.
493,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?"
494,6,2,Stan Marsh,Heather? [a woman skis up and stands next to the skier]
495,6,2,Heather,"Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves."
496,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean. [giggles]"
497,6,2,Heather,"You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests."
498,6,2,Stan Marsh,[just looks at them] ...who are you people?!
499,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh! [laughs disdainfully]"
500,6,2,Stan Marsh,"All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?"
501,6,2,Tad and friends,Oooooooo!
502,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now!"
503,6,2,Stan Marsh,Okay.
504,6,2,Tad s friends,Race! Race!
505,6,2,Resort Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Aspen Mountain presents another ex-TREME racing showdown. [the gathering crowd cheers] Seven-time World Aspen champion Tad Mikowski versus eight-year-old Stan Marsh!"
506,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Hah! You're going down, little boy!"
507,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, prob'ly"
508,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Do you think Stan has a chance? [the countdown begins. The chutes open and Tad takes off. Stan moves along allowing, sticking to the basic moves] Uh go Stan! [Tad flies down the hill, banking and weaving throughout. Stan appears a few seconds later, going down carefully]"
509,6,2,Stan Marsh,Fries... fries...
510,6,2,A skier,"[Tad zooms past him] He's got it! Tad's gonna win it! [as the crowd cheers, Tad clears the last few hills and then goes through the finish line. He comes to a stop and people gather around him]"
511,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[raising his arms in victory] Yeah! Yeeah! Yeah! You lose, Darsh! [kisses Heather, who reacts. They lock lips. Stan finally crosses the finish line, in the wedge position] Yeah! [Butters, Kyle and Ike walk up to Stan]"
512,6,2,Butters Stotch,"U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you."
513,6,2,Stan Marsh,"[drops his poles] Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. [a group of young adults walk by carrying Tad high in the air. The group stops, the boys turn around to see]"
514,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[looking down at Stan] No hard feelings, right Darsh?! [starts laughing.. The group moves away. The boys turn left as their eyes follow the group] Yeah!"
515,6,2,Teen Girl,"Stan, [theh boys turn to see her] for what it's worth, I think you were really brave."
516,6,2,Stan Marsh,Thanks. Who are you?
517,6,2,Teen Girl,"Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be at the youth center tonight for a dance. I hope you'll come because you're just so... we-hell, you're just so.. well, that's all. [turns around and walks off]"
518,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Finally, we get to go skiing!"
519,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are."
520,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy."
521,6,2,Lift Operator,Can I help you?
522,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?"
523,6,2,Lift Operator,"Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks."
524,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Thank you. [the parents move forward and position themsleves for the lift, which comes down presently. The parents get on and the lift goes up the slope again]"
525,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, this certainly is nice."
526,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody."
527,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!"
528,6,2,Linda Stotch,"Oh, Chris. [Randy giggles, then looks up]"
529,6,2,Chris,"Hey look, this trailer goes right into a building. [the lift turns, drops them off, and moves back out.]"
530,6,2,Phil,"Welcome back, folks!"
531,6,2,Josh,We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
532,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, God-damnit!"
533,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!"
534,6,2,Teen Girl,I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?
535,6,2,Stan Marsh,I' seems fine.
536,6,2,Voguing Skier,"Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building"
537,6,2,Voguing Skier 2,Where are all us kids supposed to go?
538,6,2,Stan Marsh,Don't care. [the boys go further onto the dance floor]
539,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,What do you wanna do now?
540,6,2,Stan Marsh,I dunno.
541,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Let's dance. [begins to dance. Cartman watches with dismay. Butters does a bunch of dancve movies, including the Moonwalk and some break-dancing]"
542,6,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. [the music is stopped and a voice is heard]"
543,6,2,Resort Announcer,"Alright, Aspen-heh. As a special treat tonight we're proud to have the winner of today's race, Tad Mikowski. [moves off and the crowd begins to cheer as Tad approaches the mic]"
544,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,Yeah!
545,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh,. God. [buries his face in his hand again.]"
546,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Hey everyone. [the crowd quiets down] I'd like to sing a little song, if I may."
547,6,2,The Ladies,[swooning] Ooooooooo.
548,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Gah, let's go you guys. [turns around and leads the others towards the door...]"
549,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. [Stan stops in his tracks]Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...Stan. Darsh. Darshy DaaarshStan DaaarshStan Darsh, Stan-darshStan Daaaaarsh DaaarshStan Darsh..."
550,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell is your problem?!"
551,6,2,Tad and friends,OooOOOOOOoooooo!
552,6,2,Stan Marsh,"I raced you, You won!"
553,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought."
554,6,2,Teen Boy,"He'll ski you anytime, anywhere"
555,6,2,Teens,Yeah!
556,6,2,Teen Girl,"[talking to Tad, referring to Stan] But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center"
557,6,2,Stan Marsh,What?
558,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13. [points at a window. The camera pans to the window, and a lone huge peak is shown. Tow teens look and are horrified]"
559,6,2,A Teen Boy,[steps into view] The K-13? But that's the most dangerous run in all of America. [steps away]
560,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?! [starts squawking like a chicken]"
561,6,2,Stan Marsh,"I'll be there, you queen!"
562,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Oh, yeah?!"
563,6,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
564,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow."
565,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?"
566,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I have to!"
567,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[shoves Stan a bit and faces him] Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude."
568,6,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's got Heather!"
569,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,You don't even know Heather!
570,6,2,Stan Marsh,"I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?"
571,6,2,Mechanic,"[appears out of nowhere] The K-13? You don't wanna go down that run. That run has got a history. Thirty-five people have died goin' down it, and some say you can still see their ghosts up there. It was on that very ski run that a group of students were killed by a wolf-boy who escaped from a mental institution. You see, that ski run was once a burial ground to a tribe of vampire Wichicaw Indians who ate the flesh of children with no eyes. Yah-, a lot of history on that ski run. [the boys just look at him]"
572,6,2,Stan Marsh,...Thank you.
573,6,2,Mechanic,Yah. [moves off]
574,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend."
575,6,2,Stan Marsh,"This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!"
576,6,2,Phil,...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving.
577,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
578,6,2,Josh,And we certainly don't want to pressure you.
579,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
580,6,2,Phil,"Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show."
581,6,2,Randy Marsh,"[Rises from his chair angrily] No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! [leads the others towards the door]"
582,6,2,Josh,I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?
583,6,2,Phil,"That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!"
584,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!"
585,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"My God, can you believe those people?!"
586,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation."
587,6,2,Randy Marsh,Let's just get out of here. [opens a door across the hall. The parents find themselves in a room exactly like the one they left across the hall]
588,6,2,Phil,"Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are still deeded properties!"
589,6,2,Parents,"Aaagh!! [they turn around and walk out... er, in]"
590,6,2,Phil,"Oooo, you folks really lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand!"
591,6,2,Josh,That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!
592,6,2,Stan Marsh,That does it! I'm calling the police! [takes out the cell phone and begins dialing. One of the salesmen groans softly]
593,6,2,Stan Marsh,"[approachs] Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13."
594,6,2,Thumper,"K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time."
595,6,2,Stan Marsh,"I have to do this, okay? I have to!"
596,6,2,Thumper,"Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!"
597,6,2,Singer and backup singers,"The day is approaching to give it your best
You've got to reach your prime!

[Thumper and Stan do some Tai Chi on their skis, then Thumper has Stan ski down the hill blindfolded while he takes notes on technique and time]

That's when you need to put yourself to the test
And show us the passage of time
We're gonna need a montage (Montage)
A sports-training montage (Montage)

[The teen girl is reading to Stan from a book: Skiing for ""DUMBASSES."" Then Thumper spots Stan as Stan does barbells, then has him do a few more runs. The times aren't satisfactory.]

And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)

[Bulldozers show up at the youth center to knock it down, but a group of families shows up to protest the demolition. Next shot, the parents are still at those meeting, getting quite weary and tired]

And with every shot, show a little improvement
To show it won't take too long
That's called a montage (Montage)
Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)

[Stan skis down a little faster, and Thumper shows him how much he's improved. Tad is then shown polishing his skills, landing after a ski jump and receiving Heather into his arms. The girl reads to Stan some more, but Stan's fallen asleep. She rouses him and resumes the lesson]

In any sport, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro
You'll need a montage (Montage)
a simple little montage (Montage)

[she shows Stan a few pictures in her book. Next, Stan is skiing down the hill with bricks weighing his shoulders down. Kyle stands on a bluff with a picture of himself and Stan and looks wistfully at it and at K-13. Cartman rubs his finger into his ass and gives a sleeping Butters the Hitler again. Cartman stifles a laugh]

Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)

[Again, Stan skis down the hill with Thumper looking on. Now Thumper approves of the time. The instructor, the teen girl, and Stan look out at K-13 from a nearby hill, the camera at their backs]

If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
Montage (Montage)

[The camera faces the trio now and zooms out slowly. Stan sets his skis down and steps into them, then skis down the slope. Fade out]"
598,6,2,Randy Marsh,"All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!"
599,6,2,Phl,"That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time."
600,6,2,Thin Cop,"All right, let me see if I got this straight. You two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability [suddenly animated] ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars?!"
601,6,2,Phil,That's right!
602,6,2,Fat Cop,Sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be you people for passin' up such a great deal!
603,6,2,Thin Cop,"That's right, you're practically stealing condos at that price. ""Book 'em, Danno!"" [laughs. The parents look on, chagrined]"
604,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, Jesus."
605,6,2,Linda Stotch,No! No!
606,6,2,Gerald Broflovski,"The police work for time-share, too? [the police draw their guns and aim at the parents]"
607,6,2,Phil,"[somewhat menacing, moves forward] The police, the mayor, the president of the United States. Perhaps now you see the severity of your situation. I think we shall all sit down... [backs up] and listen to the presentation."
608,6,2,Josh,[draws his own gun and aims] Sit! [the parents go to the table and sit on the chair]
609,6,2,Phil,"Now, you're probably asking yourselves... ""Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?"""
610,6,2,Josh,"""What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"""
611,6,2,Phil,The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their-
612,6,2,Resort Announcer,The powder is fresh and the stage is set for Tad versus Stan on the K-13!
613,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!"
614,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. [Cartman gives him an angry look]
615,6,2,Resort Announcer,Ready. Set. Go! [the crowd cheers and Tad takes off. Stan begins to ski]
616,6,2,Stan Marsh,Pizza... pizza... pizza...
617,6,2,Man In Yellow Jacket,Tad's got the lead.
618,6,2,Butters Stotch,"Come on, Stan! [Tad is shown zipping down the hill, Stan is still at the summit making his way down]"
619,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,[stops near a tree] Haha. [pulls out a small saw hidden in the back side of his jacket] This should slow down Darsh a bit! [goes to the tree and starts sawing it off at the base. Stan has gone down the mountain some more]
620,6,2,Resort Announcer,[the crowd cheers the skiers on] And it looks like Tad is way out in front.
621,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[finishes sawing the tree in two and laughs] Now, I'll win for sure!"
622,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Awgh, dude, I can't look. [closes his eyes and covers them with his hands  Tad is shown zipping further down the hill, Stan has left the summit]"
623,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"[stops and looks up the hill, then leaves. He returns with a bucket of sand and pours it out]Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! [leaves. Stan continues his run. Tad returns with more sand and pours it out]He doesn't stand a chance, now! [Stan reaches the fallen tree and climbs over it, then continues his run. Tad pours out even more sand]I'm gonna beat 'em! [tosses the bucket away and leaves]"
624,6,2,Resort Announcer,[as the crowd cheers] The race is half over and Tad is still out in the lead! [Stan is moving along nicely. Tad stops further down and pushes a large cage of hamsters onto the slope]
625,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,"Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!"
626,6,2,Teen girl,"[walks in] Oh, Tad."
627,6,2,Tad Mikowski and Two Friends,...What are you doing up here?
628,6,2,Teen girl,"Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these. [lifts up her jacket and top. Tad look and is unable to move as he groans at what he sees. Stan moves along in the background and passes Tad, who remains spellbound. Stan reaches the finish line and breaks it. The boys and the crowd cheer the victory and approach Stan. Another song begins to play]"
629,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Good job, dude!"
630,6,2,Stan Marsh,Thanks. [Tad reaches the finish line to see the celebration start without him. He takes off his goggles and throws them to the ground in anger]
631,6,2,Resort Announcer,"You did it, Stan! [Tad approaches Heather, who gives him the cold shoulder and walks away. Tad is crestfallen]"
632,6,2,Teen girl,"Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center. [the crowd cheers louder, and the mechanic stops by]"
633,6,2,Mechanic,"Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits of the Wakichaw Indians can finally rest in peace. [three spirits rise from K-13 thanking Stan for setting them free.]"
634,6,2,Heather,"[walks up to Stan] Stan, I was wrong about you. Would you like to go out again? [Stan looks at her incredulously]"
635,6,2,Teen girl,"Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted. [the parents arrive]"
636,6,2,Sheila Broflovski,"There you are, boys!"
637,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad!"
638,6,2,Stan Marsh,Where the hell have you guys been?!
639,6,2,Stephen Stotch,"Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office."
640,6,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!"
641,6,2,The Boys,[disappointed] Awwwwww!
642,6,2,Stephen Stotch,What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing? [the song is stopped abruptly]
643,6,2,Stan Marsh,No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! [turns right and leads the other boys away]
644,6,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what a stupid sport! [the parents turn left and follow the boys away]"
645,6,2,Thumper,[looks at the teen girl] I heard that you were the one responsible for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.
646,6,2,Teen Girl,Yeah. Well he really flipped when he saw these. [lifts up her jacket and top again and two creatures appear where her breasts should be]
647,6,2,Left Creature,"[softly, slowly] Quaid..."
648,6,2,Right Creature,"[softly, slowly] Start the reactor..."
649,6,3,Show Announcer,"Today on the Maury Povich show, these poor unfortunate people [a shot of one dwarf walking, then of another being interviewed by Maury] all have horrible disfigurements, [a shot of a man with elephantitis getting some popcorn, then going down an escalator] and you won't believe how we exploit them for your amusement! [Maury interviews a flatheaded man, a blond with stumps for arms wrestles with a brush in the shower]"
650,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Hm, that sounds pretty good."
651,6,3,Kenny,[walks in] (Hey guys. What's going on here?)
652,6,3,Stan Marsh,Hey Kenny! [the three boys grin]
653,6,3,Kenny,"(Gosh darn it, my name's not Kenny!)"
654,6,3,Eric Cartman,"That's awesome, Kenny. [""Kenny"" removes his hood, and it's Butters]"
655,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead."
656,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Not-Kenny."
657,6,3,Butters Stotch,"And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither! [takes off the coat and tosses it away] I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!"
658,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on."
659,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh, all right, then. [takes a seat on the sofa between Kyle and Cartman]"
660,6,3,Maury Povich,Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones
661,6,3,Damla,"[a blonde] Hello, Maury. [walks out. She has spindly legs, but no chest, abdomen or back. Think Mike Wazowski of ""Monsters Inc."" The boys are suitably disgusted]"
662,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Aww, sick dude!"
663,6,3,Maury Povich,"[Damla climbs onto the guest chair] You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you."
664,6,3,Damla,[voice quivering] Thank you
665,6,3,Maury Povich,[leans forward] Can you tell the audience how miseable your life is?
666,6,3,Damla,"Uh-uh, yes. It is."
667,6,3,Maury Povich,[giggles] You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?
668,6,3,Damla,Sometimes.
669,6,3,Maury Povich,[puts his left hand on her forehead] Do people sometimes stare at you?
670,6,3,Damla,Sometimes
671,6,3,Maury Povich,"[sits on the ground in front of her] Do they go, ""Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing""?"
672,6,3,Damla,Mmm-I don't know. [looks away and down]
673,6,3,Maury Povich,Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.
674,6,3,Damla,Yes.
675,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance! [the studio audience applauds, music starts up to lead to commercial] All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman who head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna giver her a makeover!"
676,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!"
677,6,3,Show Announcer,"Do you or someone you know have a disfigurement or disability that we can exploit on the Maury Povish show? If so, call 1-555-HEY MAURY!"
678,6,3,Stan Marsh,Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
679,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cool!
680,6,3,Eric Cartman,Oh YES!! [gets off the sofa and heads for the phone]
681,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh, that'd be awesome! [Cartman dials the number]"
682,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,[he and the other two follow Cartman] Do you think they'll believe it?
683,6,3,Stan Marsh,What disease should we say?
684,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Shhh. Be quite, you guys! [talks to someone on the phone] Hello, is this Maury Povish? [beat] Oh, well who the hell are you? [beat] Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks? [Stan grins, Kyle stifles a laugh] Ye-right, people with disabilities? [beat] Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show. [beat] Great! [beat] Hih-his condition? [beat] Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis."" [beat] Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin. [Stna stilfes a laugh and closes his eyes, then Butters stifles a laugh. All of them giggle. Cartman tells the others] Shut uh- shut up you guys. [beat, then on the phone] Yes. [beat] Yes, of course he's very upset about it. [beat] Yes, he cries all the time. [beat] Miserable, uh huh. [beat] You wha- Really?"
685,6,3,Stan Marsh,[drops his hands] What? [the others follow]
686,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!"
687,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Awesome!
688,6,3,Butters Stotch,Cool!
689,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show. [trying to be subtle] There will of course be a prize involved? [beat] Great. I'll call you back in an hour. [gladly] No, thank you. [hangs up] YES!"
690,6,3,Stan Marsh,This is gonna be so funny!
691,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh, it sure is!"
692,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
693,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?"
694,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
695,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters."
696,6,3,Stan Marsh,"We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?"
697,6,3,Butters Stotch,"We-ell hold on a second, you guys."
698,6,3,Eric Cartman,"[hops off the chair] Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies."
699,6,3,Butters Stotch,Hang on now.
700,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!"
701,6,3,Butters Stotch,Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
702,6,3,Stan Marsh,"It has to be you, Butters. Think about it."
703,6,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
704,6,3,Butters Stotch,"But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad."
705,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
706,6,3,Butters Stotch,"I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. [crosses his arms and looks away]"
707,6,3,Stan Marsh,[looks away and up] Kenny woulda done it. [Butters reacts]
708,6,3,Butters Stotch,...So? I told you guys before: [with emphasis] I'm not Kenny.
709,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool."
710,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend."
711,6,3,Stan Marsh,"[begins to walk and lead the others away] Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. [Butters now looks chastened]"
712,6,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
713,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?"
714,6,3,Brunet Trekker,"Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spirit gum."
715,6,3,Butters Stotch,Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.
716,6,3,Stan Marsh,Where's you get the balls from?
717,6,3,Brunet Trekker,"We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside."
718,6,3,Eric Cartman,Nice.
719,6,3,Blond Trekker,"Now we just blend the skin tones, add a little hair, [spins the chair around] and presto! [shows Butters' new look to the boys. Butters indeed sports a fake scrotum]"
720,6,3,Stan Marsh,Wow!
721,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,That looks awesome!
722,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aw, I feel silly."
723,6,3,Eric Cartman,"They look great on you, Butters. They really do."
724,6,3,Blond Trekker,I believe you owe us payment now? [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
725,6,3,Stan Marsh,"All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I"
726,6,3,Brunet Trekker,Wooww!
727,6,3,Blond Trekker,They weren't lying!
728,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] Why the hell would they want that anyway? [drops to a whisper] Episode I sucked balls.
729,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. [the Trekkers begin to fight over it the tape. Butters checks his new balls self-consciously]"
730,6,3,Blond Trekker,"Here, damnit!"
731,6,3,Brunet Trekker,"Hey, hey! Stop it, man!"
732,6,3,Show Announcer,Gay Air Flight 243 with service to New York now ready for general boarding.
733,6,3,Stan Marsh,"That's your flight, Butters."
734,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, here's your ticket [hands it to Butters] and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. [pushes him forward]"
735,6,3,Butters Stotch,Uh wait. [stops] You guys aren't comin' with me?
736,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV."
737,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[backs up into the lineup] Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go."
738,6,3,Eric Cartman,"God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?"
739,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, he sure is."
740,6,3,Stan Marsh,Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! [pause]
741,6,3,Eric Cartman,Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
742,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[hesitant] Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. [heads for the gate, then turns around. The boys wave at him. Butters looks down, then walks into the plane.]"
743,6,3,Stagehand,"Thanks for coming on the show, kid. Maury is very excited to meet you. And this is the Green Room where you can hang out with the other guests until we call for you on set. Boy with Balls on Chin, meet Man with Foot on Head, Girl with Rapid Aging Disease, Disfigured Country Singer, and Man With No Face."
744,6,3,Butters Stotch,Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
745,6,3,Man With No Face,"[goes for some water] Yes, this is my sixth appearance. [drinks]"
746,6,3,Stagehand,"I'll come back in a bit, folks. [leaves]"
747,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Hey Roger! [the stagehand stops] What the hell is with these horrible veggie platters?!
748,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, we told you last time we want fresher vegetables."
749,6,3,Roger,"I'm sorry, this is what the studio provides. Just take a seat on the couch, kid. I'll be back in a minute. [Butters looks at the others, then makes his way to a spot on the couch and sits down. A long silence follows]"
750,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,...Boy with balls on his chin. Haven't seen you around. How long have you been on the circuit?
751,6,3,Butters Stotch,What circuit?
752,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
753,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?"
754,6,3,Man With No Face,"Oprah two times, Jenny Jones once, Sally Jessie five times."
755,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,[looks at the man with no face] You've only done Jenny once?
756,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Oh, ah I hate doing the Jenny Jones show. They don't even have their own hair people."
757,6,3,Man With No Limbs,I'm doing Jenny tomorrow.
758,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, you picked a good show to do first, kid, but you need to learn the ropes. There are a lot of people like you all over the country, and we all do talk shows for a living."
759,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,We all know each other and we kinda stick together to make sure our industry is protected
760,6,3,Man With No Face,Yeah. Like when someone LIES about being a freak.
761,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[trembling] Oh they, they do, huh?"
762,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Yeah, they'll make up a fake condition to go on these shows and then take our money away!"
763,6,3,Man With No Limbs,We don't take kindly to that.
764,6,3,Butters Stotch,Well I can certainly see why.
765,6,3,Man With No Limbs,It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy.
766,6,3,Butters Stotch,Lobster Boy?
767,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"Yeah, loh-, Lobster Boy used to make appearances on all the talk shows. He was one of the most popular disfigured peoiple on TV."
768,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,But then we all found out that Lobster Boy wasn't a real freak at all. He was just an actual lobster.
769,6,3,Man With No Limbs,[grousing] Lying sack of crap.
770,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,So you know what we did to him?
771,6,3,Butters Stotch,What?
772,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"One night all us freaks got together, and we... boiled him alive. [Butters stares, then an image of a lobster in a boiling pot appears, then vanishes]"
773,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,Now Lobster Boy is no more.
774,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers."
775,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,We're glad you agree.
776,6,3,Stagehand,"Okay, Boy with balls on his chin, you're up next."
777,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[hops off the couch and heads for the door.] Oh, Jesus, see me through this."
778,6,3,Show Announcer,"Next on the Maury Povich show: we bring back some of our favorite disfigured people [four scenes: first, the man with the foot on his head is talking to the girl with rapid aging disease and disfigured country singer, then the disfigured country singer is shown eating a subway sub, then the man with no face shows his disfigurement, and finally Butters' shadow is shown in profile] and introduce you to some new ones"
779,6,3,Stan Marsh,Here he comes.
780,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,This is gonna be awesome!
781,6,3,Maury Povich,Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
782,6,3,Eric Cartman,Testicles and scrotum! [laughs gleefully]
783,6,3,Maury Povich,"Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado. [Butters looks out timidly at the audience from behind the curtain, then heads for the guest chair.] Thanks so much for coming on our show."
784,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose."
785,6,3,Maury Povich,"So, is it tough being ...different?"
786,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uhhh, yeah."
787,6,3,Maury Povich,And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
788,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[forgetting why he's supposedly made of] They sure do. They always say to me, ""Butters, you're not Kenny."" But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-"
789,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, we're losin' him."
790,6,3,Butters Stotch,"I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it."
791,6,3,Maury Povich,"Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?"
792,6,3,Butters Stotch,Uh what condition?
793,6,3,Maury Povich,[terse] You have balls that hang off your chin.
794,6,3,Butters Stotch,"I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that."
795,6,3,Stan Marsh,Phew.
796,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Phew.
797,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that was close."
798,6,3,Maury Povich,What names do they call you at school?
799,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, ""Hey, there goes Chinballs!"" [Stan and Kyle grin, Cartman laughs hard]"
800,6,3,Maury Povich,"And do they call you ""freak"" and ""weirdo""?"
801,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, I s'psoe"
802,6,3,Maury Povich,[sits on the floor and draws closer] Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
803,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh, sure."
804,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you."
805,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Wait, here it is, here it is!"
806,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait, here it is, here it is!"
807,6,3,Eric Cartman,The present.
808,6,3,Maury Povich,"Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!"
809,6,3,Butters Stotch,Oh really?
810,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wow!
811,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""?"
812,6,3,Maury Povich,"Go on, you're going right now!! [Butters hops off and walks away happily]"
813,6,3,Stan Marsh,"But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!"
814,6,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
815,6,3,Eric Cartman,Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
816,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Hello, is this the Maury Povich show? [beat] Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin. [strokes his ""balls""] I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?"
817,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,"[just painted the fingermails on her right hand and is having them dry] I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic."
818,6,3,Eric Cartman,What's the new topic?
819,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,Please help my out-of-control child.
820,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!"
821,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,Really? [pulls out a notepad and starts taking notes] Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
822,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh, sure!"
823,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
824,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies"
825,6,3,Show Telephone Operator,"Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out."
826,6,3,Eric Cartman,"[stunned] ...my, my mom?"
827,6,3,Eric Cartman,Mmoooomm?
828,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Yes, sweetie?"
829,6,3,Eric Cartman,Could yo do me a favor?
830,6,3,Liane Cartman,"What's that, my little man?"
831,6,3,Eric Cartman,Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?
832,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop."
833,6,3,Eric Cartman,"I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?"
834,6,3,Liane Cartman,Orf course I do.
835,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother."
836,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Sweetie, don't."
837,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother. [turns around and walks out] Such a beautiful mother."
838,6,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!"
839,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[still wearing his balls, looking hurt] Oh I'm sorry, mom."
840,6,3,Chris,"Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!"
841,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again."
842,6,3,Chris,"Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!"
843,6,3,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!"
844,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[with voice trembling, turns around] Yes ma'am. [removes his balls]"
845,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? [his phone rings. Butters goes for the receiver]"
846,6,3,Stan Marsh,"[on the other end] Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?"
847,6,3,Butters Stotch,Oh Jesus! They were??
848,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they wanted to find you bad."
849,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?"
850,6,3,Stan Marsh,I- told them where to find you.
851,6,3,Butters Stotch,What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
852,6,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. [hangs up. Butters looks helpless, then walks to the window to see if the freaks are coming. They are indeed]"
853,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh Jesus no. [hops off his dresser and walks away from the window] They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here! [reaches his bedroom door, but turns around] Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! [the doorbell rings.]"
854,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Napoleon? [the disfigured country singer goes for the knob and opens the door.]
855,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"Napoleon Bonaparte? [leads the other freaks in. Butters quickly prepares his false scrotum...] I think he's up here. [opens the door, and Butters grins back at them with one hand on the dresser and a suave pose. His balls are back in place]"
856,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?"
857,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"There you are, Boy With Balls On His Chin."
858,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,We've got big news! The union is striking.
859,6,3,Butters Stotch,"[relaxes] The union? Oh, that's why you came?"
860,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,"We're tired of our crappy prizes! So the union president, Man with Terrible Skin Condition, has told us to round everyone up."
861,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded."
862,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Grounded for what?
863,6,3,Butters Stotch,"For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'. [strikes the pose again] Ah I'm not grounded."
864,6,3,Man With No Face,"Good, then you can march with us. Freaks of the world,"
865,6,3,The Freaks,Unite! [Butters looks at them]
866,6,3,Show Announcer,"Today on Maury Povich: These moms [three are shown. Only Liane grins] don't know what to do with their out-of-control kids! [a fat blonde girl is shown, then Cartman's school picture] Young boys and girls so whorish on our show that it borders on child pornography!"
867,6,3,Maury Povich,[on his stool] We're here talking with moms who think their children are out of control. [the woman next to him blows her nose] Vanessa here says that her thirteen-year-old daughter Vanity is already doing drugs and having sex with older men [Vanessa begins to bawl]
868,6,3,Studio Audience,Ooohhhhhhhh
869,6,3,Maury Povich,"Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework."
870,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"[sobbing] She says she hates me. She, she calls me ""retard""? And, she says my cooch is all dried up and nobody wants it. [sobs some more]"
871,6,3,Studio Audience,Aawwwwww. [music starts up]
872,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well, let's bring her out. Here's Vanity! [she steps out and the awws turn into boos]"
873,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"Wha'evah, wha'evah! You fuckin' cocksuckers don't know shit! Fuck you! [moosn the audience, and an OOPS! bubble appears over the area. Vanity then walks up to her mom and slaps her hard across the face. Vanessa winces in pain]"
874,6,3,Maury Povich,"Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen."
875,6,3,Some audience members,"Yeah! [the rest cheer, then a chant rises from the din] Maury! Maury!"
876,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"Wha'evah! Maury, my mom don't know shit! You could aks her! I aks her all my homies that they be down wit it. You know, it's all good shit. [the audience boos and she holds up her middle fingers, which are blurred] Fuck you, cocksuckuhs!"
877,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Jeez, that girl is pissed off."
878,6,3,Stagehand,"[enters] Okay, Cartman family, you're on in two minutes. [leaves]"
879,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,[weeping] Why can't you just listen to me and love me [Vanity slaps her] Ow!
880,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"Shu' up! Shut the fuck [slap] up, you God-aweful skank! [slap. Vanessa weeps again]"
881,6,3,Liane Cartman,"I'm glad you're not that bad, poopsie-kins"
882,6,3,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize. [leaves the room and finds the stagehand] Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?"
883,6,3,Stagehand,Second door on the right.
884,6,3,The Freaks,Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
885,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Brothers and sisters, the time has come for us to be treated with the respect we deserve! We are a strong and diverse group of people, with members like [shown] Woman with Crablike Body, [shown] Incredibly Obese Black Person, [shown] Man with Brains Outside of Head, and [shown] Liza Minnelli. The talk shows have us on and give us little gifts and perks while they make tens of thousands of dollars."
886,6,3,The Freaks,Yeah!
887,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"We told the talk shows our demands, and they laughed! They say they can get plenty of other stupid guests to go on their shows! So we must picket those other guests!"
888,6,3,The Freaks,Yeah!
889,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys."
890,6,3,Hammerhead Man,You're not gonna picket?
891,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,Who's not gonna picket? [the crown parts and all hands point to Butters]
892,6,3,Disfigured Country Singer,Boy with Balls on Chin doesn't wanna picket. [lowers his left arm]
893,6,3,Butters Stotch,Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
894,6,3,Man with No Limbs,"[emerges from the crowd] Why? You're not a SCAB, are you?"
895,6,3,Butters Stotch,NO I I'm not a scab.
896,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Now, we will split up into groups and form picket lines. The first group will be led by: Incredibly Obese Black Man."
897,6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,"Escuse me, I'm not Incredibly Obese Black Man, I'm Incredibly Black Obese Man."
898,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"[looks at Incredibly Black Obese Man, then says flatly] ...Oh, right. My bad."
899,6,3,Show Announcer,"And now, back to more kids who are out of control, on the Maury Povich show!"
900,6,3,Maury Povich,Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.
901,6,3,Studio Audience,Awww.
902,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,Why won't you kids behave? [Vanity stands and smacks her acroos the face]
903,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"[shakes her mom around by the neck] Shut up, skank, he's not talkin' to you! [slaps her again and sits down]"
904,6,3,Maury Povich,"So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?"
905,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle"
906,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. [a video starts up with Cartman dolled up as a slut moving around to hip-hop music]"
907,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt! [brings out a lollipop] I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!"
908,6,3,Studio Audience,"[gasps, then] BOOOO!!"
909,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he's such a cutie."
910,6,3,Maury Povich,"Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! [steps out from behind the curtain and immediately gives the finger to the audience]"
911,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Wha'evah! Wha'evah! [walks up to a seat next to his mom's and sits there] Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!"
912,6,3,Maury Povich,"Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?"
913,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear."
914,6,3,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs."
915,6,3,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I mean, sex and drugs."
916,6,3,Studio Audience,Oooohhh!
917,6,3,Eric Cartman,[hops off his chair and tries the audience] What-evah! What-evah! [snaps his left-hand fingers back and forth] I'll do what I waunt!
918,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,"Oh, what-evah. You ain't tough, ho! I roam with gangs!"
919,6,3,Eric Cartman,Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! [sits back down]
920,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,What Evah! You ain't bad! You ain't nothin'! I ditch class and go shoot heroin in the school bathroom!
921,6,3,Eric Cartman,"What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!"
922,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,What do we want?
923,6,3,The Freaks,Better prizes!
924,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,When do we want them?
925,6,3,The Freaks,Now!
926,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,What do we want?
927,6,3,The Freaks,Better prizes!
928,6,3,Butters Stotch,[muttering along] Better prizes.
929,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,When do we want them?
930,6,3,The Freaks,Now!
931,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Never. [approached the Man with Terrible Skin Condition] Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me."
932,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together."
933,6,3,Butters Stotch,But I gotta get back to my family.
934,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,"[drops his sign and drops on one knee next to Butters] We're you family too, Napoleon. We're like you. When we look at you we don't even see the testicles on your chin. We see the testicles in your heart. [back to the freaks] What do we want?"
935,6,3,The Freaks,Better prizes!
936,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,When do we want them?
937,6,3,The Freaks,Now!
938,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. [joins the others in the strike. Several police cruisers pull up and police pour out of them]"
939,6,3,Police Captain,"Okay folks, we're gonna have to move along."
940,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Why? We're a union and we have a right to picket.
941,6,3,Police Captain,"I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go."
942,6,3,Middle Dwarf,What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important?
943,6,3,Police Captain,"Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people."
944,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,"...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!"
945,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh."
946,6,3,Show Announcer,Who is the most out of controlled child? We're back with Maury.
947,6,3,Maury Povich,"We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control."
948,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,What evah!
949,6,3,Eric Cartman,I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
950,6,3,Maury Povich,"[walks to the third woman on the panel] Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old."
951,6,3,Studio Audience,Aawwww.
952,6,3,Joline and Chantal,"Mmhmm, that's right Maurih."
953,6,3,Maury Povich,"Let's bring her out: here's Chantal! [Chantal crawls out amid audience boos. The camera focuses on her diaper. Chantal reaches Joline, who picks her up and sits her on the chair next to hers] So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? [Chantal plays with her rattle]"
954,6,3,Joline and Chantal,"Maurih, it's like this: Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked!"
955,6,3,Studio Audience,Ooohhh!
956,6,3,Vanessa and Vanity,Whatevah. I helped in a drive-by shooting.
957,6,3,Eric Cartman,What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
958,6,3,Maury Povich,"Wow, that is out of control!"
959,6,3,Joline and Chantal,"Why, just last night I had three gentlemen callers over to my house, and Chantal took her clothes off right in front o' everybody!"
960,6,3,Studio Audience,Boooo! [Chantal drops down and starts wiggling.]
961,6,3,Joline and Chantal,"You see? [Her diaper drops, then her top.] There she goes. There she goes. [Chantal shows her butt to the audience] OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE!"
962,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,[appearing] Attention Maury viewers
963,6,3,Maury Povich,What the hell is this? [another image replaces the one of Man with Foot on Head]
964,6,3,Elephant Man,"A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of hours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with ""freak"" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, ""Look for the True Freak label"" [his image fades to that of the True Freak label]"
965,6,3,Butters and the Freaks,"[Butters sits atop a True Freak label box and starts off] Look for the True Freak label
[four freaks join in] When you are watching a TV talk show
[a side shot of more freaks streaming their way to the box] Remember somewhere,
[a shot of the audience] our union's growing
[a front shot of the freaks walking in] Our wages going to feed the kids.
[a front shot of more freaks walking in] And run the house-
We work hard, but who's complaining?
[a zoom-out shot as the freaks crowd in around Butters] With TFU we're making our way!
[a pan shot] So always look for the True Freak label,
[a full crowd shot] Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.!
[the Maury Povich logo is restored]"
966,6,3,Maury Povich,"Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-"
967,6,3,"The Freaks, including
Man With No Face
Man With Foot On Head
Disfigured Country Singer
Man With No Limbs
Man With Terrible Skin Condition, their leader
Incredibly Obese Black Man
Dwarves
Elephant Man","They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. [takes her hand and leads her out. Other audience members begin to grouse and leave]"
968,6,3,Maury Povich,"[pleading] Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!"
969,6,3,Eric Cartman,[hops off his chair and steps forward] Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! [more audience members leave]
970,6,3,Show Cameraman,"Sir, the ratings have just started to plummet."
971,6,3,Maury Povich,"Ah, those damned freaks! [throws his microphone against the back wall and heads for the exit]"
972,6,3,Maury Povich,I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?! [the freaks simply look back at him] Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! [goes in and slams the door shut. A few seconds later the freaks cheer their victory]
973,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,We did it! The strike worked!
974,6,3,Man with Terrible Skin Condition,Now we can go on with our careers!
975,6,3,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. [drops his sign and moves off. An angry Cartman catches up to him]"
976,6,3,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! [rips the balls off Butters' chin. The frreaks react immediately and fall silent]"
977,6,3,Butters Stotch,Oh. Double hamburgers.
978,6,3,Man with Foot on Head,Jesus Christ! That out-of-control kid ripped poor Napoleon's balls right off!
979,6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,Get him!
980,6,3,Eric Cartman,Aaahh! [three freaks trail behind with a boiling pot of water]
981,6,3,Incredibly Obese Black Man,"Get him! Get him! [the freaks charge at Cartman, who runs off in fear]"
982,6,3,Butters Stotch,Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. [a taxicab pulls up and screeches to a halt]
983,6,3,Chris,[quickly exits the cab with Linda] Butters!
984,6,3,Butters Stotch,[anticipating] Oh I know.
985,6,4,Ms Choksondik,"Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher."
986,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob."
987,6,4,Ms Choksondik,Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.
988,6,4,Kids,"Hi, Rancher Bob."
989,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.
990,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,[to Stan] City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
991,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death. [a shot of the cows looking back at the class.]"
992,6,4,Eric Cartman,They look so delicious. [Kyle looks at him]
993,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"[leading the class down a line of cows] Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers. [a cow moos and a guillotine comes down, chopping its head off.]"
994,6,4,Kids,Eewwww!!
995,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, dude. [Two workers come and carry the cow's body away, leaving the head behind. Rancher Bob reaches down for a skinned leg and holds it up]"
996,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Hey, anybody want a free sample?"
997,6,4,Eric Cartman,[raises his arm up with glee] Memememee!
998,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"[now standing next to a darkened doorway] And in here, boys and girls, we have our... [flips on a switch, illuminating the room beyond.] veal ranch. [the class looks at the baby calves in the room. A closeup changes the music from spritely to somber. A shot of the class, with some kids showing some dread. Bob walks over to a calf and kneels by it] You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal."
999,6,4,Stan Marsh,Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
1000,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,Yeppir.
1001,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??"
1002,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Well, if we called it ""little baby cow"" people might not eat it."
1003,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wouldn't have."
1004,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Huh, me neither."
1005,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man, look at that one! [moves towards the calves] It looks delicious."
1006,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,What??
1007,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Mm, succulent and juicy. [reaches the calf he was eyeing] Can we have a free sample of these, too?"
1008,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store."
1009,6,4,Eric Cartman,Alriiight!
1010,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Tomorrow morning? [a shot of the calves has Stan, Kyle, and Butters transfixed. The rest of the class leaves] Dude, we gotta help them."
1011,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
1012,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[knocks twice on the wall below the window] Pst, Cartman."
1013,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[responding to a dream] No, Uncle Jesse, no!"
1014,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[knocks twice while saying] Cartman, wake up!"
1015,6,4,Eric Cartman,[wakes up and sees his friends] What? What the hell are you guys doing??
1016,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[opening the window] Come on, we've gotta go!"
1017,6,4,Eric Cartman,Where are we going?
1018,6,4,Stan Marsh,"We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!"
1019,6,4,Eric Cartman,What? Why?
1020,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!"
1021,6,4,Eric Cartman,So?
1022,6,4,Stan Marsh,"So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!"
1023,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass,"" ""butthole,"" and ""douchebag."" I really don't feel like you guys's friend. [lies back down and closes his eyes]"
1024,6,4,Stan Marsh,"We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together."
1025,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the ""Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."""
1026,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[heaves softly] Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!"
1027,6,4,Eric Cartman,[sits up] Oho! So you need me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
1028,6,4,Stan Marsh,[plainly] Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
1029,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. [turns his ass to Kyle, lowers his pants and underwear, and waits]"
1030,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
1031,6,4,Eric Cartman,Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
1032,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Screw you, Cartman!"
1033,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss. [softly] Kiss it."
1034,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Go on, dude it's the only way."
1035,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,No!
1036,6,4,Eric Cartman,Kiss it. Come on. [gruffly] Kiss it.
1037,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Just do it really fast, and we can go."
1038,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Have Butters kiss it.
1039,6,4,Eric Cartman,"No, it has to be Kyle. [turns away. Kyle resists for a few moments, then slowly moves his face towards Cartman's ass through the window. Kyle finally reaches the ass and Cartman unleashes a juicy fart. Kyle withdraws in fits and starts]"
1040,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Awww! [wipes off his face and then waves away the smell]
1041,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[laughs uproariously] Oh man, that was soho awesome!"
1042,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Sick! I felt it on my face!
1043,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!"
1044,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Hell, I'm not goin' with you! [lies back down and closes his eyes again]"
1045,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hyaaaa! [lunges at Cartman and starts hitting him]
1046,6,4,Eric Cartman,Heeeey! [rolls off the bed and the wrestling continues]
1047,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: ""Not for actual breaking and entering. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."""
1048,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too! [holds up parts of a torch] How does this thing work, Cartman?"
1049,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[heaves and takes the torch from Stan] Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask [hands it to Stan] and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. [opens the gas valve and lights the gas stream. A blue flame shoots out and the other boys jump back.]"
1050,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[softly into his headset] Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta."
1051,6,4,Eric Cartman,[peers down. Butters and Kyle join him] You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
1052,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[looks up and calls out] I said that's far enough! [the harness drops to the floor. He gets up and unlocks himself out of the harness, and it goes back up. A calf looks back at him innocently. Stan moves up behind the calf, the softly] Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose. [removes the chain] There you go. You're free. Run away! [the calf doesn't move, and Stan gestures] Go! They're gonna murder you."
1053,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off."
1054,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,You need to freeze some of your ass off.
1055,6,4,Eric Cartman,"O! At least I have an ass, Jew!"
1056,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What? [below, Stan removes the chains from the remaining calves]"
1057,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you stupid baby cows! [walks towards the door and lifts up the security bar, then opens the door] You have to get out of here. [they just lift their heads and look at the entrance. The other boys join Stan inside the veal ranch]"
1058,6,4,Butters Stotch,Huuh what's the matter?
1059,6,4,Stan Marsh,They aren't leaving.
1060,6,4,Eric Cartman,See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
1061,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
1062,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah, they're too weak to move. [a shot of the calves again] Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back."
1063,6,4,Butters Stotch,No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
1064,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house."
1065,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
1066,6,4,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
1067,6,4,Eric Cartman,"I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood."
1068,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!"
1069,6,4,Butters Stotch,Eh yeah I do too!
1070,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[moves towards the calves] We're just gonna have to carry them one by one. [lifts up his first calf] Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Butters look at each other, then move to join Stan]"
1071,6,4,Eric Cartman,Eh! [follows]
1072,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. [pushes the calf further across the ice]"
1073,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer."
1074,6,4,Stan Marsh,We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
1075,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Butters had that at his house?
1076,6,4,Butters Stotch,[enters carrying a box] Hey fellas!
1077,6,4,Stan Marsh,Butters! [Butters turns] Did you bring it?
1078,6,4,Butters Stotch,I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
1079,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,All right!
1080,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[reads the box] ""Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser."""
1081,6,4,Stan Marsh,What?
1082,6,4,Butters Stotch,"""Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"""
1083,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?"
1084,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works."
1085,6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Marsh."
1086,6,4,Sharon,Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
1087,6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property."
1088,6,4,Sharon,Stole? A-a-are you sure? [Randy and Shelly appear next to her]
1089,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"I followed a calf-curling trail right to your house, ma'am."
1090,6,4,Shelly,"Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom."
1091,6,4,Sharon,"Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding. [she leads the others upstairs to Stan's room.] Stanley, did you see-? [she's stunned at what she sees]"
1092,6,4,Stan Marsh,Aw crap!
1093,6,4,Sharon,"Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?"
1094,6,4,Stan Marsh,[points an accusing finger at Rancher Bob and approaches] That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
1095,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh","Stanley, they belong to him."
1096,6,4,Stan Marsh,"They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die."
1097,6,4,Shelly,"Let me hit him, Mom!"
1098,6,4,Sharon,"Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and [points at him] you don't have a choice! [Stan looks dejected, then defiant. He closes his door and locks himself in with Cartman, Butters and Kyle. Sharon then pounds on the door and tries to open it] Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!"
1099,6,4,Stan Marsh,No!
1100,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh","Stan, you're behaving like a kid!"
1101,6,4,Stan Marsh,You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the ones who knew we were making little baby animals suffer! [walks off to his right]
1102,6,4,Sharon,"Open this door, now!"
1103,6,4,Stan Marsh,[pushing his dresser into place against the door] Kiss my ass!
1104,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh Jeez, he said ""ass"" to his parents."
1105,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You're getting in pretty deep, dude. [Stan glares back with a look of determination]"
1106,6,4,Sharon,"I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person."
1107,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back."
1108,6,4,Sharon,"I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life."
1109,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?"
1110,6,4,Officer Barbrady,Me?? How did I get into this mess?
1111,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,So what happens now?
1112,6,4,Stan Marsh,"I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing."
1113,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We're with you, dude."
1114,6,4,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
1115,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[serious] Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now."
1116,6,4,Eric Cartman,I want out.
1117,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[glares] Shut up, Cartman."
1118,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We're with you, Stan."
1119,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to."
1120,6,4,Stan Marsh,Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
1121,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
1122,6,4,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
1123,6,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Wait-what?
1124,6,4,Sharon,"And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing."
1125,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!"
1126,6,4,Sharon,"Well excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!"
1127,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open! [the adults leave the living room and go up the stairs, stopping at Stan's door] Kyle?! [pounds on the door] This is your mother! You will open this door right now!"
1128,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,[pause] ...No I won't.
1129,6,4,Sharon,"[gets to retort] Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila. [Sheila looks at her] That was very impressive."
1130,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"[turns back to the door] Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!"
1131,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!"
1132,6,4,Sharon,[folds her arms] Very persuasive.
1133,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,[starts pounding away furiously at the door] AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!
1134,6,4,Chris,"[calms Sheila down and takes over] Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try. [faces the door] Butters? [slight zoom-in on Butters] Butters, this is your father."
1135,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[to the boys] Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?"
1136,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this."
1137,6,4,Chris,Butters? Answer me!
1138,6,4,Butters Stotch,[to the boys] But they-ah they're angry at me.
1139,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say. [begins to whisper in Butters' ear] You can tell them...
1140,6,4,Chris,Butters! Right now!
1141,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?"
1142,6,4,Chris,WHAT?!
1143,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh, sweet Jesus."
1144,6,4,Chris,[turns to the other adults] What's gotten into them?
1145,6,4,Sharon,"Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!"
1146,6,4,Stan Marsh,"This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe."
1147,6,4,Sharon,Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizzas and ice cream.
1148,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[weakening] Oh, God-damnit you guys."
1149,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, stay away from that door!"
1150,6,4,Sharon,"You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. [the adults walk away, but Sheila stops and turns back to the door.]"
1151,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,[pounds on the door once more] Mmmrragh!!
1152,6,4,Stan Marsh,[sighs] Round one is over. We made it. [the boys gather in]
1153,6,4,Eric Cartman,"We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!"
1154,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in."
1155,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"But we will have to sleep, dude."
1156,6,4,Stan Marsh,Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
1157,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[finding a way to relate] Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!"
1158,6,4,Stan Marsh,"We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! [one calf take a dump on the carpet, another walks up and takes a piss on it]"
1159,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
1160,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!"
1161,6,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food."
1162,6,4,Sharon,"Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all."
1163,6,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, all right."
1164,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
1165,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Good night, fellas!"
1166,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Good night.
1167,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[to the calves] Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity."
1168,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again."
1169,6,4,Eric Cartman,Can't go on. Need... food...
1170,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
1171,6,4,Eric Cartman,"There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf."
1172,6,4,Stan Marsh,"No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!"
1173,6,4,Eric Cartman,All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. [points]
1174,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks back at Stan] He might be right, dude."
1175,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Aw, heck. [a basket floats up to the window on a pole]"
1176,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Wait, what is that? [points to the basket. The other three boys turn. Cartman approaches the window and takes the basket] Dude!"
1177,6,4,Eric Cartman,Food!
1178,6,4,Sharon,"Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?"
1179,6,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer."
1180,6,4,Sharon,"Oh dear God, you've ruined everything."
1181,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,All right!
1182,6,4,Stan Marsh,See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
1183,6,4,Eric Cartman,Look you guys! Beef jerky!
1184,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! And fried chicken! [Stan sits at a corner with his apples.]
1185,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[sensing a lapse] Wha? [rises and walks to his bed, where the other boys sit eating]"
1186,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Mmmmm.
1187,6,4,Eric Cartman,Mmmmm.
1188,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are you guys doing?"
1189,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We're eating, dude."
1190,6,4,Stan Marsh,You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
1191,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
1192,6,4,Butters Stotch,Me neither.
1193,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy."
1194,6,4,Stan Marsh,"[returns to his corner] That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!"
1195,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Go ahead, that's more for us. [tempts the calf next to him with some beef jerky] You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry? [the calf starts chewing on it] Who's the hungry man?"
1196,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks over] Dude, that's messed up. [Stan looks as well, but goes back to his apples]"
1197,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, check this out! [a TV now sits where the football normally is, and the picture shown is that of Stan's house. The other boys join Kyle in looking at the news report from News 4]"
1198,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where four insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle."
1199,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are. [Cartman looks at him, then slugs him hard] Eugh!"
1200,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say."
1201,6,4,Craig s father,"[with wife and son] We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community. [Craig shows his right middle finger to the camera. Next, the boys' parents are shown]"
1202,6,4,Tom,"[with wife and son] We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community. [Craig shows his right middle finger to the camera. Next, the boys' parents are shown]"
1203,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh","We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!"
1204,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.
1205,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas."
1206,6,4,Stan Marsh,"No, this is exactly what we wanted."
1207,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,It is?
1208,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people."
1209,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to ""Puppies from Around the World."""
1210,6,4,Stan Marsh,[the boys are stunned] ...I don't believe it.
1211,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far."
1212,6,4,Stan Marsh,[notices the situation] Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! [Butters stirs and turns around]
1213,6,4,Butters Stotch,"[waking] Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. [voices are heard outside and the boys sit up, then move towards the window]"
1214,6,4,Voices,"We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved"
1215,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Huh, what the hell is that?"
1216,6,4,Hippies,If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.For a... brighter tomorrow...
1217,6,4,Eric Cartman,Hippies!
1218,6,4,Stan Marsh,What are they doing here?
1219,6,4,Hippie,[on bullhorn] We're with you boys! Your message is real and your voice is just. [the other hippes start cheering]
1220,6,4,Hippies,Hooray! Hooray!
1221,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
1222,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Ew, they're all dirty."
1223,6,4,Eric Cartman,"What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!"
1224,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict. [FBI vehicles speed in and FBI agents pour out of the vehicles]"
1225,6,4,Sharon,[not believing what she sees] Oh Jesus Christ. [slaps her hand to her forehead]
1226,6,4,FBI Agent,Who's in charge here?
1227,6,4,Officer Barbrady,I am. But I don't want to be.
1228,6,4,FBI Agent,Where's the negotiator?
1229,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad."
1230,6,4,FBI Agent,"All right, see what you can do."
1231,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, are you okay?"
1232,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. [lifts up his shirt to show the sores to the others]"
1233,6,4,Butters Stotch,What is that?
1234,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, maybe we should end this."
1235,6,4,Stan Marsh,No!
1236,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,Give me a hard line to the phone in that house! [a squad member gets on it]
1237,6,4,Officer Barbrady,The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out.
1238,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"[receives the phone] Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology."
1239,6,4,Stan Marsh,Hello?
1240,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you?"
1241,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Ah, hold on. [turns to the other boys] It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?"
1242,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Don't give him anything!
1243,6,4,Stan Marsh,What do I say??
1244,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Stan and takes over] Dah, give me that! [takes the receiver from Stan] Talk to me Mike."
1245,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?"
1246,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Sure, sure."
1247,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other."
1248,6,4,Eric Cartman,What do you have in mind?
1249,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Well, how about you send out one of the calves?"
1250,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike."
1251,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Just one, that's all we want."
1252,6,4,Eric Cartman,"All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -"
1253,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, no!"
1254,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! [Cartman holds out his palm to silence them]
1255,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[clears his throat] We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own."
1256,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"What? I, I can't do that."
1257,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye."
1258,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad."
1259,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work."
1260,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"[trumped] Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do."
1261,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,Okay. Up a little... left a little... [a crane lifts a box of ammunition towards Stan's window. Kyle and Butters wait for it] Almost there.
1262,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",[arrives with Sharon] What is that?
1263,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,We're giving the boys some guns in return for our calves
1264,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",What?
1265,6,4,Sharon,You're giving my baby guns?
1266,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"[snaps back] Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't! [walks off in a huff to the negotiation van] Get them on the line for me!"
1267,6,4,Eric Cartman,[answers the ringing phone] Hello.
1268,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain."
1269,6,4,Eric Cartman,"All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. [in the background, Kyle takes out the guns, tossing them to Butters]"
1270,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?"
1271,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! [Butters assembles a machine gun while Kyle inspects a sword. Stan lies by a corner in a fetal position, on a calf, with more lesions appearing on his face]"
1272,6,4,Stan Marsh,O-ogh...
1273,6,4,Eric Cartman,"We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! [Butters plays soldier in the background, moving his gun around and then saluting while Kyle practices some lunges]"
1274,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [to fellow agents as he holds his hand over the mouthpiece] Damnit, I'm losing them. [to Cartman] Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf."
1275,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! [Kyle tosses a dud grenade at Butters, who hits it with a spear. The grenade flies off the bed and onto the floor. Kyle and Butters jump with joy]"
1276,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,What do you have in mind?
1277,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"A little to the left... [this time the crane is lifting a missile] Okay, that's good. A little to the right. [Butters and Kyle wait by the window again]"
1278,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,You're giving them a missile??
1279,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"[losing patience] Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust!"
1280,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[dabbing Stan's sores with a moist towel] Stan's getting worse, you guys."
1281,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Mike, speak."
1282,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,How are we doin'?
1283,6,4,Eric Cartman,"We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?"
1284,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word ""veal"" to ""tortured baby cow."" [holds up an FDA document]"
1285,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Good, good."
1286,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.
1287,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike."
1288,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Now, now please can, can we get you to come out? [Cartman looks over at Stan, who looks sicker by the minute]"
1289,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them."
1290,6,4,Adults,Yes! All right! Woohoo!
1291,6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator."
1292,6,4,FBI Agent,They're coming out now?
1293,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico."
1294,6,4,Sharon,What??
1295,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on ""Star Trek"" to drive the truck. [beat] In full makeup."
1296,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",Jesus Christ!
1297,6,4,FBI Agent,"All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action!"
1298,6,4,FBI Negotiator Glen Dumont,"All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples."
1299,6,4,FBI Agent,"Get out of here! [Dumont bolts. The agent talks to Barbrady] We'll get them the semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy. If they see that, thay'll come out and then, we could take them."
1300,6,4,Officer Barbrady,But isn't that dishonest?
1301,6,4,FBI Agent,"Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen?"
1302,6,4,FBI Agent,All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?
1303,6,4,Michael Dorn,"[aka Worf, arrives in full makeup] I was woken up at three in the mornng, told I had to put on makeup, and come to this town. [folds his arms] What the hell is gong on?!"
1304,6,4,FBI Agent,"I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help."
1305,6,4,Michael Dorn,This is highly unusual!
1306,6,4,FBI Agent,"[on the bullhorn] All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International."
1307,6,4,Eric Cartman,And Worf?
1308,6,4,Michael Dorn,My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character called Worf.
1309,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes to Stan] Stan! It worked!
1310,6,4,Stan Marsh,[looking very weak and with a few more sores on his body] It... did?
1311,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!"
1312,6,4,Stan Marsh,Pick me up. I... I want to see. [Kyle picks him up]
1313,6,4,Eric Cartman,Step back! Tell those men to step back!
1314,6,4,FBI Agent,Do it!
1315,6,4,FBI Agents,[lowering their weapons and stepping back] Mmrrrr.
1316,6,4,Hippies,All right! Woohoo! Yeah!
1317,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[heads for the street] Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies! [approaches the semi-truck, where Michael Dorn now sits at the wheel. He gets into the passenger side and sits] Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, amd you must refer to me as ""Captain."""
1318,6,4,Michael Dorn,Where am I supposed to drive to?
1319,6,4,Eric Cartman,"No. See, must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"""
1320,6,4,Michael Dorn,"Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
1321,6,4,Eric Cartman,You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
1322,6,4,Michael Dorn,This whole thing is ridiculous!
1323,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[correcting Dorn] ""Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"""
1324,6,4,Michael Dorn,"[beat, then in a low voice] Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous. [starts up the engine]"
1325,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[calls out] Okay, all set!"
1326,6,4,News 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom."
1327,6,4,Butters Stotch,Okay Cartman!
1328,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Step on it, Mr. Worf! [the semi peels off]"
1329,6,4,Boys,All right!
1330,6,4,Butters Stotch,We're going! [Kyle grins]
1331,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Mexico here we come! [Dorn honks to clear everyone out of the way.]
1332,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!"
1333,6,4,Michael Dorn,We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!
1334,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[correcting gently] ""Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"""
1335,6,4,Michael Dorn,"Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads."
1336,6,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers."
1337,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on."
1338,6,4,FBI Agent,"Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it! [another agent presses a button and a buzzer is heard. A few seconds later balloons fill up under the semi and lift it off the ground. The whole thing comes to a stop]"
1339,6,4,Eric Cartman,"[looks out] Oh, it's a double-cross!!"
1340,6,4,FBI Agent,"[approaches with his fellow agents] Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!"
1341,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! No!!
1342,6,4,Eric Cartman,"What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!"
1343,6,4,Michael Dorn,I'm NOT killing anybody!
1344,6,4,Eric Cartman,Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
1345,6,4,Stan Marsh,"We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!"
1346,6,4,FBI Agent,"[On the bullhorn] Alright boys, just stay right there until your parents arrive."
1347,6,4,Michael Dorn,Can I go now?
1348,6,4,Officer Barbrady,"Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you"
1349,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Oh. [glances at the stack of veal forming next to him] Well, it doesn't matter now."
1350,6,4,Officer Barbrady,What you do mean?
1351,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"You see, in the six days since the word ""veal"" was officially changed to ""little tortured baby cow"" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see ""little tortured baby cow"" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'."
1352,6,4,Butters Stotch,Really?
1353,6,4,Rancher Bob Denkins,"Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life."
1354,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry! [Stan doesn't respond. He's passed out] Stan? Stan?? [Butters appears next to them]"
1355,6,4,Dr Doctor,He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.
1356,6,4,"Sharon, Shelly, and Randy Marsh",Vaginitis?
1357,6,4,Dr Doctor,"It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy."
1358,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude."
1359,6,4,Dr Doctor,We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
1360,6,4,Eric Cartman,Thank God we stopped it in time.
1361,6,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas."
1362,6,4,Butters Stotch,Hear hear.
1363,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start."
1364,6,4,Chris,I'll say!
1365,6,4,Butters Stotch,"Aw, we're still grounded?"
1366,6,4,Kyle Broflovski,"But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause."
1367,6,4,Sheila and Gerald Broflovski,"Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer."
1368,6,4,Chris,"That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms. [Sternly] But first, [softens] maybe we can grab some burgers."
1369,6,4,The Boys,All right!
1370,6,5,Stan Marsh,[pouring chips into a bowl] This is gonna be so awesome!
1371,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Do we have everything?
1372,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!"
1373,6,5,Eric Cartman,All right!
1374,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, it's almost time."
1375,6,5,Announcer,"Up next on HBC, the Russell Crowe Show!"
1376,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Alright, here we go."

We're gonna have lots of fun tuhday as we travel all around, and look for some good- [a man walks through his shot and Russell does a double-take, then goes after the man] Ay! What the hell do yuh think you're doin'?! [Russell's cameraman moves the camera to catch up with him] You walked right through my shot, mate! Do you know who I am?!"
1379,6,5,Man,"Oh, excuse me. I was just- [Russell proceeds to beat the crap out of the man] God-damned smartass! Do you think you could [Shelly comes in and takes the remote, changing the channel. She stops at the WD]"
1380,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!"
1381,6,5,Shelly Marsh,"Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy."
1382,6,5,Stan Marsh,"[rushes up to her] No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! [she switches back to HBC]"
1383,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Oh! Get up! Get up, you little pussy! [the man crawls along the dock on his belly]"
1384,6,5,Shelly Marsh,The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
1385,6,5,Russell Crowe off screen,Oh ya like that do ya?! [punches heard]
1386,6,5,Stan Marsh,"It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!"
1387,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,It's the biggest night of the year.
1388,6,5,Shelly Marsh,[switching channels again] That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!
1389,6,5,Stan Marsh,But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
1390,6,5,Shelly Marsh,"No, turds!"
1391,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?"
1392,6,5,Shelly Marsh,"Shut up, fat turd!!"
1393,6,5,Eric Cartman,"I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!"
1394,6,5,Shelly Marsh,We're not watching this! [a shot of Russell Crow and the man]
1395,6,5,Russell Crowe,Come on!
1396,6,5,Man,"Look, I apologize, but I was just--"
1397,6,5,Stan Marsh,"But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe."
1398,6,5,Shelly Marsh,"[softly, voice rising] There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!"
1399,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!"
1400,6,5,Shelly Marsh,"[glances away, then looks at Stan] All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!"
1401,6,5,Stan Marsh,"[glances down, then answers] O-K, deal."
1402,6,5,Shelly Marsh,"And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! [slaps Stan twice and walks off]"
1403,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But if looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em."
1404,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[gathers around Stan with the other boys] Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/"
1405,6,5,Butters Stotch,Ehyeah!
1406,6,5,Stan Marsh,"[somber] Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch."
1407,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,You'd miss the new trailer?
1408,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I'm not going."
1409,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? [points to Stan]"
1410,6,5,Stan Marsh,Stan.
1411,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Stan, okay. What's your name? [points to Kyle]"
1412,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Kyle.
1413,6,5,Eric Cartman,Kyle. What's your name? [looks at Butters]
1414,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?"
1415,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break."
1416,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break."
1417,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. [heads for the door. The other three go back to the sofa]"
1418,6,5,Russell Crowe,Seems like no one else here wants to fight.
1419,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, thank God for stupid people [""...We'll have to go somewhere else...""]"
1420,6,5,Eric Cartman,Amen.
1421,6,5,Russell Crowe,"...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger?"
1422,6,5,Tugger,TOOOOOOT
1423,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Great idea! [runs up to the camera] Tugger thinks we should go to the faaar away of China. [backs up towards the tug boat] China is one of the oldest civilizations on earth. And from what I understand, they LOVE a good fight! So let's go! [rushes onto the tugboat and sets off.]"
1424,6,5,Tugger,TOOOT TOOOT [two men appear]
1425,6,5,Man with Mustache,Oh my God! It's Russell Crowe!
1426,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[taunts back] Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe! Oh my Gmah, bah bah byah byah! [gets out and head for the two men] Why don't you mind your own business, you scrotum?! [punches each of them. Cut to a sailing Tugger]
Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world."
1427,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?"
1428,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[at the wheel] What a glorious day to spend a way, fight-in' round the world. [whistles and spins the boat's wheel]"
1429,6,5,Eric Cartman,"What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. [takes a hold of the remote]"
1430,6,5,Stan Marsh,They look fine to me. [another shot of Russell sailing away]
1431,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Just don't mess with it, Cartman."
1432,6,5,Eric Cartman,"[leaves the sofa] Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. [heads for the television]"
1433,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Just just leave it alone.
1434,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? [moves the cable, and the vertical goes out of whack]"
1435,6,5,Stan Marsh,That's worse!
1436,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, how about ... that? [moves it again, and the cathode ray tube pops. The wall behind the TV is blackened, and Cartman slowly peeks]"
1437,6,5,Stan Marsh,Dude!
1438,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
1439,6,5,Eric Cartman,"[panicked] It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!"
1440,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, the commercials could start any time!"
1441,6,5,Eric Cartman,I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
1442,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!"
1443,6,5,Stan Marsh,Get all the stuff! [they gather the snacks and head for the front door. Cartman opens the door and Butters arrives]
1444,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?"
1445,6,5,Stan Marsh,We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! [the three boys exit]
1446,6,5,Butters Stotch,Oh Jeez. [follows]
1447,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez"
1448,6,5,Stan Marsh,Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
1449,6,5,Eric Cartman,[gruffly] Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!
1450,6,5,A Voice,[a slow drawl] ...but the Palestinian government uh is not going to see any for future- [the front door opens and the boys run in.]
1451,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Huff, huff"
1452,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! [Kyle takes the remore and quickly changes channels, and the Russell Crowe show pops up]"
1453,6,5,Russell Crowe,And so here we are in history-rich Ch-ooina.
1454,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. [the boys sit on the sofa. Ike looks at each of them angrily]
1455,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Phew!
1456,6,5,Stan Marsh,Phew!
1457,6,5,Butters Stotch,Phew!
1458,6,5,Ike Broflovski,Hey! Imong telling Dat!
1459,6,5,Eric Cartman,[arrives breathless] Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
1460,6,5,Ike Broflovski,Dadadadat!
1461,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! [Ike drops down and walks away, Cartman sits next to Butters]"
1462,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[hiding behind a potted shrub which he carries before him. He sets it down and look at the camera] This is Tianinman Square. Lots of good foightin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93. [he turns back to the shrub and peers through it. The Chinese are pleasantly involved in conversations. Russell turns back to the camera] These chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. Let's see if we can get in for a closer look. [picks up the shrub and goes further into the crowd, then peers through the shrub. The Chinese notice him] Oi! [he looks back at the camera] I've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. You can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end. [turns to the shrub and jumps through it, grabbing a man's ankles] Gotcha mate! [the victimized man speaks first, then another man answers. Russell's head turns to see who's speaking, then he jumps up to challenge the second man] Ah, you wanna fight, huh?! [challenges the first] Think you could take me, you little buggers?! [punches the first man and the man sails to the ground a few feet away, knocked out cold. Blood pours from his nose. The man he lands in front of decides to fight, and soon Russell Crowe is punching men away left and right. A polieman arrives, and Russell knocks him away, too]"
1463,6,5,Eric Cartman,"God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? [Gerald arrives with Ike]"
1464,6,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV."
1465,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
1466,6,5,Gerald Broflovski,You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!
1467,6,5,Ike Broflovski,Etetheh bunlapala un night.
1468,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage."
1469,6,5,Gerald Broflovski,It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer
1470,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house."
1471,6,5,Stan Marsh,Aww! [the boys gather their snacks and head for the door]
1472,6,5,Eric Cartman,Argh!
1473,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, wait fellas. [the boys stop] We can't go to my house."
1474,6,5,Eric Cartman,We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
1475,6,5,Stan Marsh,"AGH! [thinks hard, then] Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! [they leave. Ike goes back to the sofa and sits, changing the channel]"
1476,6,5,Ike Broflovski,It's a burning flag.
1477,6,5,Eric Cartman,[trailing again] Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
1478,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!"
1479,6,5,Chef,"[answers the door in his nightgown] Oh. Hello there, children."
1480,6,5,The Boys,"[quickly] Hey Chef. [run for his sofa, leaving Chef at the door.]"
1481,6,5,Chef,"Uh, how's it goin'?"
1482,6,5,Chef,"[arrives] Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh? [a new HDTV with side speakers and settop cable box, and a rather large base] Pretty cool, ain't it?"
1483,6,5,Stan Marsh,"[impatient] Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?"
1484,6,5,Chef,"Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle. [Chef takes the remote and fiddles with it] I can't figure it out at all. [the program pops up immediately]"
1485,6,5,Russell Crowe,[in India] -bloomin' Taj Mahal.
1486,6,5,Eric Cartman,"There, you got it, you got it!"
1487,6,5,Russell Crowe,[punching the natives - hits one] Freakin' Indies [hits a second] really put up a [hits a third] fight!
1488,6,5,Stan Marsh,We made it!
1489,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, thank God."
1490,6,5,Chef,"Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure."
1491,6,5,Eric Cartman,"We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials."
1492,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[still punching Indians as they approach] Alright everyone, we're gonna take our first commercial break. But be sure not to go anywhere, because there's lot's more people to beat up!"
1493,6,5,Stan Marsh,Here they come!
1494,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Heuh, the commercials! [some commercials air, but they're not important, as little sound is heard]"
1495,6,5,Announcer,"And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!"
1496,6,5,The Boys,[disappointed] Awww!
1497,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer."
1498,6,5,Stan Marsh,I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
1499,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show."
1500,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world. [cut to Brooklyn, with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. A lot of brownstones here. Russell has brought his schrub with him again. He approaches the camera] Oi! Now Tugger's brought me to one of the greatest places for foightin' in North America. [backs up] Brooklyn, New York. Lots of minorities here, and they don't take kindly to whitey. [points to himself] Let's get a closer look. Come on, Tugger! [picks up his shrub and runs. Tugger hops after him, tooting along. They end up looking at a pickup basketball game in the shadow of some skyscrapers. Russell peers through the shrub, then turns to the camera] Looks like we got some black people, and some Puerto Ricans. [a quick peek] Notice the colorful rags on their heads, meaning they could be part of a gang, and therefore, [makes a fist] real used to fightin'. [peers through the shrub]"
1501,6,5,Black Player,"Hey, look at that guy over there. Ain't that that Gladiator guy?"
1502,6,5,Puerto Rican Player,Where?
1503,6,5,Black Player,"Behind that plant, next to that tugboat? [Russell peers through, but the shows his face]"
1504,6,5,Puerto Rican Player,"Oh yeah, I think it is."
1505,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[in condescending falsetto] Oh my God, it's the Gladiator guy! [heads for the basketball court and puts up his fists] Oh my God, I've never seen an actor before! [moves around for anyone to fight] Why don't you choke on some pig vomit, you stupid sobs!"
1506,6,5,Chef,Why can't this guy control his temper?
1507,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight? [knocks down a black player. Another one punches him in the back of the head] Crikey, you've done it now!"
1508,6,5,Eric Cartman,"This TV is great, Chef."
1509,6,5,Chef,"Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool feature, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here- [a menu pops up on a blue screen. He presses more buttons and the default choice changes, but nothing else] No, no wait. You hit this button here [ends up at clock reset function] No, that's not it. Let's see. [presses another button] Menu... [press] Function [screen properties pop up]"
1510,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. [looks like Russell is fighting Germans, but the menu windows block the view]"
1511,6,5,Chef,"Let's see. [screen resolution, manual programming, spectrum density, profiles, audio settings, and so on pop up] Aw, dammit!"
1512,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Get it back to normal, Chef!"
1513,6,5,Chef,"I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function- [still no success. The blue screen is still there] Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? [selects 'yes']"
1514,6,5,The TV,"[transforms itself into a robot] Human eradication mode, active. [it rises from its base, which becomes its feet. The side speakers re-position themselves as guns, and the cable box becomes the eyes. Chef and the boys are stunned by what they just saw. The TV turns to its right and heads for the front door. It breaks through, goes down the steps, and immediately starts firing at everything in sight.]"
1515,6,5,Stan Marsh,Oh God-dammit!
1516,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,The TV left.
1517,6,5,Butters Stotch,Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
1518,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! [the four get off the sofa and head out the door. A car screeches to a halt, and the TV fires at the driver, forcing the couple inside to flee]"
1519,6,5,Butters Stotch,Whre do we go? Where do we go?
1520,6,5,Stan Marsh,The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
1521,6,5,Eric Cartman,Aagh! God-dammit!
1522,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[back in Brooklyn, amid the bunch of beat-up basketball players] You fight like Norwegians, ya fairies!"
1523,6,5,The Boys,Phew!
1524,6,5,Stan Marsh,We made it.
1525,6,5,Eric Cartman,[blubbering] This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
1526,6,5,Russell Crowe,"These are the Florida Keys, a remote island chain just a few miles from... Oi! Wait a minute! Wasn't I just in Brooklyn fightin' minorities? What happened with that?"
1527,6,5,Tugger,Mooooot.
1528,6,5,Russell Crowe,"It's that God-damned editor! He cut the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm gonna get him!"
1529,6,5,Editor,Yeah. Oh I'm just working. I'm probably done around seven. [the door flies open and Russell stomps in there]
1530,6,5,Russell Crowe,[lifts the editor up by the collar] Who the hell do you think you are?!
1531,6,5,Editor,I'm the editor.
1532,6,5,Russell Crowe,"I know you're the bloomin' editor! I mean, who do you think you are cuttin' one of my foightin' scenes short?!"
1533,6,5,Editor,"Dude, the director said to cut it."
1534,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Moy foightin' is poetry! You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you teesticle! [drops him, pauses, then delivers three blows to the belly]"
1535,6,5,Jimbo,Well that guy's just plain nuts.
1536,6,5,Barkeep,"[rushes over] Hey hey hey, whoa, you kids can't be in here. [the kids are dumbstruck]"
1537,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
1538,6,5,Barkeep,"You ain't midgets, your lips are too full. [the boys stay silent] Now GET OUT!!"
1539,6,5,Stan Marsh,But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
1540,6,5,Barkeep,"Look, this is a bar! We can't have children in here. People come here for debauchery and sin!"
1541,6,5,Eric Cartman,Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
1542,6,5,Butters Stotch,Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
1543,6,5,Barkeep,GET OUT!!! [walks over and turns the TV to a baseball game]
1544,6,5,The Boys,Aaah!
1545,6,5,Stan Marsh,"[the first to head for the door] Come on, we gotta get to a TV! [the others follow]"
1546,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!"
1547,6,5,Chef,"Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press ""menu,"" then ""function."" [presses the buttons. The TV shoots at a man locking up a store, making him spill his groceries and fall on his back. The TV stops]"
1548,6,5,Townsman,Jesus! [gets up and runs] Waaaah! [the TV mvoes forward again]
1549,6,5,Chef,"No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no. [listens] Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?"
1550,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! [once the boys are in place, Stan walks over to the TV and turns it on. ""Puppies From Around The World"" comes on, and Stan quickly changes the channel to the Russell Crowe show]"
1551,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,We're not too late! [the boys grin]
1552,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Come on, Tugger ol' mate. Why are you lookin' so down?"
1553,6,5,Tugger,"Mooot, mooot."
1554,6,5,Russell Crowe,[whispers to the camera] Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems his girlfriend and him had a bit of a row last night.
1555,6,5,Tugger,Mooooot.
1556,6,5,Old Man,"[everyone watches silently, then] ...What is this?"
1557,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Come on. Cheer up, Tugger. How can I make you feel better? I know! [grabs a guitar  off-screen and prepares to play it.] How would you like me to sing one of the songs off me new album?"
1558,6,5,Tugger,[shakes its smokestack with each protest] Nooo! Nooooo!
1559,6,5,Russell Crowe,"What's that, Tugger? You say you really love the songs on my album?"
1560,6,5,Tugger,Noooooooooo! [shakes its smokestack]
1561,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Alright then, Tugger. [begins strumming]"
1562,6,5,Tugger,"Noo, no! [shakes its smokestack]"
1563,6,5,Russell Crowe,You know that you're my baby. You know I need you now.
1564,6,5,Tugger,"[tries to escape, but can't, as it's tied to the dock] Noooooooooo! [shakes its smokestack]"
1565,6,5,Russell Crowe,"I don't know where I'm goin', I gotta get there some, yeah gotta get there, somehow."
1566,6,5,Tugger,"[returns and tries to rip itself away towards the right with all its might] Noooooooooo! [turns and tries to pull itself away towards the left, but can't]"
1567,6,5,Russell Crowe,Gotta get there somehow.
1568,6,5,Tugger,"[continues to struggle] Noooooooooo! [turns and tries to pull itself away towards the left, but can't]"
1569,6,5,Russell Crowe,"You can stay away tonight, but I'm gonna sleep here, in my explosive clouds..."
1570,6,5,Tugger,"[returns, then takes out its arms for the first time] NOOOOO! [pulls out some giant earmuffs and places them over the cabin doors. It shakes violently as Russell lunges into a faster rhythm]"
1571,6,5,Russell Crowe,"SHOUT! Think I feel your heartbeat, can you feel mine... lady lookin' lovely, gotta take your love inside, gotta take it..."
1572,6,5,Tugger,"[struggles fiercely] NOOOOO! NOOOOO! [throws its earmuffs off, reaches for a pistol and places it against its smokestack. Tugger fires the gun, and it falls into the water with a splash. Russell stops singing once he hears the gunshot..]"
1573,6,5,Russell Crowe,[spins around] Tugger! [drops to the edge of the dock and looks down at the water. Tugger is on its side leaking oil] Tugger shot himself!
1574,6,5,Announcer,[the show logo pops up] Has Russell lost Tugger for good? Find out after these messages.
1575,6,5,Eric Cartman,Here we go!
1576,6,5,Stan Marsh,Commercial Break Number Two! [the boys are positively giddy with anticipation]
1577,6,5,Announcer,"And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!"
1578,6,5,Eric Cartman,That's it? That's all the commercials?
1579,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
1580,6,5,Stan Marsh,I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
1581,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
1582,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Tugger! Why'd you do it, Tugger?! [a doctor approaches him] Doctor! Tell me how he is, doctor!"
1583,6,5,Doctor in Russell Crowe's show,"Well, he's a very sick little tugboat."
1584,6,5,Old Man,"What is this? We wanna watch ""Puppies From Around The World."""
1585,6,5,Old Woman,Yeah. We don't like this show.
1586,6,5,Eric Cartman,Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
1587,6,5,Russell Crowe,"You gotta save him, Doc! Tugger! 'E's my best friend! The only friend in the world who would-"
1588,6,5,Doctor in Russell Crowe's show,"He's going to live, but-"
1589,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[lifts the doctor up by the collar] Oi! Don't you interrupt me, you vag-oina! I was givin' a heart-wrenchin' soliloquy about me feeling's for Tugger!"
1590,6,5,Doctor in Russell Crowe's show,Sorry.
1591,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[lets the doctor down and crosses the hall to the opposite wall] Oh, Tugger! Tugger, the world won't be as bright without ya, mate! Give it to me straight, doctor! Will Tugger live?! Tell me the truth!"
1592,6,5,Doctor in Russell Crowe's show,...Now?
1593,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Yes, now's fine."
1594,6,5,Doctor in Russell Crowe's show,"Oh. Uh, your tugboat's going to be okay. He just needs an oil change and a new steamstack."
1595,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[quickly brightens and approaches the camera] Ooo, de-lolly! D'you hear that, everybody?! Tugger's gonna be okay! D'you know what that makes me feel like doin'? Foightin'! [turns around and punches the doctor out, then punches a man on crutches out, lifts him up again, and punches him out again.]"
1596,6,5,Old Man,This show is too violent! Put the puppies back on!
1597,6,5,Old Folks at Shady Acres,Yeah!
1598,6,5,Old Woman 2,Please.
1599,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!"
1600,6,5,Old Man 2,"All right, that does it! We know how to get our way! Everyone, on the count of three, release your bowels! One! Two! [everyone farts and the boys are astonished. ]"
1601,6,5,The Boys,[bury their noses in their jackets] Awww!
1602,6,5,Eric Cartman,Eewww!
1603,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, God, it's horrible! [the boys leave and exit the comunity]"
1604,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"That'd disgusting, dude!"
1605,6,5,Eric Cartman,"God, I hate old people!"
1606,6,5,Stan Marsh,We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
1607,6,5,Butters Stotch,"I told you, we can't go to my house!"
1608,6,5,Eric Cartman,And my house is being fumigated!
1609,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!"
1610,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! [Cartman struggles to keep up, blubbering all the while]"
1611,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Crikey! Ol' Tugger looks healthy, happy, and [does a catcall] fit as a whistle!"
1612,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"It's okay, it's still the show."
1613,6,5,Russell Crowe,"But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide made me realize that I should take up a cause. Most great actors take up causes, and I'm the greatest of 'em all! So, from now on i'm gonna spend all my spare time ...fighting cancer. [gets into a fighting stance] Right! Where is that pussy cancer anyway?!"
1614,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it."
1615,6,5,Stan Marsh,Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
1616,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Will your sister let us watch it?
1617,6,5,Stan Marsh,She has to! [leads the boys out of Cartman's house]
1618,6,5,Stan Marsh,Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
1619,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh..."
1620,6,5,Eric Cartman,"[trailing the other three] Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me! [stops] Oh! I lost a doughnut! [turns around and heads back] Oooh! Oh oh! [stops] Oh my God! [turns around and tries to catch up with the others] Leave no doughnut behind!"
1621,6,5,Butters Stotch,Oh Jesus! Wait.
1622,6,5,Stan Marsh,What?
1623,6,5,Butters Stotch,"I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. [the boys are scared now. Slowly, Stan reaches up for the knob and turns it. The door flies open and a torrent of blood gushes through the door, flooding the boys back into the street.]"
1624,6,5,The Boys,"AAAAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh. [Kyle shakes the blood off, Stan looks up and then at the front door, Butters sits up. A trail of blood is left from the interior of the house to the street, and Shelly looks out from her window]"
1625,6,5,Shelly Marsh,"I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!"
1626,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Look! Crack addicts with a television! [two men and a woman are shown watching a small TV on a box near some buildings. The boys walk up to them and watch the TV as well]
1627,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Well, we couldn't find cancer, but we found a man with cancer. [he walks off and pulls in an old frail man with cancer, then delivers a blow] Take that, cancer! And that! [punches the old man again]"
1628,6,5,Tugger,Mooot Mooot! [Russell punches the old man behind the head and sends him to the floor]
1629,6,5,Stan Marsh,"The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! [two phaser blasts are seen. One kills the bearded crack addict, another knocks a trash can over. Chef's TV appears and the two remaining addicts and the boys scream]"
1630,6,5,All,"AAAAA! [quickly move away. Chef's TV delivers a double blast to the small TV and destroys it, then moves off to its left.]"
1631,6,5,Chef,"[still following the TV and talking to customer service] ...Yes, I pressed ""menu"" three times! [listens] No! It's givin' me the same error message! [listens] Yes I read the instruction manual!"
1632,6,5,The Boys,[stopping] Where do we go?!
1633,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
1634,6,5,Stan Marsh,"We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??"
1635,6,5,Butters Stotch,I'm sure! There's no way!
1636,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Well why not?!
1637,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter."
1638,6,5,Eric Cartman,"[glares at Butters and slowly gets angry] Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!"
1639,6,5,Butters Stotch,No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
1640,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
1641,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! [they run off]"
1642,6,5,The Boys,AAAAA!!
1643,6,5,Eric Cartman,"The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! [Stan is the first to reach the remote control, so he takes it and turn on the TV]"
1644,6,5,Russell Crowe,"And so we'll be right back, after these commercials."
1645,6,5,Stan Marsh,We made it! [grins]
1646,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,The last commercial break is starting!
1647,6,5,Announcer,[the show logo appears] Don't go anywhere. Russell Crowe will be right back after a few more commercials. [the grins slowly fade to disappointment]
1648,6,5,Eric Cartman,These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
1649,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??"
1650,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
1651,6,5,Butters Stotch,They have to show it! They promised they would!
1652,6,5,Eric Cartman,"You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest."
1653,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
1654,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Wait a minute! Look! [points and reads from the TV] ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it!"
1655,6,5,Announcer,[Terrance & Phillip stand back to back. The camera starts with their legs and pans up] Coming this summer! The greatest Canadian duo of all time is back.
1656,6,5,Eric Cartman,[tosses his popcorn into the air] Woohoo!!! [the popcrn showers all the boys as they begin to move around happily]
1657,6,5,Stan Marsh,Yeeeeesss! [begins dancing]
1658,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,Yeeeeesss! [begins dancing]
1659,6,5,Butters Stotch,Yeeeeesss! [begins dancing]
1660,6,5,Stan Marsh,That looks AWEsome! [Cartman goes to the phone and starting dialing a number]
1661,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,They were wearing cowboy hats! [to Stan] Did you see?? [to Butters] Did you see?? [Butters stops dancing]
1662,6,5,Eric Cartman,"[on the phone] Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that? [Stan jumps up on the sofa alongside Cartman] Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too."
1663,6,5,Butters Stotch,"Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! [picks up some popcorn and toses it up into the air]"
1664,6,5,Eric Cartman,"You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see."
1665,6,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude, let's go!"
1666,6,5,Butters Stotch,Yeah. [the kids head for the front door]
1667,6,5,Kyle Broflovski,"It looks even better than their first movie, huh?"
1668,6,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it sure does!"
1669,6,5,Stan Marsh,I wonder if it's all a western?
1670,6,5,Butters Stotch,How far away is June?
1671,6,5,Russell Crowe,"Well, we sure had a good time today, didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen, a few peckers, and a lot of Colombians, to name just a few. But I sure am glad we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you? [a wallaby hops into view]"
1672,6,5,Wally B,"I'm glad to be back, Russey! [a woman and girl walk by, but stop and look]"
1673,6,5,A Girl,"Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe!"
1674,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[in the condescending falsetto] Oh my God it's Russell Crowe! Oh my bluh blah bluh!! [gets into his fighting stance] Why don't you flush yourself down a toilet, you cu- [the girl's mother picks her up and hurries away]"
1675,6,5,Tugger,Mooo-oooo.
1676,6,5,Russell Crowe,"[puts his hand to his ear and gasps] Uh-oh, Tugger's whistle. You know what that means!
[the wallaby hops to the boat as Russell backs away from the camera. He begins to sing as Wally B. turns around...]
Tugger's whistle's blowin' 
Means we must be goin' 
No more Russell Crowein' for you.
[does some boxing moves and then hops into the boat]
But now don't you start to whine
I'll see ya again next time.
 'Cause there's plenty a-more a-fightin' left to do.
[Wally B. hops closer, and finally into Russell's arms. Next shot, a departing Tugger, headed for the sunset. Russell appears and sings the signature line, slowing with every word]
Makin' movies, makin' songs, an' fightin' round the world.
See you next time, everybody!
[waves to the camera]"
1677,6,5,Chef,"So I'm supposed to press ""menu,"" then ""function,"" then ""enter."""
1678,6,6,Stan Marsh,"[turns to the boys] Okay, here he comes. [join Cartman and Kyle]"
1679,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Who wants to tell him?
1680,6,6,Eric Cartman,I'll do it.
1681,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[joining the three] Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go."
1682,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters, could you take a seat, please?"
1683,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Wuh well, sure. [They all go before Cartman's desk. Cartman takes a seat behind the desk. Stan helps Butters to his seat, then takes a place at Cartman's right side Kyle is on Cartman's left.]"
1684,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation."
1685,6,6,Butters Stotch,Wull what is it?
1686,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."" [wiggles the index and middle fingers of each hand as a quote gesture]"
1687,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend."
1688,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out."
1689,6,6,Butters Stotch,Not working out?
1690,6,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo..."
1691,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Lame
1692,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Lame, yes."
1693,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Well, but ah I can get better."
1694,6,6,Stan Marsh,"Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere."
1695,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were."
1696,6,6,Butters Stotch,Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
1697,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well, we weren't."
1698,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Please, fellas, uh don't fire me."
1699,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"We're sorry, Butters. [Cartman leaves his chair and approaches Butters] Our mind is made up."
1700,6,6,Eric Cartman,"[shakes Butters' left hand] But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by. [points to the door] You know the way out, right? [Butters look at the other two boys, who each returns a somber look. He gets off the chair, looks once more, then walks away dejectedly]"
1701,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Phew.
1702,6,6,Stan Marsh,Phew.
1703,6,6,Eric Cartman,Phew.
1704,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think."
1705,6,6,Eric Cartman,Who cares?
1706,6,6,Stan Marsh,"All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place."
1707,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[angrily] The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them. [turns around and sits on his bed, wistfully] And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others. [the shadow on the wall turns into that of an old humpbacked man] Fine! [hops off the bed determined to do something about it] If I am to be an outcast, so be it! [walks towards the camera] I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it! [moves to his left] From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me! [an image of a nuclear blast going off as people run from it] I will become the greatest supervillain [people run as danger comes from the sky] the world has ever seen! [a tsunami takes over a harbor town as a woman and baby flee it] Where I go, destruction will follow! [exults at his new destiny, raising arms and face towards heaven as lightning strikes. A shot of the exterior with more lightning]"
1708,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! [grins devilishly]"
1709,6,6,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"[knocking on Butters' door] Butters, time for bed."
1710,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Hu-uh, okay Mom. [waits a few moments, then gets that devilish look again.] Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now. [turns and faces the camera out side once more] Tomorrow, the chaos begins. [begins to laugh softly, then harder, than more maniacally, then in full maniacal laughter]"
1711,6,6,Eric Cartman,"[takes the mic] All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout. [camera pans across the seated kids, then back to Cartman] Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?"
1712,6,6,Clyde Donovan,[after a moment of silence] ...What if we don't want to be your friend?
1713,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Clyde... [mouths something]... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee."
1714,6,6,Bennigan s Chef,"Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order twenty-four is up. [presses down on a bell twice.]"
1715,6,6,Man 1,"Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minnestrone."
1716,6,6,Man 2,"Yeah, I had the minnestrone over here. [Butters laughs at his own cleverness. The diners look at him]"
1717,6,6,Butters Stotch,"I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! [cackles once again and runs out of the restaurant. The diners resume their eating after a few seconds.]"
1718,6,6,Stan Marsh,[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends. [cut to Stan seated on a green sofa under a spotlight] It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
1719,6,6,Eric Cartman,"[on a blue sofa] I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. [cut to Jimmy entertaining Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, Clyde, and Craig]"
1720,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,"[cut to Jimmy on a dark green sofa] Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?"
1721,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,[seated on a cyan sofa] Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
1722,6,6,Tweek Tweak,"[sipping coffee, shaking violently] What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!"
1723,6,6,DogPoo Petuski,"[a shot of the kids on the mine track ride, DogPoo in front with Cartman. Cut to the dirty boy who resembles Pigpen seated on a red sofa] I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything."
1724,6,6,Eric Cartman,"...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. [takes a sip of ZOOP soda]"
1725,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[a shot of Kyle, Cartman, Tweek, and Towelie in a spinning teacup] Towelie is a tough choice because, [cut to Kyle talking] even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high."
1726,6,6,Towelie,"[17 in towel years] Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on."
1727,6,6,Eric Cartman,"We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride. [cut to the log ride] The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line. [the boys are escorted to the first car, cut back to Cartman] That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and..."
1728,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,"[back at the ride. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman climb into the log] Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas."
1729,6,6,Ride Operator,O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.
1730,6,6,Eric Cartman,"[the boys look at Jimmy] Oh, really? [turns to his note pad] That's gonna cost some points. [writes down some numbers as Jimmy is helped into the log.]"
1731,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[on the sofa] But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes."
1732,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,"[cut to log ride. The boys are about to slide down the track] Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?"
1733,6,6,Stan Marsh,[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
1734,6,6,Butters Stotch,Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! [the dog slowly kneels and Butters walks off cackling at his success]
1735,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos! [walks up to his dresser drawer and messes up some shirts in there, then closes the drawer and laughs] And that's only the beginning! [laughs evilly]"
1736,6,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten. [Kyle goes off to get the box of roses] If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out. [Kyle returns with the roses and sets them down] Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?"
1737,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[holds up a rose for every kid he calls] Token. [Token approaches, gets his rose and goes back to his seat] Clyde. [Clyde goes for his rose] Craig [Craig goes for his rose] Timmy"
1738,6,6,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [goes for his rose]
1739,6,6,Tweek Tweak,Oh man! This is too much pressure!
1740,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Pip [Pip smiles and goes for his rose] Jimmy [Jimmy goes for his rose] Jason [a new boy with high forehead, goes for his rose] Towelie [Towelie goes for his rose] Luigi [Luigi goes for his rose]."
1741,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?"
1742,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Tweek.
1743,6,6,Tweek Tweak,Aaarr! [goes for his rose]
1744,6,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! [the others moan and leave their seats]"
1745,6,6,DogPoo,"[incredulous] I didn't make the cut?? Oh God, I didn't make the cut??"
1746,6,6,Dougie,I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!
1747,6,6,Stan Marsh,"All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny. [the camera pans over the remaining candidates] Good luck."
1748,6,6,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Good morning, Butters."
1749,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[takes a a seat at the table] It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's."
1750,6,6,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"No, [Butters blanches] I didn't hear about that."
1751,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeh, you didn't? [leaves his seat and walks to the living room]"
1752,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?"
1753,6,6,Chris,"[lowers the newspaper] Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. [hands the paper to Butters, who sets it down on the floor and looks for headlines. The front page doesn't offer any he's looking for, so he turns the page.]"
1754,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[getting mad] Nothing. [turns the next page] Nothing! [closes the paper and stands up] It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch! [makes two fists signaling his stepped-up efforts]"
1755,6,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, next? [signals for Craig to leave. Craig walks away and Token comes in to take his place. Scene music plays. A few moments for the boys to get a feel for Token]"
1756,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,This looks pretty good.
1757,6,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's not bad. Next? [Signals for Token to leave. Token walks away and Timmy rides in to take his place. Scene music plays.]"
1758,6,6,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
1759,6,6,Eric Cartman,Next?
1760,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody."
1761,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"[entering] Sit down, boys."
1762,6,6,Eric Cartman,Alrighty then. [the boys take their seats]
1763,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard? [a shot of the class, then of Butters. A sneer comes to his face as he laughs to himself. The room darkens around him and a shadow appears on the lower part of his face] It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? [the kids drop from their seats and look around. The sneer is back on Butters' face and the shadow returns]"
1764,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[thinking] Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth. [a shot of Butters using a shovel to bury the eraser] And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser. [Butters' desk moves around so the camera can see the kids looking for the eraser] And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! [the times table floats behind Butters and gets all jumbled up as he speaks, finally ending in a kid whose brains blow out of his head]"
1765,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk. [opens a drawer, takes out an eraser and erases the times table on the board] Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five."
1766,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[thwarted, begins to think again. The people around him take on their picture-negative counterparts] So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!"
1767,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five."
1768,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Ms. Choksondik,"
1769,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"[turns around] What is it, Butters?"
1770,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad."
1771,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go. [Butters gets off his seat and heads for the door. He takes the pass from the pegboard] Okay, so for instance, children-"
1772,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[opens the door, then looks back] Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be."
1773,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"Just go, Butters. [Butters smiles and leaves] Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?"
1774,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Uh, what's the question again?"
1775,6,6,Ms Choksondik,[holds out the five fingers on her right hand] Five... times... [holds out the index finger on her left hand] one.
1776,6,6,Eric Cartman,Five times one is of course...
1777,6,6,The Class,"[minus Cartman, Stan, and Kyle] Five."
1778,6,6,Eric Cartman,Five. [the door opens and Professor Chaos appears]
1779,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[enters cackling] The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! [approaches Ms. Choksondik]"
1780,6,6,Ms Choksondik,Who are you?
1781,6,6,Butters Stotch,"I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! [turns, takes the other eraser, and walks out cackling, closing the door. The class just looks at the door]"
1782,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"Hey! That kid took my last eraser! [heads for the door] Come back here, kid! [as she reaches the door, it opens and Butters enters]"
1783,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there."
1784,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?"
1785,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow. [raises his right elbow] Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look. [as Ms. Choksondik looks at the elbow, the shadow and sneer return to Butters' face. He begins to think] Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail."
1786,6,6,Ms Choksondik,"It looks fine, Butters. [rises and addresses the class] Okay, hold on and stay here, children. [leaves the classroom. Butters sneers again]"
1787,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You're such a fatass, Cartman!"
1788,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!"
1789,6,6,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, fatass! [silence. They look at Craig and the anger fades from their faces as they wait for him to respond]"
1790,6,6,Craig Tucker,"Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb."
1791,6,6,Eric Cartman,"[escorts Craig away] Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. [Craig leaves]"
1792,6,6,Butters Stotch,"It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world. [puts glue on some aluminum, puts the aluminum on a hamster] There we go. [the hamsters will be armored, as he is. He places the hamster back in the cage] Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos. [the hamsters begin to make noise] Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon. [the door opens and Butters quickly throws a blanket over his hamster cage] Aaahhh!"
1793,6,6,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"[Linda walks in and towards his desk] Butters, a note for you was left on the front door."
1794,6,6,Butters Stotch,A note?
1795,6,6,Stephen and Linda Stotch,Here you go. [gives it to him and walks out] And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS [exits and closes the door]
1796,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Okay, Mom. [takes a look at the envelope, spins around in his chair, and opens the envelope. He reads the letter within: ""I know who you are. The South Park Docks. 7:30. Tonight""] So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions! [pulls off the blanket] We haven't much time!"
1797,6,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?"
1798,6,6,Pip Pirrup,They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.
1799,6,6,Tweek Tweak,O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!
1800,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[as before, holds up a rose for every name] Token."
1801,6,6,Token Black,All right! [goes for his rose]
1802,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Timmy.
1803,6,6,Timmy Burch,Timmay! [goes for his rose]
1804,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Tweek. [Tweek goes for his rose] Pip
1805,6,6,Pip Pirrup,Really? I don't believe it. [goes for his rose]
1806,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Towelie.
1807,6,6,Towelie,What?
1808,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Just one more rose, Kyle."
1809,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Jimmy.
1810,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,Oh boy! Oh thank God! [goes for his rose]
1811,6,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! [Craig, Clyde, Jason, and Luigi leave]"
1812,6,6,Clyde Donovan,[turns and looks at Cartman] This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
1813,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!"
1814,6,6,Dougie,[steps out] Hey Butters.
1815,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[drops his guard and steps out] Oh, hey Dougie. [gets into character] Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos."
1816,6,6,Dougie,I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
1817,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise! [pulls out two hamsters from his pockets and sets them down] Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down! [the hamsters head back towards shore] Aw minions, naw, not that way. He- [turns to see them leave] come back minions."
1818,6,6,Dougie,"I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you."
1819,6,6,Butters Stotch,Join me?
1820,6,6,Dougie,Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
1821,6,6,Butters Stotch,But why?
1822,6,6,Dougie,"[approaching] I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing."
1823,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red."
1824,6,6,Dougie,"Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?"
1825,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray."
1826,6,6,Dougie,General Disarray.
1827,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Now let us go look for my minions! [softly] They ran away here, now to find 'em... [the new villainous duo search the docks for the hamsters]"
1828,6,6,Eric Cartman,[a shot of him on a sofa] The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. [a shot of the three boys making comments during judging. Cartman takes notes]
1829,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,"[on a sofa] Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine. [cut to Cartman's house den for the competition. Jimmy's doing his comedy routine] Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh... [a shot of the three boys getting bored] A guy walks into a guy walks into a [goes into a sing-song mode] babuh ba-a-a, uh- [next, Towelie playing an electric guitar - ""Stairway To Heaven"" - but messes up]"
1830,6,6,Towelie,"Okay wait... [starts over, but messes up. The boys are bored again] No, no wait. [tries again]"
1831,6,6,Eric Cartman,Next please.
1832,6,6,Token Black,"[takes the mic] Well, what am I supposed to do?"
1833,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Anything that'll impress us, Token."
1834,6,6,Eric Cartman,"If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?"
1835,6,6,Token Black,"Aaaah. Oh, I know. [takes his shirt and ties it into a knot between his breasts, then begins to shake his butt, giving the impression of a hula girl]"
1836,6,6,Eric Cartman,Very nice. [takes notes]
1837,6,6,Stan Marsh,I like it. [takes notes]
1838,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[back to recap] Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there."
1839,6,6,Announcer,"There goes a hit to left field, and Foley's going to score."
1840,6,6,All,Woohoo!
1841,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! Isn't this great?!
1842,6,6,Vendor,"[making his way down the steps] Kids, get your drinks here."
1843,6,6,Pip Pirrup,"Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?"
1844,6,6,Eric Cartman,"You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!"
1845,6,6,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then."
1846,6,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! [Pip leaves his seat and Token comes in]"
1847,6,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, let's try this. [a shot of the field. The Jumbotron at center field loses focus and glimpses of Professor Chaos are seen]"
1848,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?"
1849,6,6,Butters Stotch,"People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos, [Dougie comes into view] and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!"
1850,6,6,Man 3,Flood the world?
1851,6,6,Man 4,My God!
1852,6,6,Woman,"[grabs onto someone] I don't wanna die, [screams] I DON'T WANNA DIE!"
1853,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth! [Dougie goes to the faucet by the porch and turns it on, then brings the hose to Butters. Butters addresses the world] You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! [points at the pool of water now forming on the ground. The crowd watches in silence]"
1854,6,6,Man 5,"Jesus Christ, who will save us?"
1855,6,6,Man 6,"We have very little time to live. How, how shall we spend our last hours on earth? [the crowd stops and reflects...]"
1856,6,6,Fans,Yeah! All right! [everyone takes off their clothes and celebrates in their underwear]
1857,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle! [the two of them watch the hose yield its water, seemingly slowly] Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? [Dougie goes to look, then returns]"
1858,6,6,Dougie,It's on all the way.
1859,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die! [cackles and dances around, then resumes watching the puddle grow. Day fades to night] Boy, this sure is takin' a long time."
1860,6,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? [holds up Towelie's picture]"
1861,6,6,Eric Cartman,I think Towelie is awesome.
1862,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything."
1863,6,6,Stan Marsh,"[weary] Oh, this is giving me a headache."
1864,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Eh now, [pounds the table with his fist] come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on."
1865,6,6,Stan Marsh,"[acquiescing] You're right. Well now, how about Timmy? [holds up Timmy's picture] He's quiet and he takes direction well."
1866,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered."
1867,6,6,Stan Marsh,How about Token? [holds up Token's picture]
1868,6,6,Eric Cartman,Token's a smartass.
1869,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,So? You're a smartass!
1870,6,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Do we really need another one?
1871,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Good point. [Stan sets the picture down. A door opens]
1872,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,[approaches the table] Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
1873,6,6,Eric Cartman,"[disgusted] Oh, thanks Jimmy"
1874,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,"There's some chocolates and lih-liquorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside."
1875,6,6,Stan Marsh,That's great.
1876,6,6,Kyle Broflovski,Cool.
1877,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later. [leaves]"
1878,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Alright Jimmy, see ya. [the door closes]"
1879,6,6,Stan Marsh,Suckup.
1880,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete."
1881,6,6,Dougie,"Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?"
1882,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer. [the sound of vehicles screeching to a stop outside the yard] Hey, who is that? [on the street, two Water Department vans come to a stop. Four men, two from each van, step out and get their tools. They enter the yard and approach the hose]"
1883,6,6,Worker 1,Is this it?
1884,6,6,Worker 2,"Yeah, two thirteen, that's the one. [Worker 1 proceeds to close the faucet]"
1885,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Heeyyy, what are you doin'? [Worker 1 finishes and the workers leave, climb into their vans, and drive off. Professor Chaos and General Disarray look on in sad disbelief. Suddenly, Butters flares up] Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!"
1886,6,6,Dougie,What do we do now?
1887,6,6,Butters Stotch,"[softly, pensive] Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but- [with anger growing] but now they have left me with no other choice!"
1888,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. [the camera pans across the audience, showing the candidates close-up]"
1889,6,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please. [Timmy just grins. Kyle draws the last rose from the box.]"
1890,6,6,Eric Cartman,"Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? [another shot of the candidates]"
1891,6,6,Butters Stotch,"This is, General Disarray. My final solution. [cut to a view of the town from said hill. ]"
1892,6,6,Dougie,"[catches up] What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?"
1893,6,6,Butters Stotch,"Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays! [reaches into the box and withdraws a spray can] Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos! [begins spraying away. The can empties without discernible effect, and Butters tosses it down] Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. [Dougie reaches in the box and takes out three cans. He gives one to Butters and keeps the other two. Butters quickly opens the can and sprays away, cackling all the while. Dougie opens his two cans and begins spraying as well, cackling along with Butters. The camera begins to zoom out]"
1894,6,6,Announcer,"Will Professor Chaos's latest plot succeed and be the final undoing of Earth? [a shot of Stan, Cartman, Kyle, and the fourth boy under a blanket, all in Stan's living room] And which boy has been chosen to be the replacement for Kenny? [six adults are then shown: Chef, Mr. Garrison, Jimbo, Officer Barbrady, Ms. Choksondik, and Mayor McDaniels] And which of these six South Park residents was killed, and will never be seen again? [a question mark appears on screen] The answer to those questions will be answered... right now. [A final shot of Butters and Dougie with ten spent cans and three in use] No. [Stan's living room: the blanket comes off the fourth boy] Tweek. [on the street, in front of a house: Ms. Choksondik is on a gurney as paramedics cover her body with a blanket] Ms. Choksondik."
1895,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. [Tweek moves forward, but then backs up. Stan rises and turns to Tweek]"
1896,6,7,Tweek Tweak,I can't. [presents the carrot] You do it.
1897,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Just stick it on.
1898,6,7,Tweek Tweak,But what if I put it in the wrong place?
1899,6,7,Stan Marsh,Just put it between his eyes.
1900,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?"
1901,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?"
1902,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
1903,6,7,Butters Stotch,"[happens by and waves] Hey, fellas."
1904,6,7,Stan Marsh,"[flatly] Oh, hey Butters."
1905,6,7,Butters Stotch,How are things... going with your new best friend?
1906,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to Tweek] Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! [takes the carrot from Tweek's hand]"
1907,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Arrrr!
1908,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters."
1909,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
1910,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. [takes his leave, screen left. Stan and Kyle resume work on the snowman]"
1911,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! [Kyle puts the carrot in place]"
1912,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[off screen. Stan and Kyle look] You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! [excited, he rushes up and stands between then, holding an ad]"
1913,6,7,Stan Marsh,Uh oh.
1914,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!"
1915,6,7,Tweek Tweak,It's not?
1916,6,7,Eric Cartman,"No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!"
1917,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,No way.
1918,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Look! [the boys draw close. The ad is shown] Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff."
1919,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Nuh uh.
1920,6,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
1921,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,No way.
1922,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[shows irritation] Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on. [turns to Stan and Tweek and continues excitedly] Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!"
1923,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. [Cartman's smile vanishes and he shuts his eyes.]
1924,6,7,Eric Cartman,"If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!"
1925,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Alright, I'll chip in."
1926,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Gah! Me too.
1927,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[resigned] Ah, alright."
1928,6,7,Linda Stotch,Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
1929,6,7,Butters Stotch,"[in the doorway] Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework. [he enters and closes the door behind him. His evil face shows] Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT... [runs to his closet and opens the sliding door, then steps inside] nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside... [slides the door shut and changes clothes. He slides the door open and comes out dressed as] Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! [runs to his window, opens it, and jumps out. He skulks through the woods nearby with an easel. He reaches a clearing and sets up the easel. General Disarray shows up pulling a wagon of firewood]"
1930,6,7,Dougie,Professor Chaos!
1931,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray."
1932,6,7,Dougie,I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
1933,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. [EVIL PLOT #4-B]"
1934,6,7,Dougie,What dastardly deed are we doing now?
1935,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Simple, my dear general. [flips the page over to show a drawing of the town with a huge shade over the town, held up by a tall pillar] We are going to block out the sun!"
1936,6,7,Dougie,[looking at the picture] Oh. [turns around]
1937,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide [a hamster peers from the wood and drops back down again], precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow."
1938,6,7,Dougie,"Oh, awesome!"
1939,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! [laughs with evil glee]"
1940,6,7,Dougie,Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. [Butters stops laughing and freezes in place]
1941,6,7,Butters Stotch,[tilts his head forward] Huh?
1942,6,7,Dougie,They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
1943,6,7,Butters Stotch,"He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original."
1944,6,7,Dougie,So how do we build it?
1945,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Aww, I don't wanna do it now [drops his hammer], not if they already did it on the Simpsons. [walks off dejected] I have to think of something else. [they walk through the woods] Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?"
1946,6,7,Eric Cartman,Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow... [bubbles appear as Cartman dreams] Yesss... Yeesss...
1947,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[shown floating down to the briny deep. Two pairs of sea arms catch him. The sea couple rights him and walk with him in the middle]
Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
[the sea couple and he sail by in a tiny pirate ship. They take him into the castle]
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
[A sea man pitches to Cartman, who bats the ball for a run. As a sea family looks on he blows out the candles on a cake.]
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
[he rides a sea horse alongside sea people on horseback and grins at the camera]
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
[Shown walking with the sea couple again.]
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys."
1948,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people. [closes his eyes and turns to his left side] Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. [goes to sleep]"
1949,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says [slowing down to read] ""Step 2. [grabs a small sack] Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly."" [smiles, then remembers something. He turns to face the other boys] Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?"
1950,6,7,Stan Marsh,Ready. Let's see 'em.
1951,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[turns to the tank] Hold the sign up, Kyle! [Kyle picks a sign up off the floor and holds it to his chest] Higher, Kyle! [Kyle raises it higher, in front of his face] Okay. [opens the egg sack and whispers] Here we go. [pours the eggs into the tank and taps the bag for good measure. Kyle moves the sign a bit so he could peek. Cartman grins again in anticipation, but it fades. Kyle lowers the sign to his chest. Cartman looks from various angles, then takes out the magnifying glass for a closer look. Two pale shrimp crawl around in the tank. Kyle drops the sign]"
1952,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Are they playing basketball? [Cartman picks up the box and looks at the front. A close-up of a sea couple. Cartman looks in the tank and sees just shrimp. He looks displeased, Kyle has the sign in hand again]"
1953,6,7,Eric Cartman,What the fuck is this?! [Stan approaches and looks in the tank]
1954,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish."
1955,6,7,Eric Cartman,I got RIPPED OFF! [pounds the desk and sets the box on the floor to his left]
1956,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I told you, Cartman."
1957,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[approaches Kyle and confronts him] Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!! [moves on to Tweek] And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!! [his rant ended, he walks across the room] They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep"
1958,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"[shaking] They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!"
1959,6,7,Stan Marsh,What are we gonna do with them?
1960,6,7,Eric Cartman,[at the window] Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
1961,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,[approaches the tank] Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
1962,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that'd be funny."
1963,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[brightly] Heheh, okay, okay."
1964,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!"
1965,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"[blurts out] Jesus Christ, we killed her!"
1966,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[rushes to Tweek and covers his mouth] Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!"
1967,6,7,Butters Stotch,"General Disarray, are your parents home?"
1968,6,7,Dougie,No.
1969,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date."
1970,6,7,Dougie,What?
1971,6,7,Butters Stotch,"You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head! [pulls the cover off and laughs maniacally] Hahahahaa, yeah!"
1972,6,7,Dougie,"Oh, uh..."
1973,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! [turns on the TV]"
1974,6,7,News Anchor,"... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger. [the image in the small box changes from Hillary to that of the decapitated statue] Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square."
1975,6,7,Butters Stotch,Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
1976,6,7,News Anchor,The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads.
1977,6,7,Butters Stotch,"I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!"
1978,6,7,News Anchor,"This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson [a picture of him appears in the box] took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say:"
1979,6,7,Man 1,"Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons. [laughs] Heh, I think it's great."
1980,6,7,Woman,"Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh."
1981,6,7,Man 2,"Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching."
1982,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch."
1983,6,7,News Anchor,"The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day."
1984,6,7,Butters Stotch,Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
1985,6,7,Dougie,"You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out."
1986,6,7,Butters Stotch,[walks away hanging his head] Stupid Simpsons...
1987,6,7,Terrance,"Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something"
1988,6,7,Phillip,"Oh, what is it? [Terrance farts and Phillip comments, but the boys talk over him]"
1989,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed."
1990,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"Jesus Christ, she's dead!!"
1991,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened."
1992,6,7,Terrance,"Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion."
1993,6,7,Phillip,"[gasps] Killing is never an accident, you dickface! [farts, and the two of them crack up]"
1994,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh jeez, change the channel."
1995,6,7,News Anchor,"And in other news, still no known cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach. [there's a pause and the boys look aghast]"
1996,6,7,Stan Marsh,"They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!"
1997,6,7,News Anchor,The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.
1998,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God!
1999,6,7,Stan Marsh,We're dead!
2000,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"Oh Jesus! [moves off the couch] That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!"
2001,6,7,Eric Cartman,Tweek! Where are you going?
2002,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!"
2003,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!"
2004,6,7,Tweek Tweak,What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
2005,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!"
2006,6,7,Eric Cartman,"In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one."
2007,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!
2008,6,7,Chef,"Oh, welll, hello there, children."
2009,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we did something kind of bad."
2010,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,We don't know who else to talk to.
2011,6,7,Chef,"Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in. [the boys enter and Chef leads them to the sofa] Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on."
2012,6,7,Stan Marsh,[pause] We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
2013,6,7,Chef,"Nowww, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?"
2014,6,7,Stan Marsh,We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
2015,6,7,Chef,"...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!"
2016,6,7,Stan Marsh,"[beat] So what should we do? [Chef thinks, then goes and pushes the sofa towards the door and onto the entry path]"
2017,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, I guess this really is a big deal."
2018,6,7,Eric Cartman,"We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves."
2019,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Gnaaahahahah! [pulls on his hair and looks at his fist] I pulled out my hair!
2020,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Wokay, how about this, Dougie? [backs up to the easel. On it is the schematic to plan #123-D] I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money. [Dougie just looks back] No?"
2021,6,7,Dougie,...Simpsons did it. The did it in episode 204.
2022,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Wokay [flips to the next page to show #124-A], then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-"
2023,6,7,Dougie,Simpsons did it!
2024,6,7,Butters Stotch,[flips to plan #129-E] I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
2025,6,7,Dougie,Simpsons did it!
2026,6,7,Stan Marsh,This is it.
2027,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime."
2028,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... ""lookout""? I won't remember ""Hammertime""!"
2029,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[whispers] Ugh. [then] Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word!"
2030,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, stupid."
2031,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, God. [the boys split up. Tweek goes to the door ajar and steps out, Kyle to a table to the right, Cartman to a table to the left, Stan to the supply closet. Cartman opens the doors under his table and looks around, then goes to Kyle's table to check out the drawers there.]"
2032,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,[takes a wide covered beaker and look in it] There's nothing here! [puts it back and Stan approaches]
2033,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's probably in her stomach. [Kyle approaches the corpse in the middle of the room and pulls back the cover. Ms. Choksondik's chest and abdomen have been cut open right down the front]"
2034,6,7,Eric Cartman,Is it her?
2035,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright."
2036,6,7,Stan Marsh,What do we do now?
2037,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach! [the boys look at him, shocked] Oh, God! You guys are such pussies! [starts digging around in the belly] Hemmm..."
2038,6,7,Tweek Tweak,[voices are heard; he rushes back in] Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme- [covers his mouth] I can't remember uh-the code word!
2039,6,7,Stan Marsh,Do you see the sea people.
2040,6,7,Eric Cartman,"No, just a bunch of goo."
2041,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"[hushed tones. Shadows appear down the hall and move towards the room] You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this."
2042,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. [covers his nose]
2043,6,7,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2044,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"[two people come down the hall] ...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!"
2045,6,7,Stan Marsh,Aaah!
2046,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Quick. Hide. [the boys disperse. Stan runs to the closet he looked in earlier, Kyle to one on the opposite side, Tweek behind the door]"
2047,6,7,Voice,"[outside] Yeah, well, at least we got Shannon Sharp back. [Cartman burrows his way into Ms. Choksondik's corpse]"
2048,6,7,Doctor 1,"Alright, let's just leave the semen sample next to the corpse; I wanna run a hair fiber test next. [snips a piece of hair off and turns around. They both walk back out]"
2049,6,7,Doctor 2,"Hey, do you smell children?"
2050,6,7,Doctor 1,"No, that's not... [voice fades. The doctors leave and the boys come out of their hiding places. Cartman is still in the corpse]"
2051,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Got it!
2052,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Let's go! [He, Kyle, and Tweek head out the door quickly. Cartman pops out of Ms. Choksondik's corpse gasping for air]"
2053,6,7,Butters Stotch,Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
2054,6,7,Dougie,Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
2055,6,7,Butters Stotch,[flips to plan #125-E] Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
2056,6,7,Dougie,"Episode 9F17 entitled ""So It's Come To This!"""
2057,6,7,Butters Stotch,[seethes for a few seconds] Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! [sits down next to Dougie]
2058,6,7,Dougie,...Simpsons did it.
2059,6,7,Butters Stotch,Dwaah!!
2060,6,7,Eric Cartman,"There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know. [looks at his hands] The blood is washed neatly from our hands. [the door opens and Chef enters with a bunch of stuff.]"
2061,6,7,Chef,"Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand [in his right hand, with a sports bag] and three hundred dollars cash [inside the suitcase in his left hand]. It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before."
2062,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[stopping Chef] It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!"
2063,6,7,Chef,"[confused] ...Wait, what? Sea people?"
2064,6,7,Stan Marsh,The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
2065,6,7,Chef,"Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning."
2066,6,7,Stan Marsh,...and then we put them back in the tank.
2067,6,7,Chef,"[drops the bag, suitcase, and tickets] Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men."
2068,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,It is?
2069,6,7,Chef,"Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else. [begins to chuckle] I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. [laughs]"
2070,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too."
2071,6,7,Chef,"Relax, children, junk that's in brine can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else."
2072,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, really?? [all four boys let out a sigh of relief]"
2073,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!
2074,6,7,Chef,"Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people. [picks up the stuff. The boys approach] Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. [the boys follow Chef out]"
2075,6,7,Stan Marsh,"[turns and waves to Cartman] Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. [turns and exits. Kyle follows]"
2076,6,7,Eric Cartman,"G'night, guys."
2077,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm so glad we're not murderers. [Cartman closes the door behind them, moves to his bed and talkes off his hat and shoes. He places his hat on a corner of the footboard and hops into bed]"
2078,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[settling in] Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. [dozes off. The camera moves to the tank to look at the tank.]"
2079,6,7,Eric Cartman,[rushes up] H'you guys! Come quick! [turns and runs off] You won't believe it!
2080,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, what now? [the boys turn left and follow]"
2081,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! [the other three approach the tank. Cartman picks up the magnifying glass for a closer look]"
2082,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa. [the close-up reveals a budding civilization with sea people building multi-story apartments and reads. The brine shrimp have begun to morph into sea people. Some of them wear clothes]
2083,6,7,Stan Marsh,Wow. How did that happen?
2084,6,7,Eric Cartman,"I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics. [brings out a small chalkboard with an equation written on it and points to the various parts of the equation] Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety."
2085,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa.
2086,6,7,Stan Marsh,They've already accomplished so much.
2087,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate."
2088,6,7,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them flourish. Tweek!"
2089,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Hr!
2090,6,7,Eric Cartman,"You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in."
2091,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Well what are you gonna do?
2092,6,7,Eric Cartman,Me? [camera closes in on him] I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
2093,6,7,Butters Stotch,"I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold! [pulls the sheet off] This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise. [grins] People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey! [begins to cackle. Dougie fiddles with the machine] You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?"
2094,6,7,Dougie,"No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that."
2095,6,7,Butters Stotch,Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
2096,6,7,Announcer,"[a commercial for Cheesy-Poofs gives way to a Simpsoons commercial] Tonight on the Simpsons: It's a laughorama when Bart builds a machine that takes cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace them instead, with mayonnaise."
2097,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Nnno [turns and faces the TV], uh no, no, it can't be."
2098,6,7,Dougie,"Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! [a shot of the TV]"
2099,6,7,Butters Stotch,No! No! [begins hallucinating]
2100,6,7,Dougie,[now looking like Bart and no longer in costume] Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
2101,6,7,Butters Stotch,Aaaaah!
2102,6,7,Dougie,"Don't have a cow, man."
2103,6,7,Butters Stotch,Oh sweet Jesus!
2104,6,7,Woman,Can I help you?
2105,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?"
2106,6,7,Woman,Your... mom told you?
2107,6,7,Eric Cartman,Do you have them or not?
2108,6,7,Woman,"We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children."
2109,6,7,Eric Cartman,What's your name?
2110,6,7,Woman,Frances Velman.
2111,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? [she looks at him and rises, moving off to her left.]"
2112,6,7,Woman,"[goes to a refrigerator and pulls out a sample] Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce. [returns to the desk and gives it to Cartman] One donor, certified, on record."
2113,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[inspecting the vial] I see, very interesting. [pulls the cap off and pours the semen onto his left hand]"
2114,6,7,Frances Velman,What are you doing?
2115,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Takin' a look here. [pulls out a portable microscope and inspects the semen between his left thumb and index finger. He stretches and squishes the semen. Frances looks on puzzled] Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five."
2116,6,7,Frances Velman,Five? Vials?
2117,6,7,Eric Cartman,"No, gallons."
2118,6,7,Frances Velman,Www-we don't have that much here.
2119,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Damint! Give me all you've got, then! [the seminal fluid slides down on his fingers]"
2120,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!"
2121,6,7,Dougie,"Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!! [Butters runs past Tom's Rhinoplasty, but stops to look at the town. It warps into Springfield; Tom's Rhinoplasty becomes Wink-E Mart]"
2122,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Waaaah! [starts to run again, and the school bus pulls up. Butters hails it down.] Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! [the door opens and Butters steps on]"
2123,6,7,Ms Crabtree,"[looking like Otto the driver, but still with bird in hair] SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!"
2124,6,7,Butters Stotch,[jumps backwards] Haaah! [ends up on his back on the sidewalk as the bus pulls away]
2125,6,7,Mr Garrison,"[looking like Smithers] Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat?"
2126,6,7,Chef,"[looking like Dr. Hibbert] Hello there, children!"
2127,6,7,Butters Stotch,[runs back the other way] Aaah! Nooo! [Chef and Garrison look at each other]
2128,6,7,Mr Garrison,...What the hell's wrong with him?
2129,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture."
2130,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.
2131,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[entering] That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?"
2132,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Uh-uh huh.
2133,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Well, drop them in! [Tweek opens the packets and drops the contents in]"
2134,6,7,Eric Cartman,And I've got the sea men. [raises a bowl of semen up to the tank and begins scooping the fluid into the tank.]
2135,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman."
2136,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley."
2137,6,7,Stan Marsh,That's cool.
2138,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh. [scoops out the last of the semen] There we go. [drops the empty bowl]"
2139,6,7,Stan Marsh,"[hands Cartman the smaller tank] Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. [Cartman takes the tank and turns it over, pouring the sea ciety into the larger tank. Screams are heard from the sea people]"
2140,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Nothin' to do now but wait.[the boys huddle around the new, larger tank.]"
2141,6,7,Stan Marsh,...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
2142,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah."
2143,6,7,Stan Marsh,Hm.
2144,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Huh.
2145,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years. [grabs his magnifier and looks at the society. It now looks Roman. He begins to speak in wonder] Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-? [spots a statue. It's one of him. Hundreds of sea people worship it] Oh. They think I'm God. [throws the magnifier away and rejoices] Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?! [runs to his window, throws the doors open and screams out] I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!! [his mom opens the door and takes some trash to the trash can next to the driveway] Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!"
2146,6,7,Liane Cartman,"[returning to the house] That's nice, poopie. [enters and closes the door]"
2147,6,7,News Anchor,"[shown as Kent Brockman] And in other South Park News, elementary school teacher Ms. Choksondik's [Simpsonized] autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor, Mr. Mackey. [also Simpsonized] However, the semen apparently did NOT contribute to the death, and so Mr. Mackey's identity is to remain anonymous. [Mackey's image becomes a silhouette and a question mark appears over it. Simpsonized Stan and Kyle enter the room.]"
2148,6,7,Stan Marsh,Hey Butters.
2149,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Butters.
2150,6,7,Butters Stotch,[spots their altered appearance] Haaa!
2151,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come."
2152,6,7,Butters Stotch,Cartman?
2153,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[arrives, shown as Nelson] Ha ha! [Butters is just stunned.]"
2154,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god."
2155,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? [Butters looks on with some trepidation]
2156,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea."
2157,6,7,Mr Garrison,"That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?"
2158,6,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever."
2159,6,7,Butters Stotch,[sensing a chance to retort] Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
2160,6,7,Eric Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?"
2161,6,7,Butters Stotch,"They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!"
2162,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[everyone is silent for a few seconds, then] ...So?"
2163,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,...Yeah. So?
2164,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?"
2165,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything."
2166,6,7,Mr Garrison,"Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons."
2167,6,7,Chef,"Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode."
2168,6,7,Butters Stotch,"Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter. [smiles. Everything before him is back in South Park-style] Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again."
2169,6,7,Chef,Good for you!
2170,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room."
2171,6,7,Butters Stotch,[heads for the door] I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! [runs out of the room. Dougie stays behind]
2172,6,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! [the others turn around to see. Shown is a statue of Tweek in progress]"
2173,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! It's Tweek.
2174,6,7,Tweek Tweak,"Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure."
2175,6,7,Eric Cartman,"That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! [small explosions are seen and the tank jumps]"
2176,6,7,Mr Garrison,What's going on now?
2177,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
2178,6,7,Tweek Tweak,Gaaa-hah!
2179,6,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Go! [two more explosions are seen]
2180,6,7,Tweek Tweak,NOW what's happening?
2181,6,7,Stan Marsh,The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
2182,6,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh God-damnit! [two missiles, one from behind each statue, fly towards the surface and back down towards their respective targets. The impacts both missiles create tear the tank apart and the sea people flood out of the tank. Screams are heard as they fall to the ground]"
2183,6,7,Eric Cartman,"[stunned, he looks and falls on his knees] Oh no! Oh the humanity!"
2184,6,7,Mr Garrison,"Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys."
2185,6,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
2186,6,7,Eric Cartman,Why can't societies just live in peace?
2187,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Parents, it's that time of year again when the bishops and priests from around the country are organizing the Young Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're taking the boys on a weekend boat trip to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator of our lives."
2188,6,8,Stan Marsh,That sounds pretty fun.
2189,6,8,Randy Marsh,"[pondering] A Catholic boat trip? [raises his left eyebrow and begins to daydream. He first sees a ship and disco music starts to play. What he imagines is ""The Catholic Boat,"" a television program about cruises on a luxury cruise ship.]"
2190,6,8,Singer,"The Catholic Boat's gonna be headin' on out today.
The Catholic Boat. Time to throw all of your cares away.
Get some hot Christian action; it'll make you-"
2191,6,8,Randy Marsh,"[snapping out of it] Waaah! Waaah! [stops. Everyone in church looks at him, including Priest Maxi] Uyah [coughs a few times and clears his throat] ahem. 'Scuse me."
2192,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests."
2193,6,8,Richard Tweak,"We can let them go, can we?"
2194,6,8,Linda Stotch,There's no way my son's going.
2195,6,8,Stan Marsh,What are they talking about?
2196,6,8,Eric Cartman,I don't know.
2197,6,8,Tweek Tweak,Maybe they wanna kill us.
2198,6,8,Randy Marsh,"With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests."
2199,6,8,Stuart McCormick,"[dressed in fur-lined denim] Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters."
2200,6,8,Richard Tweak,"Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up."
2201,6,8,Sharon Marsh,I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
2202,6,8,Randy Marsh,It couldn't hurt.
2203,6,8,Richard Tweak,"Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes. [all fall silent, then start whistling as Father Maxi passes by.]"
2204,6,8,Priest Maxi,"[stops to listen] Uh... Good-bye, everyone."
2205,6,8,All,"[not all at once] Good-bye, Father. [resume whistling as Father Maxi walks off]"
2206,6,8,Stephen Stotch,"Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth."
2207,6,8,Counselor Gorache,"Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay?"
2208,6,8,Boys,Okay.
2209,6,8,Counselor Gorache,Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean?
2210,6,8,Boys,[separately] Nice.
2211,6,8,Stan Marsh,"Um, cool."
2212,6,8,Counselor Gorache,"Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your priest? [long pause]"
2213,6,8,Butters Stotch,Compassionate.
2214,6,8,Counselor Gorache,"Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt? [long pause]"
2215,6,8,Eric Cartman,Ih... in our... butt?
2216,6,8,Counselor Gorache,"You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just, did he ever try to put anything in your butt?"
2217,6,8,Stan Marsh,...Like ...money? What?
2218,6,8,Butters Stotch,"You mean, like a goldfish?"
2219,6,8,Counselor Gorache,"No, no. Did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt?"
2220,6,8,Boys,[in unison] No.
2221,6,8,Thomas Tucker,"This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids."
2222,6,8,Man,"Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?"
2223,6,8,Randy Marsh,"[rising. The others on his bench rise with him] You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!"
2224,6,8,Richard Tweak,That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.
2225,6,8,Linda Stotch,Let's all be atheists!
2226,6,8,All,"Yeah, yeah, alright."
2227,6,8,Man,"If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?"
2228,6,8,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!"
2229,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists."
2230,6,8,Stephen Stotch,"[thinks a bit, then looks at Randy] ...Same thing."
2231,6,8,Randy Marsh,Yeah! [all clamor and charge out of the center]
2232,6,8,Stan Marsh,What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? [silence. Only birds are heard]
2233,6,8,Eric Cartman,[thinking] Maybe... No.
2234,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,[stopping by] Hey dudes.
2235,6,8,Stan Marsh,Hey.
2236,6,8,Eric Cartman,Hey.
2237,6,8,Tweek Tweak,Arr!
2238,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,What are you guys doin'?
2239,6,8,Stan Marsh,"We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest every put anything in our butts."
2240,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,In your butts?
2241,6,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?"
2242,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,Why would he put anything in your butts?
2243,6,8,Stan Marsh,We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
2244,6,8,Eric Cartman,Hm.
2245,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,[joins them on the curb] Hm. [long pause]
2246,6,8,Chef,"[stopping by] Hello there, children!"
2247,6,8,Stan Marsh,Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
2248,6,8,Chef,Good-bah! [leaves quickly]
2249,6,8,Tweek Tweak,Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
2250,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation."
2251,6,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw, dude, I think I might have it."
2252,6,8,Stan Marsh,What?
2253,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[gets up and starts pacing] It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?"
2254,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
2255,6,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth. [long pause] Hm?"
2256,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!"
2257,6,8,Eric Cartman,"What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius."
2258,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,It wouldn't work!
2259,6,8,Eric Cartman,Have you ever tried it?
2260,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
2261,6,8,Eric Cartman,I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
2262,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You're on, fat boy!"
2263,6,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's go, Jew! [Cartman rushes off and Kyle follow. Stan and Tweek remain seated on the curb.]"
2264,6,8,Parents,"[pass by in a crowd screaming] Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!"
2265,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you're an atheist now!"
2266,6,8,Richard Tweak,"You too, Tweek!"
2267,6,8,Parents,"[moving on] Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!"
2268,6,8,Tweek Tweak,I'm a what??
2269,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming."
2270,6,8,Priest 1,"[African-American] No, thank you for finally organizing an all-priests meeting, Father Maxi. I think we all agree something has to be done, quickly. [the other priests concur]"
2271,6,8,Elderly Priest,"Well, I don't know how it's been for all of you, but attendance at my church in Fort Rawlins is down sixty-three percent! [pounds on the table for emphasis]"
2272,6,8,Priest 2,I'm down almost seventy in Greenleaf.
2273,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion."
2274,6,8,Elderly Priest,"Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public!"
2275,6,8,Fat Priest,They've gotta know to keep their mouths shut!
2276,6,8,Other priests,"That right, yeah."
2277,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What?"
2278,6,8,Priest 1,"Yes, but we've got to find out why these children are suddenly finding it necessary to report that they're being molested. Stop the problem at its source."
2279,6,8,Priest 2,"Yes, but how?"
2280,6,8,Priest 3,[amid discussion] Something has to be done.
2281,6,8,Priest 4,We've got to stop this-
2282,6,8,Priest Maxi,"[rising] Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem is that children are being molested, not that they're reporting it! [all fall silent]"
2283,6,8,Elderly Priest,How do you mean?
2284,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right?"
2285,6,8,Priest 1,Well did any of the children you've molested come forward?
2286,6,8,Priest Maxi,No.
2287,6,8,Priest 1,"Well, that's good."
2288,6,8,Priest Maxi,"No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church!"
2289,6,8,Elderly Priest,"Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed."
2290,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Oh for the love of God! Are you all saying that you've engaged in inappropriate relations with your altar boys? We are here to bring the light of God, not harm the innocent! [the other priests look at him and laugh] I'm serious!"
2291,6,8,Priest 2,"Father, uh, having sex with boys is part of the Catholic priest's way of life."
2292,6,8,Other priests,"Yeah. [they continue to talk, but Father Maxi isn't listening...]"
2293,6,8,Priest Maxi,Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help.
2294,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Cartman?"
2295,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns to look at Kyle] Hold on! [turns back to the task at hand] God, let a man crap!"
2296,6,8,Craig Tucker,[entering] What's going on?
2297,6,8,Stan Marsh,Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
2298,6,8,Craig Tucker,Oh. [leaves]
2299,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, go on, smartass, and do it!"
2300,6,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!"
2301,6,8,Stan Marsh,"You've had five, dude!"
2302,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[looking at the boys] I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around."
2303,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
2304,6,8,Eric Cartman,"Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?! [the other boys fix their gaze at him] Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. [tries again. A few spasms later and a big log of crap comes out his mouth and into the toilet. All the boys are stunned, even Cartman.]"
2305,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,Get the fuck out of here!
2306,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[excited] Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth! [starts chanting] I crapped out my mo-outh! [walks over to Kyle] You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!"
2307,6,8,Priest Maxi,"[to the driver] Well, there you go. Um, grazie. [the driver leaves, Father Maxi turns to walk to the Vatican] Wow, I'm actually here. Vatican City! [looks at the fountains on either side of the square. Inside the Vatican a choir sings softly in the background as Father Maxi awaits the pope. The room is full or prelates. The pope, hunched over and frail, approaches the altar with a group of bishops]"
2308,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from America. He has brought this all to our attention."
2309,6,8,Father Maxi,"[kneels before the pope] Your Holiness. [kisses the ring and the pope moans a bit in pain. The cardinal helps the pope up to his chair, then turns and approaches the pulpit.]"
2310,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Adoramus te, Christe."
2311,6,8,Other Cardinals,Et dominus...
2312,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Church. If things continue this way, we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again! [the prelates react immediately, protesting the report]"
2313,6,8,Father Maxi,That's right-wait. What?
2314,6,8,French Cardinal,In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys.
2315,6,8,Moroccan Cardinal,In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us.
2316,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught."
2317,6,8,Father Maxi,"Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what we should do is not have sex with boys! [the prelates protest again]"
2318,6,8,Italian Cardinal,It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong..
2319,6,8,Father Maxi,"Well, maybe we need to change the Holy Document of Vatican Law. [the prelates protest even louder]"
2320,6,8,British Cardinal,"Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed!"
2321,6,8,The Clergy,[more protests] Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah!
2322,6,8,Gelgamek Cardinal,"Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem.  [the prelates protest even louder]"
2323,6,8,Priest Maxi,Gelgameks?
2324,6,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. [puts his hands behind his back oh so modestly]"
2325,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,What? [appears genuinely concerned]
2326,6,8,Eric Cartman,"It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars! [Kyle gets upset] I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- [Kyle shuts the door on him, looks, then turns around and walks away from the door. Cartman pops up outside a window waving the bill at him. Kyle turns, goes to the window, and lowers the blinds, then walks off]"
2327,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food."
2328,6,8,Sharon Marsh,"That's right, everyone just dig in. [Grandpa takes a bite from his burger] So, kids,anything happen with your whole Sunday off?"
2329,6,8,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth."
2330,6,8,Sharon Marsh,Stanley! [Shelly isn't too pleased to hear that]
2331,6,8,Stan Marsh,What? He did.
2332,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Noho, it doesn't work that way, son."
2333,6,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah it does.
2334,6,8,Randy Marsh,No it doesn't.
2335,6,8,Stan Marsh,"[firmly] Yeah. It does. [Randy looks at him angrily, then wonders if it could be...]"
2336,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Honey! Honey, come quick!"
2337,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism!"
2338,6,8,French Cardinal,"What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi."
2339,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Well, for one, no sex with boys. [the prelates protest even louder]"
2340,6,8,Another Cardinal,"The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex?"
2341,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Uh well then, perhaps we could change the Holy Document of Vatican Law to say that... it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex... with women. [the prelates protest even louder]"
2342,6,8,French Cardinal,Women?
2343,6,8,Gelgamek Cardinal,The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?!
2344,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus-"
2345,6,8,Gelgamek Cardinal,What's that about the Gelgameks?! [the other Gelgamek clergy protest loudly]
2346,6,8,Priest Maxi,"I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here."
2347,6,8,Italian Cardinal,But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed!
2348,6,8,Priest Maxi,Why not?!
2349,6,8,Another Cardinal,Because we don't know where it is.
2350,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed."
2351,6,8,Priest Maxi,But if we locate it we can make changes to it?
2352,6,8,A bishop,"HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattlesnakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths!"
2353,6,8,Priest Maxi,Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!
2354,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[arriving] You guys! You guys! Look! [he's dressed in a bathrobe, swim trunks, and sandals]"
2355,6,8,Tweek Tweak,Harrr!
2356,6,8,Eric Cartman,I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
2357,6,8,Stan Marsh,So?
2358,6,8,Eric Cartman,"So? So now I can do this! [takes off his robe, throws the bills in the air, and rolls around in the floating bills.] Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!"
2359,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[simmers quietly, then] Go fuck yourself, Cartman!"
2360,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[luxuriating in the bills] Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm."
2361,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[gets off the couch and confronts Cartman] Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!"
2362,6,8,Eric Cartman,"Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go."
2363,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! [a news bulletin's music is heard]
2364,6,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, look."
2365,6,8,News Anchor,"[the News 4 set is shown] Our top story tonight, the age-old question has been answered: if I put food up my ass, will I crap out my mouth? All over the country, people are discovering that, yes, in fact, you will. [a new picture pops up] The surgeon-general had this to say:"
2366,6,8,Surgeon General,"And the uh immediate research shows that the act is not only amusing, but in fact much healthier for out bodies than the old way of eating. [stands next to a cut-away graphic of the human torso] You see, food entering through the anus has the benefit of being broken down on its way to the stomach rather than afterward. And therefore I believe that interorectogestion would actually put a stop to high cholesterol and most kinds of stomach cancers. And I base that on absolutely nothing."
2367,6,8,News Anchor,The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly.
2368,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[with a solid retort] That's stupid and immature, Cartman!"
2369,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[moves closer to Cartman] It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!"
2370,6,8,News Anchor,"The Mayor of South Park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating, young citizen [Cartman's picture appears]  Eric Cartman will be given... a freaking medal."
2371,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
2372,6,8,Announcer,"[a show logo appears...] Now, with more on ""Martha Stewart's Living"" [the logo disappears and the camera zooms in]."
2373,6,8,Martha Stewart,"In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can be inserted into the ass is essential. [begins to move to her left] Now, everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings, soups, raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods. What we're gonna do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for interorecto. [reaches the turkey and stops] Now, the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string, keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side. [starts wrapping the turkey. Two FBI agents show up at the rear of the set]"
2374,6,8,FBI agent,"Ms. Stewart, we have some questions."
2375,6,8,Martha Stewart,"[starts wrapping faster] Not right now, I just wanna focus on my turkey, [softly] right now. [the agents withdraw. She finishes and lays the turkey down on a platter] Now, we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - this'll help smooth the insertion later on. We still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound. [leaves that turkey alone and moves further left to a turkey fresh from the oven] When it's done we'll get something like this. [grins] So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. Let's try it out. [takes the cooked turkey, moves to a clear area onstage, sets the platter down, stands the turkey up, moves into position, and sits on the turkey. Slowly, with grunts every few seconds, she eats the turkey with her butt] Aaaaa-... Yeah, get it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh. [one final heavy grunt, and a sigh of relief, then she stands up] Phew. And that is how you eat a turkey. [grins] We'll be right back with more. [grins, and exit music plays]"
2376,6,8,Old Monk,[appears out of nowhere] Beoo!
2377,6,8,Priest Maxi,"[jumps back] Ahh, hello. Uh- My name is Father Maxi, from the United States."
2378,6,8,Old Monk,"What do you seek, Father?"
2379,6,8,Priest Maxi,I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it.
2380,6,8,Old Monk,That Gospel... [turns around and faces the door] lies somewhere beyond this door. [turns around] But... many troubles await thee inside! Only he whose heart truly belongs to the Lord shalla make it through.
2381,6,8,Priest Maxi,"I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, and... and that scroll may be our only hope!"
2382,6,8,Old Monk,"Then, prepare yourself. The time of trials begins. [turns and says to the door] Adoramus te, Christe! [the door becomes two doors, and they part to show the brilliant room. The old monk approaches Father Maxi] I wish you luck, Father. [moves to Father's left side and coaches him]Use all the strength, agility, and faith that you have."
2383,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Very well. Here we go. [enters and finds himself in a video game environment. He jumps over a hole in one screen, jumps on the heads of three alligators gingerly in the next screen, grabs at a rope and swings over a lake to the other side in the third screen. He reaches the fourth screen. A snake appears in the underground passageway beneath him] Hmmm, there's a ladder up here. [climbs down the ladder and sees the snake] Oh my God, a rattlesnake! [turns and runs past the ladder to the next screen, where another ladder awaits] A way back up! [climbs up and rushes out of there. He enters a secret chapel, having survived all the obstacles to get there. He's quite beaten up. The document sits on a lectern and is well-lit. Father Maxi sighs] I've made it! Praise be to God! He hath shown me the way! [approaches the document] This must be it. The Holy Document of Vatican Law. [picks it up and blows any dust from it.]"
2384,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. [all laugh]"
2385,6,8,Linda Stotch,"Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?"
2386,6,8,Richard Tweak,Atheism has definitely made our lives better.
2387,6,8,Sharon Marsh,"[arrives with fresh food and a basket] I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some."
2388,6,8,All,Ooohh.
2389,6,8,Sharon Marsh,"And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. [sets it down next to the coffee table]"
2390,6,8,Richard Tweak,"Oh thanks, Sharon."
2391,6,8,Man,"You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean- [the quesadillas appear, and he takes one] whoa, thank you -I mean, [rises and unzips his pants] it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society. [puts the quesadilla up to his butt and begins eating it. This causes him to grunt at times. Martha looks away] I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs. [finishes eating and zips up]"
2392,6,8,Richard Tweak,"That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying ""under God"" every day at school. That could really damage him. ""Under God"" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me. [turns aside, looks down, and opens his mouth] Moowwaaagh. [faces the group again and brushes off any remaining crap with his sweater sleeve] ""Under God"" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance."
2393,6,8,Randy Marsh,"[amid the chatter] That's right, I agree. [the others quiet down] And it should be taken off of money as well. [gets angry] The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel- [reaches for the basket and craps into it] Bwwaaaagh [finishes and sets the basket down] And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids."
2394,6,8,All,"That's right, that's right."
2395,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Cardinals, bishops and priests! Father Maxi has returned! And he has the Holy Document of-a Vatican Law! [the clergy ooohs and aaahs]"
2396,6,8,British Cardinal,How did he make it past the water lizards?
2397,6,8,Priest Maxi,"[lifts the parchment over his head for all to see] Yes, I have returned with the Holy Document of Vatican Law, so can we PLEASE, change  it now to say, ""It's NOT okay to have sex with boys""? [a shot of the clergy as the tapping of a staff is heard. It's the pope striking the ground with it.]"
2398,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Wait wait-a, the pope-a wants-a to say something. [the cardinal approaches the pope and has words with him, then returns to the pulpit] The pope-a says we shall ask the highest source. [the clergy ooohs and aaahs. They begin to sway and chant, and the windows above brighten as beams of light flood in]"
2399,6,8,Priest Maxi,[taken aback] Oh my. [a large screen-size area appears and a large creature rises from the depths]
2400,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"The holy one! [arachnid legs appear] Behold the great Queen Spider! [sure enough, a spider some twenty feet tall appears]"
2401,6,8,The Clergy,Hail Queen Spider!
2402,6,8,Priest Maxi,[looking at the Italian cardinal] Queen spider?
2403,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your guidance."
2404,6,8,Queen Spider,What do you ask of me?
2405,6,8,British Cardinal,"Great Queen Spider, we seek to change one of the Vatican rules."
2406,6,8,Queen Spider,The Vatican rules cannot be changed. So saith the Spider
2407,6,8,Italian Cardinal,"Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince her."
2408,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!! You people have completely lost touch with the outside world! You sit in this big room with your Gelgameks and your Queen Spider, and none of it applies to what being a Catholic is all about!!"
2409,6,8,A bishop,But the Holy Document of Vatican Law states that-
2410,6,8,Priest Maxi,"To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican Law!! [tears it in two, and the clergy gasps. The basilica begins to tremble and fall apart and the clergy start screaming in fear. Outside, the square itself begins to crumble]"
2411,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up] You guys, you guys! [drags a small inflatable wading pool behind him] I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!"
2412,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,[irritated] So?
2413,6,8,Eric Cartman,"So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long! [picks up the bag of quarters and prepares to pour them in] Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. [the quarters start pouring in, and Cartman gloats]"
2414,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Cartman and tries a different tack] Cartman, there's something I need to tell you."
2415,6,8,Eric Cartman,"O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?"
2416,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You were totally, one hundred percent right."
2417,6,8,Eric Cartman,Heh... [the smile vanishes] what?
2418,6,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend."
2419,6,8,Eric Cartman,"[taking time to figure out what that means...] You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! [kicks the pool and it deflates. He walks away angry. Stan and Kyle grin at each other - they planned this change in tactics. The parents arrive cheering and hollering]"
2420,6,8,A man,"Yeah, the pope is gone!"
2421,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!"
2422,6,8,Linda Stotch,Score one for us atheists
2423,6,8,Richard Tweak,"Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV! [the parents resume clamoring and move off]"
2424,6,8,Italian Cardinal,Gone! It's all gone!
2425,6,8,British Cardinal,"Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've killed our religion."
2426,6,8,Priest Maxi,"No I didn't! All that's dead are your stupid laws and rules! [the scene is being telecast] You've forgotten what being a Catholic is all about. [raises a Bible] This... book. You see, these are just stories. [the Marshes are gathered on the sofa to watch this. Grandpa is asleep in his wheelchair] Stories that are meant to help people in the right direction. Love your neighbor. Be a good person. [the Williams are watching] That's it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this. [shows off the ruins, and then the Queen Spider, then the Gelgameks] People are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them! They've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths! [The Tweeks are watching. Richard seems to have crapped out of his mouth]"
2427,6,8,Richard Tweak,"[pause, then looks up] ...What was that last bit?"
2428,6,8,Priest Maxi,"Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic. But I'm a Catholic in the real world. In today's world! It's time for you all to do that, too. It is time... for change."
2429,6,8,Randy Marsh,"[after a moment of reflection] He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up."
2430,6,8,Sharon Marsh,"O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore."
2431,6,8,Randy Marsh,"Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology."
2432,6,8,Stan Marsh,Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
2433,6,8,Randy Marsh,"No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. [all of a sudden, one more piece of crap comes out his mouth]"
2434,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, cool. A preview. [the curtain goes up and the preview, for a PG-rated film, airs]"
2435,6,9,Announcer,"Coming this summer [those words seem to approach the viewer], it's the classic film that changed America. E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, the new, redone version for 2002. [First, the classic shot of the kids flying across the sky with the moon in the background, then a shot of the kids taking off from the road. The police who are there to stop the kids have walkie-talkies in hand instead of guns.] All the E.T. effects have been digitally upgraded. [a shot of E.T. dressed in drag walking across a room] All the guns have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies. And the word ""TERRORIST"" has been changed to ""HIPPIE."""
2436,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Aw, dude, why would they do that?"
2437,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing."
2438,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C."
2439,6,9,Stan Marsh,That's gay. [next trailer airs. No rating seen]
2440,6,9,Announcer,"Coming this summer, it's the motion picture that changed America. Saving Private Ryan, the RE-RE-RELEASE, where the word ""NAZI"" has been changed to ""PERSONS WITH POLITICAL DIFFERENCES,"" and all their guns have been replaced by walkie-talkies. [a shot of the landing at Normandy, in all its bloody glory, but all the guns are indeed walkie-talkies]"
2441,6,9,Stan Marsh,Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
2442,6,9,Announcer,"And now, for your feature presentation: the classic RE-RE-RE-RELEASE of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"
2443,6,9,The Boys,Woohoo!
2444,6,9,Announcer,"In the version, the word ""WOOKIE"" has been changed to ""HAIR CHALLENGED ANIMAL"" and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by Ewoks."
2445,6,9,The Boys,"[first express shock, then anger] AWWWW!!! [they leave their seats.]"
2446,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit, that pissed me off!"
2447,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[they reach the ticket booth] Yeah, we want our money back!"
2448,6,9,Shlomo,"Sorry, suckers! [quickly rolls the blinds down. The boys turn around]"
2449,6,9,Eric Cartman,You asshole! [turns around and catches up with the other boys]
2450,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
2451,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore."
2452,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!"
2453,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now."
2454,6,9,Stan Marsh,We have to do something. Let's form a club.
2455,6,9,Eric Cartman,Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
2456,6,9,Stan Marsh,"No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!"
2457,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club"
2458,6,9,Eric Cartman,Yeah
2459,6,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah
2460,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!"
2461,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!"
2462,6,9,Tweek Tweak,I'm not! I'm not a team player!
2463,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!"
2464,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[giving in] D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!
2465,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!"
2466,6,9,Stan Marsh,Well what's wrong with it?
2467,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. [takes the marker and adds the words ""FRee HAT"" at the very end.]"
2468,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"""Free hat?"""
2469,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up."
2470,6,9,Tweek Tweak,But we don't have hats!
2471,6,9,Eric Cartman,Well we can just make them out of paper.
2472,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Aahh!
2473,6,9,Eric Cartman,"It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!"
2474,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??"
2475,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. [walks off with Cartman and Kyle screen right]"
2476,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Fifty hats? Oh Jesus! [runs off screen left]
2477,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! [his father happens by and notices the commotion]
2478,6,9,Richard Tweek,[approaching with his own mug] Tweek!
2479,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[shrieks] Hrrr!
2480,6,9,Richard Tweek,"Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center."
2481,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"My center. My... center. [closes his eyes and cups his chest] Calm [enters a state of meditation. Richard turns and leaves, his cup stays] Cup? [he finds himself sitting in the Lotus position by the side of a serene stream in a lovely meadow. All kinds of animals frolic around him, and a small Buddhist temple sits in the background]"
2482,6,9,Eric Cartman,[enormous face appearing over the clouds] Tweek! [brushes the clouds away with his hands] TWEEK!! [Tweek opens his eyes] TWEEK!!
2483,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[comes out of his meditation] Gaaaaah!
2484,6,9,Eric Cartman,How many hats have you made?
2485,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh God!
2486,6,9,Eric Cartman,We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow! [slaps him hard across the back.] Get the lead out!
2487,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Aaaah! Oh God! [Cartman turns and walks out, a rattled Tweek resumes making the hats.]"
2488,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"You guys, we have a big problem!"
2489,6,9,Stan Marsh,What?
2490,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!"
2491,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough."
2492,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet. [turns and opens the door, then peeks in. The place is packed. All the bleachers are filled, and there are five rows of people standing on the gym floor. He backs out, closes the door, and turns to his friends] Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!"
2493,6,9,Tweek Tweak,A thousand? [freaks out] Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
2494,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!"
2495,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Goohoo!
2496,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps forward] Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats."
2497,6,9,Crowd,"[from inside the gym] Free hat! [Kyle turns right, then left, not believing what he's hearing. Tweek's jaw drops] Free hat! Free hat!"
2498,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[""Free hat!""] Oh God!"
2499,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[""Free hat! Free hat! Free hat! Free hat!""] I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat."
2500,6,9,Crowd,Free hat! Free hat!
2501,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"I gotta move away, you guys!"
2502,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats."
2503,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[takes the mic] Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause."
2504,6,9,Crowd,Yeah! Yeah!
2505,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. [the cheering dies down and a voice pipes up]"
2506,6,9,Skeeter,Eh- Excuse me?
2507,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes the mic] Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them."
2508,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
2509,6,9,Woman,[a blonde] We don't care about that.
2510,6,9,Tweek Tweak,You don't?
2511,6,9,Stan Marsh,"You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?"
2512,6,9,Skeeter,Yeah. Free Hat.
2513,6,9,Tweek Tweak,What?
2514,6,9,Man,"Hat McCollough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!"
2515,6,9,Man 2,Yeah!
2516,6,9,Crowd,Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
2517,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Aaaah, [""Free Ha-""], okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? [the crowd stops moving]"
2518,6,9,Man,To do what?
2519,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
2520,6,9,Skeeter,"Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. [the crowd breaks up and exits]"
2521,6,9,Crowd,Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
2522,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Waitwaitwaitwait! [the crowd stops] Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!"
2523,6,9,Skeeter,Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?
2524,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat."
2525,6,9,Some people,Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!
2526,6,9,Crowd,Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
2527,6,9,Stan Marsh,"...212, 213, 214 members!"
2528,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[barges in through the front door] You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!"
2529,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2530,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
2531,6,9,Stan Marsh,Really? That's great.
2532,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yah.
2533,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!"
2534,6,9,Stan Marsh,"If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films."
2535,6,9,Eric Cartman,But just remember that I do all the talking.
2536,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,You?? Why?
2537,6,9,Eric Cartman,Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
2538,6,9,Stan Marsh,When did we do dibs for it?
2539,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Just now - [quickly, counting off with his left hand] 1 2 3 dibs! [punches his right palm with his left fist]"
2540,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Me.
2541,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Ga-ahah!
2542,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, fine! [points to Cartman] You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!"
2543,6,9,Eric Cartman,What could possibly go wrong?
2544,6,9,Ted Koppel,"A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?"
2545,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[blinks and looks at the camera for a long time] ...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. [the camera moves from Cartman to Tweek]"
2546,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Gaaarh!
2547,6,9,Ted Koppel,"Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?"
2548,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[""TWEEK, ADVOCATE OF TODDLER MURDER"" appears at the bottom of the screen] Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!"
2549,6,9,Ted Koppel,"Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as ""positive"" about toddler murder?"
2550,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?
2551,6,9,Ted Koppel,"[ponders the possibility] Yes... It is easy. [switches gears] Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?"
2552,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
2553,6,9,Ted Koppel,"Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [they walk in and stand behind the boys. The boys look at them a bit awed]"
2554,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!
2555,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"[wearing a CSLB jacket and director's hat] Hello, Ted."
2556,6,9,George Lucas,"[meekly] Oh hi, Ted."
2557,6,9,Ted Koppel,"Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?"
2558,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers."
2559,6,9,George Lucas,You're here.
2560,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[to Stan] Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [resumes gawking at the two]"
2561,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!"
2562,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children."
2563,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children."
2564,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we're children."
2565,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?"
2566,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted."
2567,6,9,Ted Koppel,How so?
2568,6,9,Eric Cartman,Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
2569,6,9,George Lucas,I'm not a Jew! [crosses his arms in anger]
2570,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ewver did."
2571,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!"
2572,6,9,Steven Spielberg,[a stroke of brilliance overcomes the two men for a few seconds] Wait a minute. What'd you say?
2573,6,9,George Lucas,"Eh, that's brilliant!"
2574,6,9,Steven Spielberg,Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!
2575,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,[regretting the comparison] No. NOO!!
2576,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark. [the crowd begins to murmur] There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? [hands the mic to Cartman, who moves over to an easel]"
2577,6,9,Eric Cartman,Thank you. [turns a page up and over. A schematic of George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch is shown] Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
2578,6,9,Man 3,And if we get a hold ot the negative they can't change the movie?
2579,6,9,Stan Marsh,That is our understanding.
2580,6,9,Woman,Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
2581,6,9,Crowd,YEAH!
2582,6,9,Skeeter,Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!
2583,6,9,Crowd,YEAH! [the signs go up] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
2584,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rusn to the mic] Nonono! We need to do this first.
2585,6,9,Woman,But we have to free Hat.
2586,6,9,Stan Marsh,"It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies."
2587,6,9,Man 4,"Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!"
2588,6,9,Crowd,YEAH!
2589,6,9,Eric Cartman,He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
2590,6,9,Skeeter,Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.
2591,6,9,Man 5,"Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!"
2592,6,9,Crowd,YEAH! [the signs go up] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
2593,6,9,Stan Marsh,Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
2594,6,9,Skeeter,"He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat."
2595,6,9,Crowd,YEAH! [the signs go up and the crowd moves out. Not one of them stays with the boys] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
2596,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves."
2597,6,9,Tweek Tweak,No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! [walks off the stage]
2598,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
2599,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Hwaaah!
2600,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up to stop Tweek] Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well."
2601,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Haaah!
2602,6,9,Eric Cartman,"People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?"
2603,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Okay, go. [the other boys, with their own flashlights, pour in]"
2604,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[trying to stay composed, with eyes closed] I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field."
2605,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[draws near] Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! [walks off]"
2606,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,[eyeing a prop] This looks like the right room.
2607,6,9,Tweek Tweak,I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.
2608,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[finding the video library] Over here! [the other boys join him at the stacks. They see ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 300,"" ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 301,"" ""Star Wars Episode 1, Version 302,"" etc., then ""First Day of School"" and ""First Day of School, Digitally Enhanced,"" then ""Wedding Video"" and ""Wedding Video, Digitally Enhanced."" The camera scans past ""Kids First Swimming Lesson"" and ""Kids First Swimming Lesson w/ Digitally Enhanced Weather"" to stop at the reel of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark, Original Negative 1982.""]"
2609,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,That's it!
2610,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!"
2611,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Huh uh.
2612,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!"
2613,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Guh huh huh! [walks off and returns with a stool. He climbs up on it and gets the reel canister. The door opens behind the boys and the lights go on]
2614,6,9,George Lucas,What are you doing?! [the boys turn in horror]
2615,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh God! Oh Jesus!
2616,6,9,George Lucas,You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that! [grabs the film reel from Tweek]
2617,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[hops off the stool] Aaaaaah!
2618,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas! [goes down on his right knee] But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark."
2619,6,9,George Lucas,"We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!"
2620,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B."
2621,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Aw, really?"
2622,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Oh God, no! Not Plan B! [Lucas looks at the boys quzzically]"
2623,6,9,Eric Cartman,"[beat] You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? [the boys reach for the left side of their bodies and rip off their clothes. Underneath they wear colorful Latin outfits and grin.]"
2624,6,9,George Lucas,[confused] ...What??
2625,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Hit it, Tweek! [Tweek goes over to a boombox and presses the play button, then returns to the group. Caribbean music plays] In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-"
2626,6,9,Stan Marsh,Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
2627,6,9,Eric Cartman,"...No, he has an icy heart."
2628,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart."
2629,6,9,Stan Marsh,"So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song"
2630,6,9,Eric Cartman,It's a cool island song.
2631,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
2632,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, do we wanna do that?"
2633,6,9,George Lucas,"ALRIGHT, that does it!"
2634,6,9,George Lucas,"[listening] Yes, thank you, officer. [hangs up and walks around the boys] The police are on their way, boys. [stops and faces them] Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED!"
2635,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[freaks out] Aaaahh!
2636,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. [Lucas looks at them]"
2637,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. [Lucas hangs his head in shame and turns away]"
2638,6,9,George Lucas,"It is... too late for me, boys."
2639,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
2640,6,9,George Lucas,"M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them"
2641,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[steps forward] You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours."
2642,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society"
2643,6,9,George Lucas,Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?
2644,6,9,Stan Marsh,Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
2645,6,9,George Lucas,"[turns and approaches them] Perhaps... you are right. [presents the reel to Stan, but a door opens...]"
2646,6,9,A Voice,"STOP! [Lucas is startled and the camera pans to Steven Spielberg and three guards] What are you doing, George?!"
2647,6,9,George Lucas,"Steven, Uh, I-"
2648,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!"
2649,6,9,George Lucas,"Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was good."
2650,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?! [voice lowers] Don't forget: you belong to me."
2651,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! [Lucas, stuck between the two arguments, stops and thinks...]"
2652,6,9,George Lucas,"I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys. [slowly walks to Spielberg and presents the reel. Spielberg snatches it away]"
2653,6,9,Steven Spielberg,[cackles] Now take the children prisoner! [the guards approach and surround the boys]
2654,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,What??
2655,6,9,Steven Spielberg,You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW Raiders of the Lost Ark! Your gay little club is over!
2656,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! [the boys turn and make their way to the door]"
2657,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[runs] Oh my God they're gonna kill us. [the guards block the way, and the other three boys are stuck. Kyle tries to get around a guard, but...]"
2658,6,9,Guard 1,"[aims his walkie-talkie at him] Don't even think about it, kid! I'm not afraid to use this walkie-talkie!"
2659,6,9,Guard 2,"The one with the cocaine-problem escaped, mein Direktor."
2660,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Leave him!! Let him run back to his mommy! [strokes the reel canister] We must get the film ready for the premiere. [turns and walks off] Lucas! Come! [Lucas, shame-faced, turns and follows Spielberg out. The boys look at the guards]"
2661,6,9,Announcer,"[""COMING THIS SUMMER""]Coming, this summer! [""RE-RELEASE OF EPISODE 1 SOUTHPARK""] It's the digitally-enhanced re-release of the very first pilot episode of South Park! [scens from ""Cartman Gets An Anal Probe"" play - the cafeteria, the boys walking down the street, Stan, Kyle, and Wendy in the woods, Stan and Kyle at Stark's Pond...] Yes, the classic, rough, hand-made first episode is getting a make-over for 2002! [the visitors are shown, then new 3D versions are shown] The simple, funny aliens are now super-badass and kewl! [the mothership is shown beaming Cartman up, then a much more intricate version is shown] Flying saucer? No longer cheap construction paper, but a 4.0 megapixel constructed through a masterpiece of technology! Everything's new! New is better!"
2662,6,9,Trey Parker,"[bearded] When we first made South Park, we didn't wanna use construction paper. We just had to because it was cheap."
2663,6,9,Matt Stone,"And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused."
2664,6,9,Trey Parker,Expensive. [Both men nod their heads]
2665,6,9,Announcer,"[The flames coming from Cartman's ass are replaced with a 3D version, and cars and people are added to the scene] Yes, all the charm of a simple little cartoon [a model of the new ship is rotated to a new position] will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation!"
2666,6,9,Trey Parker,"[a shot of him, then of the bus stop with the boys waiting for the bus. New creatures enter the scene] For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it."
2667,6,9,Announcer,"[A special-edition DVD of CGAAP ""new version for 2002"" is shown. ""ACT NOW"" blinks on the screen over the DVD]Get this special enhanced version quick, because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for 2003!"
2668,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president [Stan], treasurer [Kyle], and secretary [Cartman] have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!"
2669,6,9,Man 3,"Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?"
2670,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"[grits his teeth, shuts his eyes and bows his head in frustration] Yes, just like hat!!"
2671,6,9,Skeeter,But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison? [the other members grumble]
2672,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!"
2673,6,9,Woman,"Hey, he's got a point there."
2674,6,9,Man 6,[a rancher] Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song!
2675,6,9,Townspeople / Free Hat Club Members,[scattered reaction] Yeah.
2676,6,9,Tweek Tweak,No!
2677,6,9,Skeeter,No?
2678,6,9,Man 7,No! He's right. We have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song.
2679,6,9,Woman,Or is ti freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
2680,6,9,Man 8,Let's cool his hot temper with a fresh island song.
2681,6,9,Man 9,That's it!
2682,6,9,Man 1,Let's go! Come on! [the members rally and take off]
2683,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
2684,6,9,Pat O Brien,"Well, the print is finished and the day has come. Tonight, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas [shown] will be at the premiere of the new special edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lots of celebrity guests and other rich people will be on hand to witness all the updated effects and modernized technology."
2685,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Hello!
2686,6,9,Steven Spielberg,[moves forward and takes a hard look at the figure on the hill] The kid? The tweaked out kid?!
2687,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg! [the other boys try to sneak away, but the guards are around them quickly]"
2688,6,9,Steven Spielberg,Your pesistence surprises even me. [begins to fan himself with his hat]
2689,6,9,Francis Ford Coppola,[steps forward] Surely you don't think you can escape from this premiere.
2690,6,9,Tweek Tweak,[fixes his aim on his target] That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
2691,6,9,Eric Cartman,Wow.
2692,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
2693,6,9,Eric Cartman,AY!
2694,6,9,Francis Ford Coppola,And if we refuse?
2695,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Then your premiere has no movie!
2696,6,9,Stan Marsh,He's definitely lost it
2697,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yup.
2698,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"[moves around to clear the area] Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand ba- stand back! Back! [people move away] Okay kid, you win. [puts on his hat] Blow it up. [some guards try to get the box, but Spielberg takes a walkie-talkie and forces them back] Zuroch!  Zuroch! [turns and faces Tweek] Blow it back to God. [Tweek trembles, but his aim doesn't waver] All your life has been the pursuit of seeing a great film! This new version of Raiders has digital effects beyond your wildest dreams! You want to see it screened just as much as I. [Tweek grunts, showing he may be breaking]"
2699,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!"
2700,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"[turns, walks to the box, and stands next to it] Son, we are simply passing through history. This... is imPROVED history. [Tweek stalls. The boys wait for Tweek's next move] Do as you will. [backs away, leaving the box clear. Tweek struggles, but lowers the launcher. Three guards appear behind him]"
2701,6,9,Townspeople / Free Hat Club Members,"In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, the air is fresh and the people are free."
2702,6,9,Man 5,But here in the mountain there's no freedom like that.
2703,6,9,Skeeter,There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. [the governor looks up a bit surprised]
2704,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"[moving his arms over the Ark] Hafaa malifi! Thanks for coming, everyone. [the two men return, remove the lid, and walk off with it. A third man reaches inside the Ark and pulls out the ""RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK NEW AND IMPROVED 2002"" reel] This is the birth of the NEW version of Raiders of the Lost Ark! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration!"
2705,6,9,Premiere Audience Members,Hooray! All right!
2706,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"Begin the film! [a man loads the film and plays it. On screen, three men appear and approach a mountain]"
2707,6,9,Premiere Audience Members,[impressed] Whoa.
2708,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[pleading] You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it."
2709,6,9,Tweek Tweak,"Ah, what?!"
2710,6,9,Stan Marsh,"[pleading] Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! [the boys quickly turn away, shut their eyes, and bow their heads]"
2711,6,9,Premiere Audience Members,[impressed] Whoa. Ahhh.
2712,6,9,Steven Spielberg,"It's beyooootiful. [a scene of Indiana Jones using a whip to swing across a chasm. Flaming arrows shoot past him. As he lands on theother side, natives approach.They look and chatter like Ewoks]"
2713,6,9,Viewer 1,Wait a minute. This version is awful!
2714,6,9,Viewer 2,Yeah! They ruined it!
2715,6,9,Viewer 3,"Oh my God, it's terrible! [George Lucas is suddenly frightened stiff. Coppola is also frightened. The boys keep their eyes closed and away from the screen]"
2716,6,9,George Lucas,AaaaAAAAA!!
2717,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Yuh, you guys okay. [the others open their eyes. The ropes that bound them are gone]"
2718,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I I think so.
2719,6,9,Eric Cartman,"Man, that new version must have sucked balls."
2720,6,9,Mayor's Aide,"Today is a day of celebration, and we owe it all to these four brave young boys. [The four boys grin]"
2721,6,9,Townsman,Yeah! Alright!
2722,6,9,Mayor's Aide,"And thanks to the bravery of this young man in particular, [Tweek smiles proudly] ...Hat McCollough is finally free from prison! [the smiles fade from the boys' faces]"
2723,6,9,Townsfolk,Yeah! Woohoohoo!
2724,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,...What? [a thin balding man with creepy appearance walks onstage and waves to everyone]
2725,6,9,Townsfolk,Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat!
2726,6,9,Hat McCollough,"Thank you everyone-KILL! KILL THE INNOCENT!! Uh, I'm so thankful for all your support-RAPE THE VIRGINS!! And uh, I just wonder if i could get a baby real quick? [grins in a creepy way. The crowd falls silent for a moment]"
2727,6,9,Skeeter,Sure. Give that man a baby!
2728,6,9,Townsfolk,Yeah! Woohoohoo! [the aide comes onstage holding a baby in his arms. Hat looks at the baby sinisterly. The baby senses this and quickly crawls up the aide's arm and onto his shoulder]
2729,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys turn and walk off. Tweek can't help but look at the baby's fate]"
2730,6,9,Tweek Tweak,Oh my God!
2731,6,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan? [the boys stop] I mean, no one even seemed to notice."
2732,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world."
2733,6,9,Eric Cartman,That and youth. Those guys are old.
2734,6,9,Tweek Tweak,But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
2735,6,9,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it."
2736,6,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh, hello boys."
2737,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again."
2738,6,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh, but I thought your teacher died."
2739,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay."
2740,6,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. [turns and walks off]"
2741,6,10,Tweek Tweak,Cartman likes to play with dolls?
2742,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[strokes the lamb and sets it aside] Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious. [grabs a basket with a bottle of lotion sitting inside and lowers it down the hole. The basket stops when it reaches Polly Prissy Pants, which sits at the bottom of the hole] Now it takes the lotion from the basket."
2743,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"[Cartman voicing] Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here."
2744,6,10,Eric Cartman,It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
2745,6,10,Poodle,[Cartman voicing] Bark bark bark bark!
2746,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket."
2747,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"Please, mister, let me out."
2748,6,10,Eric Cartman,It puts the lotion back in the basket!
2749,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"I miss my mom, mister. I wanna see my Mommy-"
2750,6,10,Eric Cartman,[throws a fit] Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
2751,6,10,Liane Cartman,Sweetie.
2752,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes, mom?"
2753,6,10,Liane Cartman,You have to get ready for school.
2754,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[thinks a bit, then looks up] ...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?"
2755,6,10,Liane Cartman,"Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back."
2756,6,10,Eric Cartman,[pause] Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
2757,6,10,Liane Cartman,"You'll get over it, honey."
2758,6,10,Eric Cartman,[starts to throw another fit] But I wanna plaaayyy.
2759,6,10,Wendy,I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? [Bebe walks in]
2760,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Hey guys.
2761,6,10,Wendy,Hey Bebe.
2762,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"You guys, uh, [holds out her arms] notice anything different? [looks down at her body]"
2763,6,10,Wendy,"[the three girls gaze] Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs!"
2764,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away."
2765,6,10,Mr Mackey,"[enters the classroom and walks past the girls] M'kay, kids, let's take our seats, m'kay? [the girls take their seats] I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?"
2766,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?"
2767,6,10,Mr Mackey,"No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems. [turns, grabs some chalk, and starts writing on the board] M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do, uh, four time four, m'kay?"
2768,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look at Bebe. [""We'll move into the five times thing."" Bebe is busy taking notes. ""We'll try five time three...""] Something seems different about her."
2769,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?"
2770,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know. [Bebe continues writing]
2771,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"Hey Token. You know, I never really noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool."
2772,6,10,Token Black,"I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with."
2773,6,10,Butters Stotch,"[pipes up behind Annie] Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? [Bebe continues writing]"
2774,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?"
2775,6,10,Craig Tucker,I don't know. Why?
2776,6,10,Eric Cartman,It just... It just seems like a really awesome shirt.
2777,6,10,Craig Tucker,"Yeah. It kinda does. [Bebe continues writing, but stops and looks to her right. All the boys are looking at her, all the girls look at the board.]"
2778,6,10,Mr Mackey,"Okay, and so uh, [Bebe is looking back, wondering why the boys keep staring at her] so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?"
2779,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"[breaks the stare and answers] Oh, uh, forty-eight?"
2780,6,10,All the boys,Whoa.
2781,6,10,Clyde Donovan,That is an awesome answer!
2782,6,10,All the boys,Yeah!
2783,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Bebe is really smart!
2784,6,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
2785,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, may be."
2786,6,10,Wendy,"...And I was like, ""I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars."" [the girls stop and giggle]"
2787,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[arriving with a group of boys: Kyle, Cartman, Token, Butters, Tweek, and Clyde] Ah, hey, Bebe."
2788,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Yeah?
2789,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us."
2790,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Really? [Wendy and Red look at her] I've never done that before.
2791,6,10,Butters Stotch,"[Stan and Kyle part a bit for a better view] Wuuhh, it's really fun. You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me."
2792,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's cool."
2793,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Well sure, that sounds hella fun."
2794,6,10,The boys,Hahahahahaha...
2795,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
2796,6,10,Stan Marsh,Hella fun.
2797,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Right, heh."
2798,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"Wow, hella fun. That's awesome."
2799,6,10,Token Black,I'm gonna start saying that now.
2800,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Cool. [the boys turn as one and walk back the way they came] We'll see you later, Bebe."
2801,6,10,Wendy,"[Wendy catches up to Stan. The boys are grinning. Stan stops and looks] Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys."
2802,6,10,Stan Marsh,"That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. [turns and walks off]"
2803,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,[looks over his shoulder] Yeah. She's really cool. [Wendy gets upset]
2804,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"It's weird how we never noticed before. [Wendy looks back at Bebe, who just shrugs]"
2805,6,10,Stan Marsh,"So what you do, see, is you wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. [he throws a rock towards the road and the others look at the trajectory. A blue pick-up truck drives by and is hit]"
2806,6,10,Driver,You damn kids!
2807,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Cool.
2808,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"You try it, Bebe."
2809,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Okay.
2810,6,10,Token Black,Here comes a sedan. [Bebe throws a rock at the red sedan and hits it]
2811,6,10,Driver,You damn kids!
2812,6,10,The boys,Awesome!
2813,6,10,Butters Stotch,Cool! [close up] That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
2814,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"That was sweet, Bebe. [shows her another rock and another grip] Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-"
2815,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah. [grabs a hold of the rock and pulls it a bit] Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-"
2816,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,[pulls back] I'm showing her.
2817,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"[pulls back] Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-"
2818,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[gives an ape look and smacks Clyde, who lets go of the rock] Hoh!"
2819,6,10,Clyde Donovan,[grunts back and moves off] Hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe is stunned at this development]
2820,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh! [watches, then reverts to normal and talks to Bebe. Stan moves in] Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-"
2821,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[grabs the rock and demonstrates] Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-"
2822,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[peeved] Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe backs up, scared]"
2823,6,10,Stan Marsh,Hoh hoh hoh!
2824,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hah hah hah!
2825,6,10,Craig Tucker,[beats his chest] Urh urh urh! [all the boys start grunting and displaying aggression]
2826,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Uh. Listen guys, um, it's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. [leaves. The boys continue grunting and putting on displays. She walks faster the farther she moves from the boys. The boys notice her absence and stop.]"
2827,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[beat] ...Wait, what were we doing again?"
2828,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,We were throwing rocks at cars.
2829,6,10,The boys,Oh yeah.
2830,6,10,Eric Cartman,Woohoo.
2831,6,10,Butters Stotch,[points] Uh there comes an SUV. [Token throws a rock and hits the SUV]
2832,6,10,Jimbo Kern,You damn kids!
2833,6,10,The boys,"Hi, Bebe."
2834,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Hey everybody.
2835,6,10,Wendy,"[rolls her eyes and rests her head on her right hand] Oh, for Christ's sake!"
2836,6,10,Mr Mackey,"[arriving, puts his textbooks on the teacher's desk] M'kay. Kids, yesterday I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who wants to start? [Clyde raises his hand] M'kay, Clyde?"
2837,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"[picks up his paper and starts] My paper is called, ""Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever""."
2838,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, that's what I wrote about!"
2839,6,10,Butters Stotch,Me too!
2840,6,10,Clyde Donovan,[grunts] Hoh!
2841,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[grunts and pounds his desk] Hah hah, hah! [the other boys start grunting like apes]"
2842,6,10,Mr Mackey,"Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde."
2843,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"[glowers at Stan, then reads] ""My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end."" [some applause]"
2844,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper?"
2845,6,10,Token Black,"[picks up his paper and reads] ""If I could be Bebe."" [Wendy is miffed and rolls her eyes] ""If I was Bebe, I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."""
2846,6,10,Mr Mackey,"[takes a moment to think, then] M'kay, interesting, Token. Uh... Who would like to go next? [the rest of the boys raise their hands energetically and make small sounds to get Mackey's attention] Uh, how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is?"
2847,6,10,The boys,[softly] Oh. [they lower their hands. Bebe raises hers]
2848,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, Bebe?"
2849,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"[picks up her paper and reads] ""My cat Thumper."""
2850,6,10,The boys,Wwooww.
2851,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"[sees the reaction and continues reading] ""Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail."" [the boys break out in laughter]"
2852,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Chase his tail? That must be so funny!
2853,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"""Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."""
2854,6,10,The boys,Wwooww!
2855,6,10,Eric Cartman,"God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone."
2856,6,10,Craig Tucker,"That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet."
2857,6,10,Stan Marsh,That's such a great paper! [starts clapping. The other boys join in the applause]
2858,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?"
2859,6,10,Wendy,"[picks up her paper and reads] ""The new Cold War."""
2860,6,10,Eric Cartman,Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! [the boys crack up]
2861,6,10,Wendy,"But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-"
2862,6,10,Clyde Donovan,"[arrives with Kyle, Token, Craig, Bradley, and Francis] Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?"
2863,6,10,Wendy,[angrily] No!
2864,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe she's in the lunch line.
2865,6,10,The boys,Yeah.
2866,6,10,Wendy,Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
2867,6,10,Millie Larsen,I can't stand her anymore! She's such a slut!
2868,6,10,Esther,She's a total slut!
2869,6,10,Red,You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.
2870,6,10,Millie Larsen,I heard that she lifted her shirt to the boys at the bus stop.
2871,6,10,Wendy,"I heard that her asshole is this big around. [makes a hole with her hands, thumb touching thumb, the other fingers touching their counterparts on the other hand]"
2872,6,10,Millie and Esther,Wwooww.
2873,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[comes into view] Hey guys.
2874,6,10,Wendy,"Oh, hey Bebe. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut."
2875,6,10,Millie Larsen,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
2876,6,10,Esther,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
2877,6,10,Millie Larsen,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
2878,6,10,Bebe Stevens,...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
2879,6,10,Wendy,"Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut."
2880,6,10,Millie Larsen,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
2881,6,10,Esther,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
2882,6,10,Red,[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
2883,6,10,Wendy,Slut.
2884,6,10,Millie Larsen,"[fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [the girls take their trays and leave, giggling]"
2885,6,10,Girls,[out of view] Whore. Slut. Slut.
2886,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Bebe, is something the matter?"
2887,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"[turns and faces her mom] Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today. [faces the window again and rests her head on her right hand] They called me a ""slut with a huge gaping vagina""."
2888,6,10,Bebe s Mom,"[approaches] Oh, sweetie. You're all just growing up. [begins to stroke Bebe's hair] Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next."
2889,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool."
2890,6,10,Bebe s Mom,"I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family."
2891,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine! [rests her head on her hands] Guys are way cooler, anyways."
2892,6,10,Tweek Tweak,[arrives] You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
2893,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk."
2894,6,10,Tweek Tweak,[sits next to Cartman] Oh God.
2895,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[offers Tweek his plate] Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met."
2896,6,10,Stan Marsh,True.
2897,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,True.
2898,6,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2899,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yep.
2900,6,10,Eric Cartman,"And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process."
2901,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Right.
2902,6,10,Stan Marsh,Uh huh.
2903,6,10,Eric Cartman,"And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend."
2904,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
2905,6,10,Stan Marsh,That would be best.
2906,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you."
2907,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Huh??
2908,6,10,Stan Marsh,Kyle??
2909,6,10,Eric Cartman,"And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts]"
2910,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!"
2911,6,10,Eric Cartman,"And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip."
2912,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!"
2913,6,10,Eric Cartman,Pleeeeease???
2914,6,10,Stan Marsh,No!
2915,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[removes the watch and peanuts] Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that it's been really fun. Here's a watch and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts again]"
2916,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,No way! Tweek's cool!
2917,6,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
2918,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?"
2919,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
2920,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Sure thing, Bebe."
2921,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[arrives] That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan! [leaves, then returns] Fuck you, Tweek! [leaves, then returns] Bebe, you're still cool. [leaves again]"
2922,6,10,Wendy,What are you doing?!
2923,6,10,Clyde Donovan,We're trying to get Bebe to run for class president.
2924,6,10,Wendy,I'm class president! The vote was last fall!
2925,6,10,Craig Tucker,"Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you."
2926,6,10,Token Black,[gushing] Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.
2927,6,10,The Other Boys,Uh huh.
2928,6,10,Wendy,"She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! [the boys just look at her]"
2929,6,10,Clyde Donovan,What?
2930,6,10,Wendy,"Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! [walks away in a funk]"
2931,6,10,Butters Stotch,[puts his fists on his hips] Stupider than Bebe!
2932,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Yeah!
2933,6,10,Craig Tucker,Yeah!
2934,6,10,Butters Stotch,"Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?"
2935,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Yeah!
2936,6,10,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
2937,6,10,Craig Tucker,Sure is!
2938,6,10,Butters Stotch,Uhyep.
2939,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
2940,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. [they arrive, but find four other boys arriving at the same time: Timmy, Kevin, Bradley, and Francis] Where are you guys going?"
2941,6,10,Bradley Biggle,We're going to see our friend Bebe.
2942,6,10,Stan Marsh,Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
2943,6,10,Francis,Bebe is everybody's friend.
2944,6,10,Kevin Stoley,Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives.
2945,6,10,Stan Marsh,[steps forward and grunts] Hoh!
2946,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,[steps forward and grunts] Hoh hoh hoh!
2947,6,10,Kevin Stoley,Arf arf!
2948,6,10,Francis,Arf! [a few more grunts are heard]
2949,6,10,Timmy Burch,Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!
2950,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. [goes and knocks on the door]"
2951,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Oh, hello, boys."
2952,6,10,Stan Marsh,Is Bebe home?
2953,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait."
2954,6,10,Bradley Biggle,Who is she with?
2955,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"I believe she is playing ""Lambs"" over at Eric Cartman's house."
2956,6,10,Stan Marsh,Cartman's?
2957,6,10,Eric Cartman,[holds up the poodle] And this is Precious.
2958,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Precious?
2959,6,10,Eric Cartman,"[squeezes the poodle] Bark bark bark. [sets the poodle aside] Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket [puts the lotion in the basket] and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. [the basket descends]"
2960,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[watches the basket drop] Uh huh. [the basket stops once again in front of Polly Prissy Pants]
2961,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."""
2962,6,10,Bebe Stevens,It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
2963,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Heheh, yeah."
2964,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"Mister, please let me out of here."
2965,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Now say it again, louder."
2966,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[louder] It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
2967,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!"
2968,6,10,Polly Prissy Pants,"My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!"
2969,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"""
2970,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Put the lotion in the basket!
2971,6,10,Eric Cartman,"Put the lotion in the fucking basket! [pushes the rubber poodle into the hole] Oh no! Precious! [does Polly's voice] I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it! [a door is heard opening and Kyle goes down the steps, followed by Stan, Kevin, Craig, Clyde, Butters, Francis, Tweek, Bradley, Token, Pip, and Timmy] Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"""
2972,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Don't you hurt my fucking dog!
2973,6,10,Eric Cartman,"You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- [stops when he hears Timmy's wheelchair and looks around]"
2974,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing?
2975,6,10,Eric Cartman,"We're playing ""Lambs."""
2976,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[moves over to Bebe] Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today."
2977,6,10,Butters Stotch,[moves forward] Then we gotta work on your campaign.
2978,6,10,Francis,"[moves forward] Right, but first we gotta go to the-"
2979,6,10,Stan Marsh,[jumps in front of Boy 2] Hoh! [the other boys begin to grunt and face each other]
2980,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"You guys, calm down!"
2981,6,10,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
2982,6,10,Bebe Stevens,This is insane!
2983,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Stop it you guys, please!"
2984,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble!"
2985,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[atop a pile of boys] Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! [he's knocked them all out and tossed them into a mound]"
2986,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out."
2987,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"I know. They've been there all day. [Outside, Token messes with a trash can. Cartman notices and walks over, pushing the trash can down. Stan plays with a rock on the steps. Craig inches his way towards Stan, who watches him from time to time, and Francis is up a tree.]"
2988,6,10,Stan Marsh,"Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!"
2989,6,10,Craig Tucker,"Hah hah hahah hah! [the other boys turn and start grunting. Stan chases Craig away from the steps, then returns to sitting there.]"
2990,6,10,Stan Marsh,Hoh hoh hoh! [picks up his rock and plays with it] Hohohoh hoh!
2991,6,10,Mrs Stevens,Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.
2992,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?"
2993,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman."
2994,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters."
2995,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart. [gives her a hug and then leaves]"
2996,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Mom? [her mom stops and turns around] What's six times eight?
2997,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers. [satisfied, she turns around and walks out and downstairs. She opens the front door and the boys back away grunting] Alright boys, time to be getting home. Bebe's not feeling well and she can't come out today. Go one, shoo. [the boys walk away slowly, grunting in disappointment. A whistling sound is heard and a space shuttle crashes into a field across the street. The boys stop at the sight.]"
2998,6,10,Stan Marsh,Hoh. Hoh?
2999,6,10,Astronaut 1,Aah. We made it.
3000,6,10,Astronaut 2,"Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us? [the boys start to grunt again. Stan backs up into the crowd of boys]"
3001,6,10,Astronaut 1,Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over!
3002,6,10,Astronaut 2,"I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?!"
3003,6,10,Astronaut 1,"I don't want to live in this futuristic madness! [pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]"
3004,6,10,Astronaut 2,"Take your ape rule and go to hell! [pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]"
3005,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[sighs] Having boobs sucks.
3006,6,10,A Doctor,"Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today? [sits at his desk]"
3007,6,10,Bebe Stevens,I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. [the doctor leans forwards and visually inspects Bebe's chest]
3008,6,10,Dr Hallis,You?
3009,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
3010,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age."
3011,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
3012,6,10,Dr Hallis,Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.
3013,6,10,Bebe Stevens,I think it's insane to want them bigger.
3014,6,10,Dr Hallis,Why do you... hate your breasts so?
3015,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
3016,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Oh, come on now, that's just silly."
3017,6,10,Blonde Nurse,"[nice shape, walks in with a folder] Here's the Anderson file, Doctor."
3018,6,10,Dr Hallis,"[looks up, looks down and grins, then looks up again] Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thanks you so much. [The nurse walks out. Bebe lowers her eyelids halfway]"
3019,6,10,Brunette Nurse,"[not as nicely shaped, walks in with a cup and plate] And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor."
3020,6,10,Dr Hallis,"[quickly, subdued, looks askance] Yeah, whatever. Get out of here. [the nurse walks out, and he addresses Bebe again] Now, I was saying?"
3021,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want."
3022,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?"
3023,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero."
3024,6,10,Dr Hallis,"That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl."
3025,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Damnit!
3026,6,10,Dr Hallis,"If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?"
3027,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Oh, fuck off! [walks off in disgust]"
3028,6,10,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?"
3029,6,10,Randy Marsh,Why? What's the matter with him?
3030,6,10,Sharon Marsh,"It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. [Randy looks. In the living room Stan has taken out his crayons and drawn some figures on the wall]"
3031,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[disheveled, in his primal state] Aaaa-ta. [starts drawing another boob. The wall is covered with them, singly or in pairs. One stick-figure woman has a large pair] Aaaa-ta."
3032,6,10,Sharon Marsh,"He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why."
3033,6,10,Stan Marsh,[picks up a stick and moves it around] Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
3034,6,10,Randy Marsh,Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
3035,6,10,Sharon Marsh,[relieved and proud] Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. [Randy leaves his seat at the table and approaches Stan]
3036,6,10,Stan Marsh,"[points to the wall with his stick] Ahta. Ah, ahta!"
3037,6,10,Randy Marsh,"Hey there, son."
3038,6,10,Stan Marsh,[turns to face his father] Hoh? Ahta. [points to the wall] Ahta.
3039,6,10,Randy Marsh,"Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan."
3040,6,10,Stan Marsh,Ahta.
3041,6,10,Randy Marsh,"Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ""ahta"" will start becoming a major part of your life."
3042,6,10,Stan Marsh,Ahta? [Sharon walks behind Randy and sits on one of the sofa's arms]
3043,6,10,Randy Marsh,"But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever."
3044,6,10,Stan Marsh,[considers each argument] Friend. Ahta.
3045,6,10,Randy Marsh,"I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday, [places his left hand on Sharon's right shoulder. She smiles] you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most."
3046,6,10,Sharon Marsh,[putting her right arm around Randy] I love you.
3047,6,10,Randy Marsh,"If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all."
3048,6,10,Right Breast,The boys are at war. All is going as planned.
3049,6,10,Left Breast,Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees.
3050,6,10,Right Breast,We grow larger every day.
3051,6,10,Left Breast,And stronger.
3052,6,10,Right Breast,Soon the entire tow- [Bebe awakens]
3053,6,10,Left Breast,Sh! Sh! She's awake!
3054,6,10,Right Breast,"Ah, quiet."
3055,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[shrieks and kicks her blanket off] MOM!! MOM!!
3056,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"[rushes to Bebe's room and enters] What is it, Bebe?"
3057,6,10,Bebe Stevens,[scared] My breasts!
3058,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"[approaches the bed, sits, and holds her] Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady."
3059,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!"
3060,6,10,Mrs Stevens,"[beat] Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You're blossoming into a woman. [hugs her]"
3061,6,10,Bebe Stevens,That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
3062,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?"
3063,6,10,Wendy,Yes! I want to get breast implants!
3064,6,10,Mrs Testaburger,I tried to tell her she was too young.
3065,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant."
3066,6,10,Mrs Testaburger,[considers the doctor's argument...] But she's eight!
3067,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty."
3068,6,10,Wendy,That's what I said.
3069,6,10,Dr Hallis,"However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone. [takes out a notepad] I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go."
3070,6,10,Wendy,"I have three thousand dollars, cash. [her mom blanches]"
3071,6,10,Dr Hallis,"[quickly disposes of the pad and pen, then rises and leaves the desk] You pass. Let's do this thing."
3072,6,10,Mrs Testaburger,"[mortified] Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now?"
3073,6,10,Dr Hallis,Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure. [holds Wendy's right arm up and points to the armpit] What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.
3074,6,10,Mrs Testaburger,I still don't know about this.
3075,6,10,Dr Hallis,"Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?"
3076,6,10,Dr Hallis,"[shove] Cha! [shove] Gotta! [shove] Jam it! [shove] Up there! [shove] Get! [shove] In! [shove] There! [shove] You! [shove] Bitch! [shoves faster] Get! [shove] In! [shove] There! [shove] You! [shove] Bitch! [the implant is finally in place; everything is covered in blood] Hah! [wipes his brow] Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great."
3077,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades."
3078,6,10,Clyde Donovan,[in primal mode] Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! [he and a few others grunt a bit]
3079,6,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay? [the grunts start up again]"
3080,6,10,Bradley Biggle,Bebe! [more grunts.]
3081,6,10,Stan Marsh,Ahta! [more grunts. Bebe enters wearing a cardboard box over her clothes. The boys quiet down.]
3082,6,10,Bebe Stevens,"Hey guys. [a few boys grunt back with ""Hi!!"" ""Hey."" ""Hm."" as she heads for her seat. The boys are confused.]"
3083,6,10,Craig Tucker,Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? [Bebe smiles at her uncoolness]
3084,6,10,Token Black,Yeah. What the hell happened to us?
3085,6,10,Stan Marsh,Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
3086,6,10,Eric Cartman,Bebe's boobs?
3087,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Oh cool! It worked!
3088,6,10,Stan Marsh,Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
3089,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
3090,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Yes!
3091,6,10,Eric Cartman,"So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?"
3092,6,10,Bebe Stevens,Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.
3093,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
3094,6,10,Stan Marsh,"I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us."
3095,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!
3096,6,10,Craig Tucker,"I'm sorry for fighting, you guys. [all the boys leave their seats and start apologizing to each other, hugging each other]"
3097,6,10,Mr Mackey,"[moved by this display of affection] Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?"
3098,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Let's never let boobs come between us again!
3099,6,10,The Boys,Hear Hear!
3100,6,10,Kyle Broflovski,Boobs are stupid!
3101,6,10,Wendy,"[enters with her new, ample implants] Hi, everybody. [the boys look at her for a long while, then start laughing heartily. Wendy is stunned at the response]"
3102,6,10,Clyde Donovan,Look at those ridiculous things!
3103,6,10,Butters Stotch,"[steps up and touches the left breast] Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!"
3104,6,10,Eric Cartman,"What a stupid bitch! [the boys start laughing again. Butters is laughing hard, but realizes that his finger is still on Wendy's breast.]"
3105,6,11,News Anchor,"[News 4] And in other news, another school shooting has taken place, this time in Idaho. As these kinds of shooting increase, one thing becomes clear: Your children are not safe at school."
3106,6,11,Tweek Tweak,Oh God! [frantically fishes for the remote control] Change it! Change it! [finds it and changes channels]
3107,6,11,News Anchor,"[News 5] This was the second time a terrorist threat has been made on a theme park, leaving everyone to realize that children are not safe outside."
3108,6,11,Tweek Tweak,"Agh! God, change it!! [clicks through a few channels]"
3109,6,11,News Anchor,"[SNN, with weather bar at bottom] And it seems there's a new danger to look out for: children who are taken by strangers. The bottom line: children are not safe... in their own homes!"
3110,6,11,Tweek Tweak,[throws a fit] Aaaah!!
3111,6,11,Tweek s Mom,[arrives] Tweek.
3112,6,11,Tweek Tweak,Gahahghah
3113,6,11,Tweek s Mom,"Tweak? Come to the kitchen, sweetie. We need to see you real quick. [leaves. Tweek soon follows]"
3114,6,11,Tweek Tweak,Oh God. They're gonna get me.
3115,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Sit down and have some coffee, son. [Tweek climbs onto his seat and takes a sip, then several more] Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about kids being abducted, and we thought we should talk."
3116,6,11,Tweek Tweak,[points to the TV] I s-I saw! Uuuh!
3117,6,11,Tweek s Mom,"You know never to talk to strangers, right Tweek? You can't trust anybody."
3118,6,11,Tweek Tweak,[panting] Oh God! Huh!
3119,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. Important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I."
3120,6,11,Tweek Tweak,[panting] Oh Jesus! Huh!
3121,6,11,Tweek s Mom,"It's just a precaution, sweetie. Probably nothing will ever happen."
3122,6,11,Tweek Tweak,"No, ...NO! They're gonna get me! [wakes up] GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God. [holds himself] Uh, just a dream. [gasps. His bedroom windows are open and the curtains are softly blowing in the breeze] OH MY GOD!! [quickly jumps up and closes the windows. Four knocks are heard at the door] GAAAH!! [throws the blanket over his head. Two more knocks, and then]"
3123,6,11,Voice,"[on the other side of the door]Tweek! This is Officer Daniels! Now, try and stay calm, but we believe an abductor is in your room!"
3124,6,11,Tweek Tweak,...Inside my room? Oh God!
3125,6,11,Voice,"Give it up, buddy! We've got ya surrounded! Okay, Tweek, I want you to very calmly but quickly walk to the door and come out to us!"
3126,6,11,Tweek Tweak,"[thinks and looks around] Oh my God! [hops down and makes his way to the door] Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this. [opens the door and steps out, only to find a gun to his face. He gasps, then] AAAHH!"
3127,6,11,Voice,"Bang! [the gun is withdrawn] You're dead, Tweek. [the camera zooms out to show Mr. Tweek holding the gun]"
3128,6,11,Tweek Tweak,[look up bewildered] What?
3129,6,11,Richard Tweak,"You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I?"
3130,6,11,Tweek Tweak,[a bit panicked] Oh God! Oh Jesus!
3131,6,11,Tweek s Mom,"[walks up and stands next to Richard at the doorway] What if that had been a child abductor pretending to be a police officer, Tweek?"
3132,6,11,Richard Tweak,"He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods. [Tweek shakes his head in frustration and whimpers] You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest."
3133,6,11,Tweek s Mom,"'Night, pumpkin. [his dad closes the door and locks it, then the parents go off to bed. Tweek turns to go to bed, but looks distraught]"
3134,6,11,Stan Marsh,I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
3135,6,11,Kyle Broflovski,It will.
3136,6,11,Eric Cartman,[orders his ticket first] One please.
3137,6,11,Tweek Tweak,"[stopping Cartman] Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy!"
3138,6,11,Kyle Broflovski,So?
3139,6,11,Tweek Tweak,So? I don't know him!
3140,6,11,Eric Cartman,"Dude, relax."
3141,6,11,Tweek Tweak,You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! [runs away]
3142,6,11,Eric Cartman,"Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?"
3143,6,11,Lost Driver,"'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge."
3144,6,11,Tweek Tweak,[looks up] AAH! Uh...
3145,6,11,Lost Driver,"Please, I just need to know if this is ""South Park""?"
3146,6,11,Tweek Tweak,Get away from meee! [runs off again. The confused driver looks at him go]
3147,6,11,Elderly Lady,Could you help me across the street?
3148,6,11,Tweek Tweak,"I don't know you! [runs across the street] Ah, AAAH!"
3149,6,11,Man in Wheelchair,"Oh, hey, kid! [Tweek looks over] Oh, thank God you happened by. My- my chair ran out of juice right on these train tracks. If you hadn't had shown up, well... Well, anyway, could you give me a push?"
3150,6,11,Tweek Tweak,Huh uh!
3151,6,11,Man in Wheelchair,"No, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm paralyzed from the neck down. I push the chair with this device in front of my mouth, but it's it's not working, so you see-"
3152,6,11,Tweek Tweak,I'm not supposed to talk to you!
3153,6,11,Man in Wheelchair,"Please, this, this isn't funny, kid. You have to help me."
3154,6,11,Tweek Tweak,"But it could be a trick! [a train zooms by, taking the paralyzed man with it. Tweek watches it go by] Ugh. That's a pretty good trick."
3155,6,11,Tweek Tweak,AaaaAAAHH! [hides under his covers]
3156,6,11,Man in Wheelchair,"[speaking with authority] Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness."
3157,6,11,Tweek Tweak,[peeks out from behind the covers] The Ghost of Human Kindness?
3158,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),You have never seen the likes of me before.
3159,6,11,Tweek Tweak,What do you want?
3160,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"You have lost faith in humanity, lad. Something I cannot bear to see happen."
3161,6,11,Tweek Tweak,"Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me."
3162,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"That is the world of the news reports. It is the world that adults preoccupy themselves with, but it is not the world as it is."
3163,6,11,Tweek Tweak,It isn't?
3164,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"Look here, Tweek. This woman is on her way to the retirement home. [they arrive at the front door] She doesn't get paid; she volunteers her time to talk with lonely elderly people who want nothing more than a friend. [the woman hugs an elderly lady, then moves on to other folks.] But do you hear about her on the news? No."
3165,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"Now gaze upon this humble house, Tweek. Inside there are two people who have adopted needy children. [a close-up of a man reading to his baby. Two other kids, a Japanese girl and a black boy, sit on the floor listening. The mother arrives with drinks] They were strangers to those kids once. Now they are loving parents"
3166,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"Now, look here, boy. [a shot of a man changing the front left tire of a Cadillac for an elderly lady. A young woman stands ready with a spare tire] A car has broken down with a flat tire, and two complete strangers have stopped to help. [the man signals for the tire, the woman rolls it to him] Will their kindness be reported on the news tomorrow? I think not."
3167,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"Are you starting to understand, boy?"
3168,6,11,Tweek Tweak,"I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world."
3169,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"That's right, lad. So do you think you can learn to trust people now?"
3170,6,11,Tweek Tweak,I'll... try.
3171,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"Good. Then why don't you get into the back of my van, and I'll drive you home. [the camera pans to a dirty dilapidated van]"
3172,6,11,Tweek Tweak,Your van? [flashlights click on and focus on the ghost and at least five squad cars pull up to the two people]
3173,6,11,Officer 1,"Alright Johnson, give it up!"
3174,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"[strikes his scepter to the ground with each expletive] Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! [four officers close in with guns drawn. Tweek steps aside] Oh, I was so close!"
3175,6,11,Tweek Tweak,What the hell is going on?
3176,6,11,Tweek s Mom,"Tweek, Tweek, are you okay?"
3177,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Did he hurt you, son?"
3178,6,11,Tweek Tweak,No
3179,6,11,Police Officers and Detective,Then we aren't too late. His name is Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting children by dressing up like the Ghost of Human Kindness for over a year now.
3180,6,11,The Ghost of Human Kindness (Frederick Johnson),"And I would have gotten away with it again if it weren't for you meddling policemen! [the policemen escort him away. A wide shot shows the Stotches, the Williamses and the Marshes viewing the arrest in their pajamas. Liane Cartman walks up in her gown. She's wearing a facial treatment mask]"
3181,6,11,Liane Cartman,What's going on?
3182,6,11,Sharon Marsh,A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.
3183,6,11,Sheila Broflovski,[the Broflovskis arrive in their pajamas] An abductor in our town?
3184,6,11,Tom Tucker,"Oh my God, what are we gonna do?"
3185,6,11,Townsfolk,Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
3186,6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"People, people, calm down."
3187,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!"
3188,6,11,Townsfolk,Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
3189,6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, but standing out here yelling ""Rabble rabble rabble"" isn't going to help anything."
3190,6,11,Jimbo Kern,"Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!"
3191,6,11,Townsfolk,Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble.
3192,6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"People, what do you think we need to do?"
3193,6,11,Gerald Broflovski,"[thinks] Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!"
3194,6,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids."
3195,6,11,Townsfolk,Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
3196,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in."
3197,6,11,Richard Tweak,"That's... not a bad idea, a city wall."
3198,6,11,Sheila Broflovski,But who can we get to build it?
3199,6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city."
3200,6,11,City Wok Owner,I don' build wall. I just own un' operate City Wok.
3201,6,11,Gerald Broflovski,We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
3202,6,11,City Wok Owner,"[thinks a moment] Oh, I get it. Just because I Chinese, you think I build wall. That i' bullshit! I'm not stereotype, okay?! Just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I go around building wall! I'm just a normal person like all o'you! I eat ahrice and drive ahreally slow, just like the rest o'you! I'm not stereotype!"
3203,6,11,Sharon Marsh,"Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim."
3204,6,11,Randy Marsh,Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
3205,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Hey. Hey hey! [rushes over to the gap the Mongolians are creating] Hey, what the hell you doing?! [the Mongolian leader says a few words] Mongorians? What the hell Mongorians doing here? [the Mongolians keep attacking the wall] Ey, fuck you, Mongorians! Tryin' break down my wall! [starts throwing bricks at the Mongolians] Get out of here, fuckin' Mongorians! [the Mongolians turn and ride away] God-damnit, how come every time us Chinese put up a wall, stupid Mongorians have to come and knock it down?"
3206,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker."
3207,6,11,Stan Marsh,Child Tracker?
3208,6,11,Sharon Marsh,It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
3209,6,11,Randy Marsh,"If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters."
3210,6,11,Randy Marsh,"There, I think that's got it. [Stan is now wearing a very elaborate helmet with several antennae, a red light, and a small satellite dish sitting on top.]"
3211,6,11,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!"
3212,6,11,Randy Marsh,You can barely even tell you have one on.
3213,6,11,Stan Marsh,I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
3214,6,11,Sharon Marsh,I wouldn't worry about that.
3215,6,11,Eric Cartman,"So weak. So weak, dude. Man."
3216,6,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!"
3217,6,11,Tweek Tweak,I didn't mean to.
3218,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay. Finary. [looks around] Oh no. [picks up a telescope, with ""Mongolian Telescope written on it and looks through it. He finds the Mongolians attacking the wall at a position far off] It's those God-damned Mongorians again! Stop! Stop right there, Mongorians! [a shot from inside a tower of Tuong running down the rampart] God-damnit, stop! [a far shot of Tuong running down the rampart] Stop breaking down my city wall you stupid Mongoriaaans! [finally arrives at the source of the noise] Ay, you sons of bitches, you- [sees a ruse. Clothes were placed on twigs and a tape player plays a recording of Mongolian noises] What the hell? [straightens up] Oh, shit! [looks off to his right to see the Mongolians attacking the part of the wall he was at before] OH, GOD-DAMNED MONGORIANS!! [runs back along the rampart to the Mongolians] I'm gonna get you, fuckin' Mongorians! Don't break down my city wall! [reaches the new gap and the Mongolians ride away] Oh, God-damnit! [the Mongolian leader says something. Tuong calls out after them] That's the last time you're gonna break down my city wall! You hear me, Mongorians?! [goes about repairing the wall] God-damned Mongorians."
3219,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell! [the boys are wearing their Child Trackers. Cartman is the catcher, Stan is the pitcher]"
3220,6,11,Kyle Broflovski,"But, wait. Where's the other team? [the field is shown. The opposing bullpen is empty and there are no opposing players on the field. There's no visiting team out there.]"
3221,6,11,Randy Marsh,There is no other team.
3222,6,11,Stan Marsh,Huh?
3223,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?"
3224,6,11,Stan Marsh,"But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun."
3225,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. [takes a sip of his beer. Richard sips from his beer can, then other townsfolk in the bleachers sip from their beer cans. The Cows take positions on the field]"
3226,6,11,Townsfolk,Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows!
3227,6,11,Jimbo Kern,"[umpire] Play ball! [Stan looks at the people in the stands, then pitches to Cartman] Steeeeee-riiike"
3228,6,11,Townsfolk,[standing and cheering] Yeah! Woohoo! Yeah!
3229,6,11,Jimbo Kern,[raises a mug of beer] South Park Cows do it again!
3230,6,11,Sharon Marsh,"Congratulations on your victory, boys. [Cartman is already eating a slice of pizza]"
3231,6,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we weren't playing anybody."
3232,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, and you kicked ass!"
3233,6,11,Mr Donovan,Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall around our city? Nobody in town except for our good friends.
3234,6,11,Townsfolk,Yeahah! Alright! Yeah. Right on! Right on!
3235,6,11,Richard Tweak,"[calling attention to the TV] Guys! Sh, quiet everyone. [the news is on]"
3236,6,11,News Anchor,"[in gray jacket] And this newest study reveals more about child abductions than we apparently knew before, Tom. [the adults move closer to the TV]"
3237,6,11,Sharon Marsh,Turn it up.
3238,6,11,Tom Tucker,"[in brown jacket] That's right, Chris. This newest study shows that the majority of child abductions are NOT committed by strangers, but by somebody the child knows in their own town. [the adults start looking at the others around them, at each other.] The report further states that it is because the child trusts the individual that problems occur in the first place."
3239,6,11,Chris,"Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak."
3240,6,11,Tom Tucker,"Sure does, Tom."
3241,6,11,Chris,"Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- [click. The parents go to their kids and they depart one by one]"
3242,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now. [takes Tweek, and the family leaves. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman remain, eating]"
3243,6,11,Gerald Broflovski,"[walks up] Yeah. Come along, Kyle [the Broflovskis leave. Stan and Cartman remain]"
3244,6,11,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, time for us to get back to the house."
3245,6,11,Stan Marsh,[mouth full] I'm not done with my pizza.
3246,6,11,Sharon Marsh,"NOW, Stanley! [whisks him off. Randy follows, looking at Cartman, left all alone with his mom]"
3247,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Eh. Eh, eh, there we go. [pulls out a large weapon] All finished. My Mongolian Missile Defense system. [a bazooka reading ""MONGOLIAN ERADICATOR."" He mounts it on his shoulder and takes aim. Next, he sets it down and drops a missile into it] Those Mongolians try to break down my city wall again, they gonna get a big heat-seeking missile surprise! [hoofbeats are heard and the Mongolians are once again present and ready to attack. Tuong sees them and taunts them] Oh! Hello Mongolians. Yeah. You come to break down my city wall? [the leader holds out a baseball] Oh, you gonna throw that baseball at my wall? [feigns despair] Oh no! Not a baseball! I'm pretty scared. [the leader tosses the ball in the air straight up] Well, you know what? I might have something here that's a little bigger than a baseball. [arms himself with the bazooka, setting it at hip level] Say hello to my little friend! [fires the missile and watches it go towards the Mongolians. One of the Mongolians pours gasoline on the ball. The leader reaches back to get a lighter from another Mongolian and sets the ball on fire. The missile gets close to them. The leader throws the ball at Tuong and the missile follows the ball. The ball hits the wall and drops to the snow. Tuong realizes what this means] Aw, crap. [the missile strikes the ball and blows a new gap into the great wall. After the smoke clears, Tuong is lying in the rubble, clearly hurt] Ooohhhh [the leader draws his sword and the Mongolians have a good laugh about this incident. Then they turn and ride off, laughing.] God-damned Mongolians!! You break down my city wall foda last time!!"
3248,6,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker."
3249,6,11,Richard Tweak,"'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here."
3250,6,11,Sharon Marsh,Right. Do what you normally would do.
3251,6,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[volunteers] You're such a fatass, Cartman."
3252,6,11,Eric Cartman,At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
3253,6,11,Sheila Broflovski,What what whaaat?
3254,6,11,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place? [a shot of the class with all parents present] Uh, how about you, Clyde?"
3255,6,11,Mr Donovan,[whispers into Clyde's ear] Nineteen six-
3256,6,11,Mr Mackey,"No helping! [Mr. Donovan looks around, embarrassed, and stands up] M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay?"
3257,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Well, maybe things could be better if we could trust people like the Stotches!"
3258,6,11,Chris,Us? Your family's all be the shifty-eyed ones!
3259,6,11,Richard Tweak,Oh yeah?! [the other parents begin to bicker]
3260,6,11,Mr Mackey,"Oh, this is too much to take. [goes to his desk, where his own parents wait, and sits down.] Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone?"
3261,6,11,Mr Mackey s Father,"We just wanna make sure nobody hurts you, Junior, m'kay?"
3262,6,11,Mr Mackey,M'kay.
3263,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Hahahaha! My masterpiece! [stirs his concoction] When those Mongolians come next time, I pour this sweet and sour pork on their heads. Haha, sweet and sour pork so hot and sticky, Mongolians'll stick ahright up to the wall! And scream ""UhwOoOoOoOoo!"" Oh I can't wait. [hears something to his left. He looks and sees a wooden horse on wheels rolling up to the gate. He studies the horse and tries to think what to make of it] Oh, I get it. A Trojan Mongolian horse. Mongolians a-hiding inside thinking that I'll bring it in city wall, then Mongolians pop out and destroy wall from the inside out without gettin' any sweet and sour pork on their heads! Okay. I'll pray around. [starts to feign gratitude, moves to the rampart above the gate] Oh! Oh rook! Rook, my very own Mongorian Trojan horse! Gee, what a surprise! I guess Mongorians aren't such crappy, smelly people after all! [makes his way down the stairs near a tower and reaches the side door] Yeah. Great! Rwow! [opens the side door and walks over to the horse carrying a fireman's ax.] Yeah, what a great present! I'm just gonna push it inside the gate and soon tell all my friends. [pulls down a door handle under the horse. Two doors open above him and release some seweet and sour pork on him, forcing him to the ground. He finds it hard to move around] Oh, it's sweet and sour pork! [The Mongolians ride up again and attack the wall with their swords. Tuong speaks, but his words become less familiar, due to the stickiness of the sauce] Oh! I'm going to get you Nogodians, if it's the last thing I do!"
3264,6,11,News Anchor,"[News 4] And so all the residents of Manhattan are prepared to evacuate if Ms. Clinton's ass gets any bigger. And in other news, new findings on the increase in child abductions."
3265,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!"
3266,6,11,News Anchor,"The study shows that the most likely abductors of children... are the parents themselves! [the two adults are somewhat stunned] The study reveals that nine out of every ten abduction cases are committed by the child's mother or father. The bottom line being that your children aren't safe, even from you! [Tweek's mom rises from the couch and walks away from it. Richard watches her go]"
3267,6,11,Richard Tweak,Where are you going?
3268,6,11,Mrs Tweek,Uh. I'm just going to go upstairs and see if Tweek is still in his bed.
3269,6,11,Richard Tweak,Oh? [puts the popcorn and blanket aside and rises] I think I'll go with you.
3270,6,11,Mrs Tweek,It's okay. I can do it.
3271,6,11,Richard Tweak,I just want to make sure that you-
3272,6,11,Mrs Tweek,That I don't abduct him? How do I know that you haven't done it already?
3273,6,11,Richard Tweak,Me? I would never abduct our son!
3274,6,11,Mrs Tweek,That's not what the new study says!
3275,6,11,Richard Tweak,"[wipes his forehead, then] Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves? [both parents look upstairs]"
3276,6,11,Randy Marsh,"[hands Stan some money] Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years."
3277,6,11,Stan Marsh,But why do I have to leave?
3278,6,11,Randy Marsh,"The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you."
3279,6,11,Sharon Marsh,"Good-bye, son. [hugs Stan and sobs softly] Remember to eat right."
3280,6,11,Gerald Broflovski,"[wistfully] Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now."
3281,6,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! [Gerald hugs Kyle, Sheila hugs Ike. They begin to cry, and the other adults follow. They leave their kids and huddle, then turn around, crying all the while]"
3282,6,11,Linda Stotch,Be careful out there!
3283,6,11,Stan Marsh,Where are we supposed to go?
3284,6,11,Randy Marsh,We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! [turns back to cry with Sharon]
3285,6,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, this is terrible! [turns and cries with Gerald]"
3286,6,11,Mr Donovan,"Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back! [turns and hugs his wife. The adults are bawling now. Token is the first to leave, and the other kids follow him]"
3287,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. [the adults continue crying. Chris pulls out a ram's horn and blows into it a few times]"
3288,6,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid."
3289,6,11,A woman,"[in the crowd, crying] Oh my God."
3290,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Ah. Hey daw. O'er 'ere. O'er 'ere, dog. Got som'in sweet and souh foh ya. [the dog walks over and starts licking the sauce away] Good dog! That's it! Keep licking, dog!"
3291,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians! And now I'm gonna make you PAY!"
3292,6,11,News Anchor,"Finally, some good news tonight. It's been several days since any child abductions have taken place. The main reason: parents don't know where their children are. [Sharon, at the window, sighs. Randy turns and looks at her. Snow flakes float down outside]"
3293,6,11,Randy Marsh,What's the matter? [stands up]
3294,6,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay."
3295,6,11,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to her] Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. [puts his hand on her back]"
3296,6,11,Sharon Marsh,"Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town to live on their own?"
3297,6,11,Randy Marsh,"[faces her, makes her face him] Sweetheart, you saw the news..."
3298,6,11,Sharon Marsh,I know. [they turn back to the window]
3299,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves."
3300,6,11,Leader,Tah tane da ke ab kahleh kalabush.
3301,6,11,Stan Marsh,"Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. [the Mongolians laugh]"
3302,6,11,Mongolian,[in blue] De bandig baeakhalah?
3303,6,11,Eric Cartman,Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
3304,6,11,Tweek Tweak,Triben fak burushban.
3305,6,11,All,Shain balag!
3306,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Awright, Mongolians! Your only way through this wall is through me. This is my rast stand! I'm gonna do my war dance now. [begins a chant and dances for a few seconds, then stops] Does my war dance ascare you, Mongolians? Yeah, you think you want a piece of this? [resumes his dance. Seeing Tuong engrossed in his dance, the children move some explosives to a spot against the wall. Token peeks to make sure everything is in place. The kids then walk back to the Mongolians, past Tuong...] This is ancient Chinese dance of a- Oh, herro kids. Uh be careful, there's a-Mongolians up there. [resumes his dance as the kids line up before the Mongolians. Stan hands the detonator to the Mongolian leader, who holds it for a while. Tuong notices the wire stretching between the Mongolians and the explosives against the wall] Oh, crap! [the explosives blow up, knocking Tuong towards the Mongolians and leaving a big gap in the wall. The kids and the Mongolians have a good laugh. The adults in town come to see the commotion]"
3307,6,11,Randy Marsh,What's going on?
3308,6,11,Liane Cartman,I heard an explosion.
3309,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"[battered, comes into view] God-damned Mongolians attacked city wall again! [The kids and the Mongolians have a good laugh again.]"
3310,6,11,Man in Back,Mongolians?
3311,6,11,Randy Marsh,What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
3312,6,11,Adults,Rabble rabble rabble rabble!
3313,6,11,Richard Tweak,Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children. [a shot of the kids and Mongolians]
3314,6,11,Sheila Broflovski,Ike? Kyle?
3315,6,11,Sharon Marsh,My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! [buries her head in Randy's chest]
3316,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are."
3317,6,11,Mr Donovan,Kids? Don't you remember us?
3318,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college. [steps forth] Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro."
3319,6,11,Stan Marsh,"[""Budu e noo""] Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. [squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his right hand]"
3320,6,11,Randy Marsh,Bi kute.
3321,6,11,Mr Donovan,"We are your parents. You used to live here, with us."
3322,6,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it was like four days ago!"
3323,6,11,Richard Tweak,They're starting to remember.
3324,6,11,Randy Marsh,[walks quickly and kneels next to Stan] Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!
3325,6,11,Stan Marsh,"Uh huh, Stan Marsh."
3326,6,11,Randy Marsh,"[holds Stan firmly] That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! [the rest of the parents rush out and hug their own kids, crying in relief]"
3327,6,11,Richard Tweak,"We're sorry, Tweek!"
3328,6,11,Mr Donovan,"Are you okay, Clyde?"
3329,6,11,Chris,"[Butters' parents hug the wrong person - the Mongolian leader] Oh, son, can you ever forgive us?"
3330,6,11,Butters Stotch,"Huh, I'm over here, Dad."
3331,6,11,Chris,Oh. [he and Linda rush to hug him]
3332,6,11,Sheila Broflovski,"We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads."
3333,6,11,Richard Tweak,"Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along."
3334,6,11,Mr Donovan,"You mean how he said we should trust each other, or how he abducted children?"
3335,6,11,Richard Tweak,"The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did."
3336,6,11,Adults,"Wow, yeah. Oh yeah."
3337,6,11,Randy Marsh,"No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians. [a shot of the Mongolians] They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together."
3338,6,11,Adults,Whoa! Wow. Right!
3339,6,11,Chris,"Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah."
3340,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Aw, you'd better not say what I think you're gonna say."
3341,6,11,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!"
3342,6,11,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh, God! I hate this whole shitty!"
3343,6,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, can we just take our son home now?"
3344,6,11,Randy Marsh,"Yes, kids. [steps forward] With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. [all turn and walk towards town through the gap in the great wall]"
3345,6,11,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. [faces forward and continues walking]"
3346,6,12,Lolly,"[notices the kids and straightens up] Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's Candy Shop."
3347,6,12,Stan Marsh,We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
3348,6,12,Lolly,Oh that's great!
3349,6,12,Eric Cartman,You bet your fat clown ass it is!
3350,6,12,Lolly,Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub.
3351,6,12,Eric Cartman,[the boys' jaws drop a bit] ...ticket stub?
3352,6,12,Lolly,You know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket. [display the store's half of the ticket]
3353,6,12,Stan Marsh,Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
3354,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,It was such a long time ago!
3355,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we?"
3356,6,12,Lolly,Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners?
3357,6,12,Stan Marsh,Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
3358,6,12,Lolly,"Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called ""The Ticking Clock."" Works great in the movies. [steps backwards into the store and closes the door. The boys look at the door for a few seconds, then Cartman turns and steps forward]"
3359,6,12,Eric Cartman,[drops the buckets] GODDAMMIT!!!
3360,6,12,Stan Marsh,We've gotta find that ticket!
3361,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember."
3362,6,12,Eric Cartman,"You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. [Zoom in on Cartman, who starts remembering...]"
3363,6,12,Lolly,[hands a ticket stub to Stan] All right. There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. You'll need it to claim your prize. [looks at the rest of the store] Sign up for the five-minute shopping spree!! [walks off]
3364,6,12,Stan Marsh,"[hands the stub to Cartman] You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it."
3365,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle."
3366,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [hands the stub to Kenny]"
3367,6,12,Kenny,(Okay.) [takes it and pockets it]
3368,6,12,Eric Cartman,[bolts away] Kenny!!!
3369,6,12,Stan Marsh,[following quickly] AAAHHH!! [the buckets stay on the ground and the boys rush to Kenny's house]
3370,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,[following quickly] AAAHHH!! [the buckets stay on the ground and the boys rush to Kenny's house]
3371,6,12,Stuart McCormick,[opens the door] Yes?
3372,6,12,Stan Marsh,Where's Kenny??
3373,6,12,Stuart McCormick,Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
3374,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??"
3375,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"His body? Well, why??"
3376,6,12,Eric Cartman,Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
3377,6,12,Stan Marsh,"[shuts Cartman up quick and stumbles for words] Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure."
3378,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Closure.
3379,6,12,Eric Cartman,[muffled] What the fuck is closure?!
3380,6,12,Kenny s Mom,Oh all right boys. Come on in. [the boys follow the McCormicks in]
3381,6,12,Stuart McCormick,"We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him."
3382,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny. [an urn is shown, with pictures of Kenny on either side of it.]"
3383,6,12,Eric Cartman,You turned him into a teapot?
3384,6,12,Stuart McCormick,"No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it."
3385,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"Your friends are here to see you, Kenny. [picks up the urn and caresses it.] They miss you an awful lot, like we all do. [starts crying]"
3386,6,12,Stuart McCormick,"Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us. [turns to his wife and consoles her] Aw now, honey. [joins her in sobbing]"
3387,6,12,Eric Cartman,Wewewewewewe...
3388,6,12,Stan Marsh,[climbs up to the window and looks in] Did you get it? [Kyle climbs up next to him]
3389,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards. [resumes the detection] Wewewewewewe..."
3390,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! [Cartman looks back at the boys angrily, gets Kenny's urn, and climbs back out the window. Seconds later, a robot guard does indeed move through the living room...]"
3391,6,12,Robot Guard,Wewewewewewe...
3392,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, we made it!"
3393,6,12,Stan Marsh,Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
3394,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Let him out, Cartman! [Cartman opens the urn and the boys duck]"
3395,6,12,Eric Cartman,...Kenny? [the boys lose their fear and rise up to look at the urn] Kenny?!
3396,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Is he in there?
3397,6,12,Stan Marsh,I can't see. [Cartman pours out the ashes and the boys sneeze from the fine powder until it dissipates. Some ash smudges remain on their faces.]
3398,6,12,Eric Cartman,What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
3399,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! [Cartman samples the ashes]
3400,6,12,Stan Marsh,It was a trick!
3401,6,12,Eric Cartman,God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
3402,6,12,Stan Marsh,Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
3403,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
3404,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!"
3405,6,12,Stan Marsh,We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! [gets off his stool and walks away.]
3406,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit! There has to be a way! [leaves his stool and follows Kyle out. Cartman looks at the ashes, then thinks of something]"
3407,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Hmmm. [leaves his stool and returns with some milk, a glass, and a spoon. He scoops up some ashes and drops them into the glass. He pours the milk onto the ashes, stirs them up, and drinks the milk ] Hmm, not bad. [scoops some more ashes into the milk]"
3408,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! [the dream ends abruptly]"
3409,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[sits up, eyes wide open] Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. [growls a bit, turns to sleep, and farts. The door flies open and Stan and Kyle rush in]"
3410,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, come on!"
3411,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[sits up again] What what? [sees who it is] Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!"
3412,6,12,Stan Marsh,Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
3413,6,12,Eric Cartman,How?
3414,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"A ladder to heaven. [unfolds some blueprints] We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny."
3415,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor."
3416,6,12,Stan Marsh,"[going for some more wood] We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven."
3417,6,12,Randy Marsh,"A ladder to heaven? Why, son?"
3418,6,12,Stan Marsh,Because we wanna see Kenny again. [heaves a piece of wood back to the tower]
3419,6,12,Sharon Marsh,"[after a moment of though] Oh... oh, that's so sweet."
3420,6,12,Randy Marsh,That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
3421,6,12,Jimbo Kern,"[approaching] Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh... [sees the boys' activity] What the hell are they doing?"
3422,6,12,Randy Marsh,"The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven."
3423,6,12,Jimbo Kern,Awwww.
3424,6,12,Sheila Broflovski,"[arriving with Gerald] Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough."
3425,6,12,Randy Marsh,"No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny."
3426,6,12,Jimbo Kern,A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God. [begins to sob]
3427,6,12,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, that's so touching. [begins to sob. All the adults begin to cry. The boys continue building]"
3428,6,12,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to- [chokes as the camera reaches the tower, then gathers himself] a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again. [sighs] It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say."
3429,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work... [begins to break down] if he... built the ladder to heaven."
3430,6,12,Sheila Broflovski,"[sobbing] They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!"
3431,6,12,Jimbo Kern,"[wistful] It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. [starts sobbing. Other people are show crying: Marietta Kitchin, Carrie Ayers & Steve Stegman]"
3432,6,12,Mr Garrison,A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.
3433,6,12,Mayor McDaniels,[sobbing with her aides] These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
3434,6,12,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, people from all over the- [chokes] Sorry. [gets back on track] People from all over the country are coming to see the ladder, feeling a connection to its symbolism, and beauty. Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder. [camera pulls back to show Jackson to the reporter's left, strumming a guitar] Alan Jackson is, of course, the man who wrote the song, ""Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning,"" about the tragedies on September 11. And now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions. Let's listen in. [focus shifts to Jackson]"
3435,6,12,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when they built the ladder to heaven? 
Did it make you feel like cryin', or did you think it was kind of gay?"
3436,6,12,Townsman,What a beautiful song. [the boys look down at Jackson]
3437,6,12,Alan Jackson,"Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11
[the townsfolk begin to cry]
I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___
Eleven.

Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here! [the crowd rushes in to get copies of the CD. Jackson is pleased at the interest. The boys resume their construction. Stan and Kyle are hammering away at the top of the ladder. Cartman hustles up the ladder with a car seat]"
3438,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
3439,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. [hands it to the other two boys, who put it in place]"
3440,6,12,Stan Marsh,Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
3441,6,12,Eric Cartman,...No. [the boys let the seat drop] Ey! Euuugh.
3442,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! [the dream ends abruptly]"
3443,6,12,Stuart McCormick,"Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys? [shows Kenny a centerfold, which shows a circle where the centerfold's crotch should be. He lifts the centerfold high enough to look through the hole] Kenny?! Answer me!! [back to the present - Cartman looks dazed]"
3444,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman? Cartman?!
3445,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[startled] Wha-uh, what?? What?"
3446,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!"
3447,6,12,Eric Cartman,I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
3448,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe you got brain cancer.
3449,6,12,Eric Cartman,Do you think?
3450,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!"
3451,6,12,SNN Reporter,"The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend. [a picture of the boys on the ladder is shown] It's making Americans start to believe in heaven, again. [next segment has the reporter out on the street]"
3452,6,12,Woman 1,"Well when I see how this ladder has brought people together, how... how it has changed America, I mean, how can I not believe?"
3453,6,12,SNN Reporter,[off screen] Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder to heaven?
3454,6,12,Fat Man,"If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy, and the ladder is my penis... [the camera moves away quickly, but the man keeps up] and the pearly gates are the- [static... the camera pulls back to show the reporter back at the desk, holding a TV status pattern on paper and hissing. He notices the camera and stops, putting the pattern down]"
3455,6,12,SNN Reporter,"Uh, meanwhile, the American economy cont- [gets some breaking news over his headset] wait. Wait. Wait a minute. We are getting reports now that Japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the US's. Let's go live to SNN correspondent Nobuhiro Sabasurisurijuwa."
3456,6,12,"Nobunaga Hiroichi, SNN Japanese Correspondent","This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben. [the tower is shown with klieg lights bathing it in light] Ahready, the Japanese radder extend faaar into space [the ladder is now high enough for a space shuttle to park by and astronauts come out to work on it] and it's growing by a-one thousand miles every day. [back on the ground...] As the endeavor continues it is becoming clear that Japan will reach a-hayben before the United States. [a raspberry follows]"
3457,6,12,Neighbors,Nahurabo Nahurabo
3458,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Excuse me. [""Nahurabo""] Excuse me! [""Nahurabo""] Uh, we ran out of stuff. [the singing abruptly stops] We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with."
3459,6,12,Man 1,Oh no!
3460,6,12,Woman 2,"Oh Jesus, no!"
3461,6,12,Alan Jackson,Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven?
3462,6,12,Stan Marsh,"We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood."
3463,6,12,Randy Marsh,"[raises his arms high] No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough."
3464,6,12,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. [a truck is heard arriving]"
3465,6,12,Man 2,"[at the back, by the fence] Wait! Look! [a fleet of trucks, cars, and jeeps converge on the road outside the house]"
3466,6,12,General,"We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys! [behind him, military personnel bring out ladders and other construction equipment] There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today! [the crowd cheers wildly. The boys' parents are dumbstruck] Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon! [the teams set about their duties]"
3467,6,12,Soldiers,Yes sir!
3468,6,12,Alan Jackson,Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?
3469,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[with Cartman at the top of the ladder] Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back."
3470,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle."
3471,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Do you see anything?
3472,6,12,Stan Marsh,No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
3473,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Grandma??
3474,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[joins the other two boys, grunting as he gets into position] Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!"
3475,6,12,Stan Marsh,"No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off."
3476,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough."
3477,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
3478,6,12,Eric Cartman,Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
3479,6,12,Stan Marsh,What??
3480,6,12,Eric Cartman,"You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O."
3481,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,[processes the comment] What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
3482,6,12,Eric Cartman,Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
3483,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
3484,6,12,Eric Cartman,Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
3485,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,HAAHH!!! [smacks Cartman on the side of the face with his left fist]
3486,6,12,Eric Cartman,"AH! [stunned, he has another flashback. A heartbeat is heard]"
3487,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Kenny.
3488,6,12,Stan Marsh,Hey Kenny.
3489,6,12,Kenny,(We can watch it at my house.)
3490,6,12,Eric Cartman,"In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto"
3491,6,12,Kenny,"[points an accusing finger at Cartman] (Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)"
3492,6,12,Eric Cartman,What did you say?!
3493,6,12,Kenny,"(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)"
3494,6,12,Eric Cartman,What did you say?!
3495,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[in the present] I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!"" [opens his eyes and looks around] Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?"
3496,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??"
3497,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes."
3498,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,You're too fat to be Kenny.
3499,6,12,Eric Cartman,[amid his thoughts] You're a- stupid Jew.
3500,6,12,Stan Marsh,Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
3501,6,12,George W. Bush,"Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese."
3502,6,12,General,"Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein."
3503,6,12,George W. Bush,Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago!
3504,6,12,General,Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.
3505,6,12,George W. Bush,"Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop!"
3506,6,12,General,"[flips a page on an easel, showing another page with three identical photos] These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven. [points out an encircled object in the center photo] Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here [points out an encircled object in the lower photo] we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons."
3507,6,12,Dick Cheney,That... kinda looks like a seagull.
3508,6,12,General,Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.
3509,6,12,George W. Bush,That tricky bastard!
3510,6,12,General,"Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must... [close-up] bomb heaven!"
3511,6,12,SNN Reporter,"SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans believe in heaven, should we bomb it? The polls right now show that 51% of Americans think Saddam has to be dealt with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies."
3512,6,12,War Protester,"[in tie-dye shirt, waving a ""No War On Heaven"" sign] War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!"
3513,6,12,Redneck,"[with baby dangling from the left hand, rifle firmly in the right hand] We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves."
3514,6,12,Fat Man,"I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States... [the mic is retracted] then there would- [the cameraman tries to avoid the man, but nope] hard nipples!"
3515,6,12,SNN Reporter,[back in the newsroom] God-damnit! [holds up the snow pattern and hisses]
3516,6,12,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action."
3517,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but..."
3518,6,12,Gerald Broflovski,But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
3519,6,12,Stan Marsh,"No, we have to see Kenny!"
3520,6,12,Sharon Marsh,You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.
3521,6,12,Stan Marsh,Cremated? What's that?
3522,6,12,Randy Marsh,"When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. [the boys are alarmed]"
3523,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What?? For God's sake, why??"
3524,6,12,Sheila Broflovski,"[half-annoyed] Kyle, it's just what some people do."
3525,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Are you gonna burn me?
3526,6,12,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, that's not the issue right now."
3527,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ!
3528,6,12,Randy Marsh,"The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is."
3529,6,12,Kenny s Mom,"You see boys, Kenny is in here. [opens the urn and pours out the contents, which are white now. Mrs. McCormick notices] What the??? [looks inside the urn] Wait a minute! This is kitty litter!"
3530,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[resigned, comes clean] Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter."
3531,6,12,Stuart McCormick,You WHAT??
3532,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!"
3533,6,12,Eric Cartman,[knowingly] Shut up!
3534,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"You did, dude! You drank his whole body!"
3535,6,12,Eric Cartman,[knowingly] Shut up!
3536,6,12,Kenny s Mom,Oh my God! This is awful! [starts moving away. The other adults follow] And disgusting!
3537,6,12,Liane Cartman,"[stops and looks at Cartman] Bad, Eric, bad! [moves away]"
3538,6,12,Eric Cartman,That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
3539,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! [leaves the table]"
3540,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Good job, fatass! [leaves the table]"
3541,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body."
3542,6,12,Eric Cartman,Looks like I've come to the right place.
3543,6,12,Unplanned Parenthood Nurse,Can I help you?
3544,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please."
3545,6,12,Unplanned Parenthood Nurse,You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
3546,6,12,Eric Cartman,Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! [a woman and her boyfriend enter the clinic. The woman sobs]
3547,6,12,Boyfriend,"It's gonna be okay, babe."
3548,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me! [the woman can't believe what she's hearing] I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!"
3549,6,12,Woman,"Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! [walks away from the clinic]"
3550,6,12,Steven,"Damnit! Damnit! [turns and walks off, then looks back in] Thanks a lot, kid! [throws a rock at Cartman]"
3551,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Eh! [becomes catatonic once more, and another flashback comes]"
3552,6,12,Eric Cartman,[Kenny! Kenny! kenny...
3553,6,12,Stan Marsh,[Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree! [the last few words echo a few times]
3554,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,[We're all gonna pitch in on an entry! [the last few words echo a few times. Fast forward to the day the boys are at Lolly's]
3555,6,12,Lolly,[Alright! [rips a ticket in half and hands the stub to Stan] There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. [the last few words echo a few times. He gives the ticket to Stan and walks off]
3556,6,12,Stan Marsh,"[[hands the stub to Cartman] Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. [the last few words echo a few times]"
3557,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle..."
3558,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [the last word echoes a few times. He hands the stub to Kenny]"
3559,6,12,Kenny,"[(Okay!) [the word echoes a few times. He takes it and pockets it. Fast forward to some time later, on the sidewalk]"
3560,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts! [fast forward to Kenny's room. He walks to a locked box by the window while looking at the ticket stub. He unlocks it, puts the ticket in, and locks the box again.]"
3561,6,12,Eric Cartman,The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere! [walks up to a couple filling out paperwork] Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God! [heads out the door] You guys! YOU GUYS!!
3562,6,12,George W. Bush,"Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction. [shows a picture of the ladder and another one of the clouds. Both pictures have areas circled in] We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But he has not ""re-spond-ed""."
3563,6,12,Indian Ambassador,"Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD!"
3564,6,12,George W. Bush,"Right. Dead, and in heaven."
3565,6,12,Another Ambassador,"This is preposterous! Even if there was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there?"
3566,6,12,George W. Bush,"Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him about August. [the French Ambassador has tuned out] When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan's new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment. [the assembly is overcome with silence] Question? [more silence. An ambassador raises his hand] Yes?"
3567,6,12,Another Ambassador,"Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?"
3568,6,12,George W. Bush,"I assure you, I am not high."
3569,6,12,Eric Cartman,You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! [Stan and Kyle rise and line up on either side of Cartman]
3570,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What do you mean, fatass?"
3571,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere."
3572,6,12,Stan Marsh,Where??
3573,6,12,Eric Cartman,"I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic [Kyle looks down at the lumber, then looks at the pile behind him] and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box. [Kyle fishes around for a small solid piece of lumber, then finds one and aims it at Cartman's head] I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken- [thunk] AY! [is dazed for a bit, then recovers none too pleased, then glares at Kyle]"
3574,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,Do you see anything?
3575,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! [starts at Kyle, but Stan holds him back]"
3576,6,12,Stan Marsh,Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
3577,6,12,Eric Cartman,Not by giving me brain damage!
3578,6,12,Stan Marsh,Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
3579,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[stares at Stan, then resigns to his former position] Alright, go ahead. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!... no. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!..."
3580,6,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!"
3581,6,12,Randy Marsh,What? [follows the ladies out with Gerald]
3582,6,12,Sharon Marsh,See for yourself!
3583,6,12,"Nobunaga Hiroichi, SNN Japanese Correspondent","This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben. [behind him is a set with clouds hanging from wires. Angels swing into place slowly] The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh. [one of the angels falls off her rope and hits the ground. The correspondent sees this and moves in front of her to block the shot. Someone enters the shot and plants a Japanese flag among the clouds] Therefore, hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu."
3584,6,12,Natsako Semu,"Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy."
3585,6,12,"Nobunaga Hiroichi, SNN Japanese Correspondent","[fairly gloating] That's the news from heben. [the set creaks behind him and falls down, showing the studio.] Dame! Dame da! Bakayarou da!! [""No good! It's no good! Idiots!""]"
3586,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven."
3587,6,12,Gerald Broflovski,Kids!
3588,6,12,George W. Bush,Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.
3589,6,12,Sharon Marsh,"Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?"
3590,6,12,Randy Marsh,"If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. [behind the crowd Cartman, Stan and Kyle return with buckets of candy. That conking finally worked]"
3591,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. [everyone turns to look at the boys]"
3592,6,12,Some Guy,Dude.
3593,6,12,George W. Bush,Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs.
3594,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home."
3595,6,12,Randy Marsh,"Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??"
3596,6,12,Eric Cartman,"...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before."
3597,6,12,Channel 4 Field Reporter,But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?
3598,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels..."
3599,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now."
3600,6,12,General,"So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!"
3601,6,12,Johnson,Sir!
3602,6,12,Randy Marsh,"No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it."
3603,6,12,Crowd,Awwww. [the crowd begins to disperse and people begin to cry in appreciation]
3604,6,12,George W. Bush,[moving off with his staff] And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs.
3605,6,12,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there? [walks up to the boys] You little bastards ruined my latest song! [drives his guitar into the snow, breaking it, then walks away]"
3606,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy."
3607,6,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
3608,6,12,Eric Cartman,"[chuckles] No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick! [looks stunned] ...Oh Jesus Christ."
3609,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa. [shakes Cartman around] Kenny, you in there?"
3610,6,12,Eric Cartman,"Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! [runs off]"
3611,6,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, come back here! [chases after Cartman]"
3612,6,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Stop him, Kenny! [follows them off. The camera suddenly pans up]"
3613,6,12,Saddam Hussein,Keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come on!
3614,6,12,God,"[a bright beam of light lands on Saddam, who shields his eyes] Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here."
3615,6,12,Saddam Hussein,"Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This is a chocolate chip factory. See? [displays boxes of ""Saddam's Heavenly Chocolate Chips""]"
3616,6,12,God,It looks like a chemical weapons plant.
3617,6,12,Saddam Hussein,"Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't make it look like a chemical weapons plant, would I? I'd make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something."
3618,6,12,God,"...Alright, just checking. [removes the beam of light]"
3619,6,12,Saddam Hussein,[giggles] Stupid asshole! [goes back to work]
3620,6,13,Stan Marsh,O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
3621,6,13,Eric Cartman,Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
3622,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!"
3623,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[entering] Uh, boys, [the boys look up] Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?"
3624,6,13,Stan Marsh,You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
3625,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, whatever."
3626,6,13,Eric Cartman,It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
3627,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?"
3628,6,13,Stan Marsh,"[reaches out and receives the tape] Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!"
3629,6,13,Stan Kyle Cartman,Ho! [they head out the front door. Randy moves away from the stairs and towards Sharon on the sofa]
3630,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[snuggles up to her] Hmmm, that gets rid of them."
3631,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?"
3632,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store. [holds up a VHS case] I also rented... a porno."
3633,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oho, you little devil."
3634,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[softly, sensually] You wanna go watch?"
3635,6,13,Stan Marsh,How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
3636,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[notices something and gasps] Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
3637,6,13,Eric Cartman,Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. [a car passes by and Cartman fires away at it with his staff]
3638,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Good job, wizard."
3639,6,13,Eric Cartman,"And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew."
3640,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm a Paladin, Cartman!"
3641,6,13,Eric Cartman,Jews can't be Paladins.
3642,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Hey there, cowboy."
3643,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[holds up the video and turns to Sharon] You ready for some hot, steamy fun?"
3644,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"[smiling, right index finger against her chin] You bet I am."
3645,6,13,Randy Marsh,"The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, ""this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made."" [puts the video into the player]"
3646,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"[now reclining on the bed, running her finger along the bedsheets] Mmm, sounds good."
3647,6,13,Randy Marsh,"I love that lingerie. [opens his nightgown to reveal a purple cod piece, then in a low voice] Yeah. You like that?"
3648,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Mm, yeah baby."
3649,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yeeaahhh. [reclines on the bed, facing her and holding the remote control] Alright, you ready?"
3650,6,13,Sharon Marsh,Ready.
3651,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Oh, yeah. [they turn to the TV. Randy starts the video]"
3652,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,"[the video begins. Randy massages Sharon's arm] The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar."
3653,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story."
3654,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.
3655,6,13,Randy Marsh,Oh yeah. [begins caressing Sharon]
3656,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,"Seven, to the races of Elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor. [Sharon takes a good look at the video]"
3657,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. [Randy takes a look]"
3658,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the-- [jumps up and sits on the bed, aghast] Oh, my God! [quickly rises and turns off the TV, gets the video out, and reads] This is Lord of the Rings!"
3659,6,13,Sharon Marsh,But then that mean..?
3660,6,13,Randy Marsh,The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
3661,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Oh, hello boys."
3662,6,13,Stan Marsh,My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
3663,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Well, thank you very much, kind heroes."
3664,6,13,Eric Cartman,Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
3665,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. [closes the door. The boys leave]"
3666,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Man, that's crap."
3667,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Butters, [Butters stands up] look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings."
3668,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[rushes up to meet his parents] Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!"
3669,6,13,Linda Stotch,"Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?"
3670,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!"
3671,6,13,Chris Stotch,"That's our man. Here you go. [hands the tape to Butters, who goes to the VCR and puts the tape in. The parents leave]"
3672,6,13,Butters Stotch,Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. [the video begins to play. A man and a woman are heard]
3673,6,13,Evan Stone,"[softly] Spank that ass. [a few seconds later, a spanking is heard]"
3674,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Whoa. [more sounds from the video] Neat-o. [more sounds, a few spankings] Well, this is good."
3675,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. ""Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back."" [buries her face in her right hand]"
3676,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet."
3677,6,13,Eric Cartman,And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
3678,6,13,Stan Marsh,The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. [a few seconds later some headlights shine on them]
3679,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
3680,6,13,Eric Cartman,Prepare for battle! [switch to the car]
3681,6,13,Sharon Marsh,The boys! [Randy drives up to the boys and stops. Both he and Sharon jump out and rush up to them]
3682,6,13,Randy Marsh,Boys! Boys! [stops] Where's the videotape?
3683,6,13,Stan Marsh,We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
3684,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now."
3685,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? [the boys look at each other]"
3686,6,13,Eric Cartman,This sounds like a really important quest.
3687,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home. [falling into a fantasy accent] Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded."
3688,6,13,Stan Marsh,Woww.
3689,6,13,Eric Cartman,This... is so cool.
3690,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns left] Gentlemen, we are off! [the boys turn back to walk to Butters' house. Randy watches them leave]"
3691,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[rises and looks at Sharon] Okay, problem solved."
3692,6,13,Woman,"...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm..."
3693,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh golly. [his legs part and he points to his crotch] Hey, what's happening down there? [the basement door is heard opening and closing. Butters is fascinated by his body's reaction. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come down the stairs. Cartman reaches for his crotch for tactile inspection]"
3694,6,13,Stan Marsh,We have come to reclaim the one tape! [Butters sits up and Kyle goes for the tape]
3695,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[walks up to Kyle] Wha-wha, what are you doing?! [Kyle removes it and puts it into the LotR case it came in]"
3696,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[walks off. Butters is saddened] The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
3697,6,13,Butters Stotch,"But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it."
3698,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. [the boys head up the stairs and out of the house. Butters opens the door and jumps at them]"
3699,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Bwaagghh! [falls on his face, then quickly gets up and retreats]"
3700,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
3701,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Well, then... then let me go with you."
3702,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. [Little does Kyle know what Butters' idea of LotR is. The boys turn to walk away]"
3703,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Wuh, okay. [Butters jumps on Kyle's left arm and starts making love to it] Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah."
3704,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[glares at Butters] Butters, what the hell are you doing?!"
3705,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[a bit surprised] Playing Lord of the Rings. [resumes the love-making] Ugh, wegh, oh yeah."
3706,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[smacks Butters with the tape, causing him to fall off] Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!"
3707,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[on hands and knees, with renewed determination] Let me have the tape!"
3708,6,13,Stan Marsh,"[takes the tape from Kyle] No, we have to return it! [the boys turn to walk away again. Butters crawls a few inches]"
3709,6,13,Butters Stotch,My movie! [sorrowfully reaches out for it with left hand] My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
3710,6,13,Eric Cartman,And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
3711,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
3712,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too."
3713,6,13,Eric Cartman,Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. [three older boys ride up on their bikes and stop before the group. It's the sixth graders]
3714,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"[gets off his bike and approaches the boys] Well, well, well! If it isn't Robin Hood and his Merry Men!"
3715,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, crap, the sixth graders!"
3716,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,Whatcha got there?
3717,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Nothing. [the sixth grader rips the tape out of Stan's hand] Hey, kid!"
3718,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,[looks at the case] Lord of the Rings? Ha! That movie's gay!
3719,6,13,Eric Cartman,You're gay!
3720,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"[opens the case and looks at the tape] What the--? [reads the title: ""Back Door Sluts 9"" XXX] Whoa! [backs up to show the tape to his friends] Check it out, you guys!"
3721,6,13,Sixth Graders 2 3,Whoa!
3722,6,13,Stan Marsh,Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
3723,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,[approaches menacingly with the tape. Stan backs up] No way! We're keepin' this and watchin' it ourselves!
3724,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,You can't keep it.
3725,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"And what are three little fourth graders gonna do about it, huh?!"
3726,6,13,Stan Marsh,There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
3727,6,13,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
3728,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Oh man, I can't wait to see this!"
3729,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[aside to Stan] Dude, that video is making people act strange."
3730,6,13,Eric Cartman,The one tape must be returned! [swats the tape out of the sixth grader's hands with the staff and watches as the tape falls into Stan's hands] Run! [the boys run away from the sixth graders]
3731,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,Get 'em! [his two friends ride off after the boys. He picks up his bike and joins his friends]
3732,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon."
3733,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?"
3734,6,13,Linda Stotch,"No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs."
3735,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, dear!"
3736,6,13,Chris Stotch,What's the matter?
3737,6,13,Randy Marsh,"We... [now nervous] Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. [Sharon shrugs, and both of them smile sheepishly]"
3738,6,13,Linda Stotch,Ohh Godd!! [the Stotches panic and rush downstairs. The Marshes follow]
3739,6,13,Chris Stotch,Butters?
3740,6,13,Linda Stotch,Butters? [they notice the television] Butters!
3741,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[peeks out from behind the sofa, in the shadow, then speaks in a raspy voice] The precious? [his parents turn to see him] Could you bring back my precious?"
3742,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Butters, where is the movie you were watching?"
3743,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[crawls out into view] They took his precious, took it away to watch without him. [sits up and puts his hands on his knees] He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious."
3744,6,13,Randy Marsh,The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
3745,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"[gravely] Oh, no. [Chris and Linda look back at them]"
3746,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
3747,6,13,Eric Cartman,"I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands."
3748,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"[nearby, off screen] I smell fourth graders!"
3749,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh crap, dude!"
3750,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hide! [they jump over the massive root and hide in the pocket underneath. The lead sixth grader comes into view and sniffs the air. He hops off and looks around over the root. The boys look up in apprehension. The sixth grader sniffs around above them]
3751,6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"[off screen] Hey. [the lead sixth grader whips around and goes to see who it is. It's his friend, in brown cap] I think I see something down the hill. [the lead sixth grader looks in that direction, then the sixth graders take off. The boys express relief after a few seconds]"
3752,6,13,Stan Marsh,Ogh. [Cartman sighs silently]
3753,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
3754,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders."
3755,6,13,Eric Cartman,"[rises and moves off] Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon."
3756,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. [the boys leave the root]"
3757,6,13,Randy Marsh,[debriefing Gerald and Sheila] And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
3758,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh God, this, this is horrible!"
3759,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?"
3760,6,13,Randy Marsh,I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. [he and Sharon hang their heads in shame]
3761,6,13,Gerald Chris,Backdoor Sluts 9?!?
3762,6,13,Linda Stotch,Is that bad?
3763,6,13,Chris Stotch,Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!
3764,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. [Sheila gets angrier by the word]"
3765,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,[slaps him] How the hell do you know?!
3766,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"[shakily] I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People."
3767,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"[now facing the Marshes] Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!"
3768,6,13,Sharon Marsh,We're sorry.
3769,6,13,Liane Cartman,"Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film."
3770,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
3771,6,13,Randy Marsh,"It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?"
3772,6,13,Butters Stotch,[pops up outside and taps on a window] Precious. [the adults turn to see the window] Let me see my precious. [slides down the window and out of view] Plee-ee-ee-ease! [the adults just look on]
3773,6,13,Eric Cartman,[waves his left hand around] Open. [nothing. He waves his left hand again] Bellog. [the door opens and Clyde appears]
3774,6,13,Clyde Donovan,What do you guys want?
3775,6,13,Stan Marsh,We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
3776,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Oh. Okay, hang on a second. [steps back and closes the door, then reopens the door. He is now dressed as an elf. His staff is a small hoe] What troubles you?"
3777,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,We have in our possession something of great power. [pulls out the videotape] It is... The Lord of the Rings.
3778,6,13,Clyde Donovan,So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
3779,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Yes, but this is not a-- [stops, then reacts] Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. [hands the tape to Clyde]"
3780,6,13,Eric Cartman,"We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape."
3781,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble."
3782,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, High Elf of Paragon."
3783,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Faragon, asshole! [closes the door. The boys leave the house and walk off]"
3784,6,13,Eric Cartman,Clyde's a dick.
3785,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Alright, everybody listen up! There's three snot-nosed little fourth graders out there who have a porno called Backdoor Sluts 9."
3786,6,13,Other Sixth Graders,Ooooooh!
3787,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"I checked it out on the Internet, and it said that Backdoor Sluts 9 is the most hard-core porno ever made."
3788,6,13,Other Sixth Graders,Ahhhhh!
3789,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"I have amassed this army of sixth graders to get the tape by any means necessary. Now, let's go get that porno! [the sixthh graders scream and charge out into the night on their bikes]"
3790,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? [Kyle gets up, walks to the table, and stands the tape on it]"
3791,6,13,Other boys,Ahhh.
3792,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
3793,6,13,Craig Tucker,It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
3794,6,13,Kevin,"[wearing a Star Wars Imperial stormtrooper helmet] Perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers. [the kids look at him. One shot has Tweek wearing a large coffee tin on his head, Pip dressed as an elf, a kindergartner wearing a Fett helmet, then one of Stan, Kyle and Cartman]"
3795,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Kevin, god-damnit..! [Kevin looks around, then hops off his chair and leaves]"
3796,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody."
3797,6,13,Stan Marsh,"But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too."
3798,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black."
3799,6,13,Token Black,"[thinks about this, then leaves his seat] I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape, [reaches the table and gets the tape] just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me. [walks towards the house] The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. [reaches the sliding door and enters the house, closing the door behnd him]"
3800,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,Fourth graders! Give us that porn-o! [they go out of view. A moment later the Marsh car comes into view]
3801,6,13,Sharon Marsh,Boys? [the Broflovskis are in the back seat]
3802,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"[with her head out the window] Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. [behind them is the Stotch car]"
3803,6,13,Eric Cartman,Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. [the other boys stir]
3804,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? [Token returns to the table and places the tape there]"
3805,6,13,Token Black,I'm not playing anymore. [walks off]
3806,6,13,Stan Marsh,"[steps forward] Uh, wellWait, what'd you see?"
3807,6,13,Token Black,"[stops and turns] I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. [claps his hands, then walks back into the house, sliding the door open and closed. The boys look on]"
3808,6,13,Eric Cartman,"My God, this thing must really be powerful. [the boys turn to look at the tape]"
3809,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
3810,6,13,Stan Marsh,What do we do with it?
3811,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came."
3812,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, where is the videotape rented from?"
3813,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[picks up the tape and looks for the store name] Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
3814,6,13,Tweek Tweak,Conifer? Walking there would take hours!
3815,6,13,Clyde Donovan,There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
3816,6,13,Kindergartner,I'll go.
3817,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. [all the boys begin to chatter, nominating who should return the video]"
3818,6,13,Craig Tucker,You're too young.
3819,6,13,Eric Cartman,Quiet!
3820,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"You guys, this is stupid."
3821,6,13,Eric Cartman,You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
3822,6,13,Stan Marsh,I will take it! [the boys quiet down and Stan approaches the table. He takes the tape in hand. Cartman closes his eyes in meditation] I will walk to the video store.
3823,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard [Cartman], the dwarf [the kindergartner], the warrior [Craig], the cleric [Jimmy], and the Jew [Kyle]."
3824,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[flashes anger] Paladin!
3825,6,13,Clyde Donovan,Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
3826,6,13,Tweek Tweak,Me too.
3827,6,13,Other boys,"[agreeing] Yeah, yeah, yeah."
3828,6,13,Craig Tucker,Only the six of us are to go?
3829,6,13,Stan Marsh,"No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?"
3830,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, stupid. [higher pitch] Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us. [a bit lower] Shut up, Kenny."
3831,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
3832,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
3833,6,13,Craig Tucker,Look out! [a small avalanche of snow appears in front of them]
3834,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[gasps a little] We were almost killed.
3835,6,13,Eric Cartman,A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
3836,6,13,Stan Marsh,True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
3837,6,13,Token s Father,Oh. Hello everybody.
3838,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago."
3839,6,13,Token s Mother,"Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter?"
3840,6,13,Randy Marsh,"We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape."
3841,6,13,Steve Williams and wife,What? But Token's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what toOh God! [rushes to look for Token]
3842,6,13,Token s Mother,Token! [the other parents rush in]
3843,6,13,Token s Mother,Token? Did the boys come over and... show you a movie? [no answer]
3844,6,13,Steve Williams and wife,"Token? [no answer, long pause] Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. [no response, long pause]"
3845,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[kneels next to Token] Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse. [no response, long pause] Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love."
3846,6,13,Token Black,"[no response, long pause] ...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too? [no response] Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?"
3847,6,13,Steve Williams and wife,"Jesus, what kind of porno is that?"
3848,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,It was Backdoor Sluts 9.
3849,6,13,Steve Williams and wife,"Oh, Jesus, not that one! [his wife gives him an angry look]"
3850,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid."
3851,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?"
3852,6,13,Craig Tucker,We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
3853,6,13,Stan Marsh,Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
3854,6,13,Kindergartner,Ringworms are no match for a dwarf.
3855,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure! [they pass a yard on which some kids are playing] For that is the way of the--"
3856,6,13,Boy 1,I shall put the magic spell on you!
3857,6,13,Boy 2,"I have blocked your spell, wizard!"
3858,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, what are you guys doing? [the Bailey kids turn and look]"
3859,6,13,Boy 3,We're playing Harry Potter.
3860,6,13,Eric Cartman,[after a few moments of thought] Ha!! Fags! [the boys move on. They soon pass a Country Café]
3861,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[suddenly wary] You guys. Somebody is following us.
3862,6,13,Eric Cartman,It's Butters.
3863,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Butters?
3864,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. [behind the six boys, at some distance, is Butters, skulking along in the shadows]"
3865,6,13,Butters Stotch,The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
3866,6,13,Eric Cartman,Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
3867,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?"
3868,6,13,Eric Cartman,"There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! [the sound of sixth graders is heard in the distance. The boys look around to find the direction of the sound. The sixth graders appear in the horizon behind them and ride in quickly, screaming all the while]"
3869,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,They are coming. [a shot of the sixth graders] You guys go on ahead.
3870,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, are you sure?"
3871,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Go! [the other five boys take off, leaving Jimmy to face the sixth graders alone. He turns and stares down the approaching throng] You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh... [the sixth graders draw closer] You shall not paah... [a shot of the young bikers, then a distance shot of Jimmy, then a shot of the young bikers, a shot of Jimmy, a shot of the young bikers, a quick shot of Jimmy, then the sixth graders as they reach Jimmy] You shall not pa--! [the sixth graders take shots at him as they pass by. He falls and gets up] You shall not paah--! [struck down again, rises, is struck down, rises...] You shall not puh-uh-uh-- [falls again. The last of the sixth graders passes by, and Jimmy stands up, all beat up, with tire tracks and bruises on his face and a black eye] You shall not pass. [falls down]"
3872,6,13,Stan Marsh,Jimmy didn't stop them!
3873,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
3874,6,13,Eric Cartman,Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
3875,6,13,Craig Tucker,What? That's stupid.
3876,6,13,Eric Cartman,"I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!"
3877,6,13,Craig Tucker,Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. [walks off]
3878,6,13,Kindergartner,Me too. [follows Craig]
3879,6,13,Eric Cartman,Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
3880,6,13,Stan Marsh,Just get across the river! They're coming! [the three remaining boys scramble across the river. The sixth graders arrive. Two of them stop their tires by performing wheelies and landing their bikes back on the road. The lead sixth grader rides up between them]
3881,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,What the hell is wrong with you guys?! Get the tape!
3882,6,13,Sixth Grader 4,"Dude, I don't wanna get wet."
3883,6,13,Sixth Grader 5,"Yeah, I don't really like the water."
3884,6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"Besides, if our bikes get wet, their chains'll rust."
3885,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Oh, god-damnit. Alright, come on. We'll find a bridge. [the bikers ride off]"
3886,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,The quest continued to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
3887,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river."
3888,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost."
3889,6,13,Eric Cartman,"We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are! [twitched] That's what ""lost"" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!"
3890,6,13,Stan Marsh,This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
3891,6,13,Butters Stotch,[crawls up to them] The Butters knowses.
3892,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Oh brother!
3893,6,13,Butters Stotch,The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
3894,6,13,Stan Marsh,Where?!
3895,6,13,Butters Stotch,"First, just let Butters sseee the precious."
3896,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before."
3897,6,13,Eric Cartman,If that was possible.
3898,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!"
3899,6,13,Butters Stotch,[puts up his arms to shield himself] Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters. [squats with his arms hanging over his knees] We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. [walks forward in a squatting manner]
3900,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!"
3901,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context."
3902,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Look! There's one of the boys now! [before them is Jimmy, fallen and asleep in the middle of the road. Randy steps on the brakes] Jimmy!"
3903,6,13,Randy Marsh,[the adults jump out of their cars and approach him] Jimmy! Jimmy! [Jimmy awakens and looks up] Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
3904,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
3905,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time."
3906,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,They took it back to the video s... the video s...
3907,6,13,Randy Marsh,The video sandwich?
3908,6,13,Chris Stotch,The video stockyard.
3909,6,13,Randy Marsh,"What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?"
3910,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"No, the video suh... the video s...tih..."
3911,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,Stinger?
3912,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?"
3913,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"N-n-no, you retards! The video s...tore!"
3914,6,13,Adults,The video store! [they go to their cars]
3915,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,Hurry! Hurry!
3916,6,13,Randy Marsh,"I know where it is! [they get in their cars and peel off. (""When did the Broflovski station wagon arrive?"") Jimmy is left where he was when they arrived]"
3917,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! They're closed!
3918,6,13,Stan Marsh,Closed?
3919,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,[off screen] There they are!
3920,6,13,Sixth Grader 6,[the throng of sixth graders approach] Don't let them turn it back into the video store!
3921,6,13,Eric Cartman,We're screwed.
3922,6,13,Stan Marsh,"[seeing a way out of this mess] Wait. A drop box. [goes to it and pulls down the door] Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!"
3923,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Finally. [he and Cartman move towards the box. Butters looks on] It's over.
3924,6,13,Butters Stotch,[now moving] Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! [jumps on Kyle and runs off with the tape]
3925,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! No!
3926,6,13,Butters Stotch,[now in the middle of the parking lot] Now wees hases it! [the sixth graders close in]
3927,6,13,Stan Marsh,They're coming!
3928,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[goes after Butters and tries to wrest the tape from him] It has to go back!
3929,6,13,Butters Stotch,It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
3930,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"[a foot away] There it is! Give me that tape! [Butters holds on tight to the tape, smiling wide.]"
3931,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[picks Butters up and carries him off] Let go of the tape, Butters!"
3932,6,13,Butters Stotch,I'll never let go! [Stan opens the drop box and holds the door open]
3933,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Fine! [tosses him into the drop box]
3934,6,13,Butters Stotch,Precious! [Stan closes the door. The lead sixth grader leaps off his bike and rushes to the drop box]
3935,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Nooo! [reaches in and fishes around for it] No, nooo! [walks off in disgust and hits the window] Damnit! [the other sixth graders arrive]"
3936,6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"Aw man, now we'll never see the hot action."
3937,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,You stupid little fourth graders!
3938,6,13,Eric Cartman,The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
3939,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Middle-earth is again safe.
3940,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Yeah? Well, that's not gonna stop us from kicking your asses!"
3941,6,13,Stan Marsh,Uh-oh.
3942,6,13,Randy Marsh,Boys! Boys!
3943,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Crap! Parents! [gets on his bike and turns away] Come on, guys. [the sixth graders leave] We'll see you next time, fourthies!"
3944,6,13,Eric Cartman,And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
3945,6,13,Randy Marsh,There you are!
3946,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, Kyle! You're safe!"
3947,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video."
3948,6,13,Randy Marsh,"A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths. [the boys are stunned] Uh, this is called ""69ing"" and it's normal."
3949,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it."
3950,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle."
3951,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice."
3952,6,13,Randy Marsh,That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
3953,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
3954,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it."
3955,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, boys. Do you have any questions? [the boys are still stunned, but one of them finally speaks]"
3956,6,13,Stan Marsh,...Wow. [another long moment of stunned silence]
3957,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Well, let's all get going."
3958,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. [the adults head for their cars, but the boys stay frozen in place]"
3959,6,13,Chris Stotch,[turns around. Linda does as well] Wait a minute. Where's Butters?
3960,6,13,Butters Stotch,[rises from the batch of videotapes that buried him] Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
3961,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[enters with Mr. Hat on his hand] You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?"
3962,6,14,Principal Victoria,"Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat. [Mr. Garrison takes a seat] Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade."
3963,6,14,Mr Garrison,[flatly] I'm aware of that.
3964,6,14,Principal Victoria,"I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you."
3965,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Wow, that's... really great to hear."
3966,6,14,Principal Victoria,"As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job."
3967,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[brightens] Oh, for real? You're not kidding?"
3968,6,14,Principal Victoria,"We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that."
3969,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[rises from the chair with excitement] Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true! [shakes her hand] Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!"
3970,6,14,Principal Victoria,I know you will. [Garrison turns around and walks away smiling]
3971,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[turns around] You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow."
3972,6,14,Principal Victoria,"[slight chuckle] It's for real, Mr. Garrison."
3973,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[slight chuckle, turns around and walks out the door] Oh-ho, great!"
3974,6,14,Principal Victoria,With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
3975,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Right uh- [stops in his tracks at the door's entrance, his smile turns to wonder. He turns around] Wha- ...what was that?"
3976,6,14,Principal Victoria,"Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money."
3977,6,14,Mr Garrison,"...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?"
3978,6,14,Principal Victoria,"[busy doing paperwork] Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think."
3979,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Yeh-you don't say. [strokes his chin] Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria. [walks out and closes the door] Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!"
3980,6,14,Mr Mackey,"M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. [the kids erupt in laughter]"
3981,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,Funny.
3982,6,14,Mr Mackey,"BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison. [the door opens and Garrison enters]"
3983,6,14,Kids,AWWWW!!!
3984,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,Not him!
3985,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey."
3986,6,14,Mr Mackey,"[walks toward the door] Good luck, m'kay."
3987,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is [writes on the board] Mr. Garrison."
3988,6,14,Butters Stotch,"Where is Mr. Hat, sir?"
3989,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat."
3990,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,[rolls his eyes] Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
3991,6,14,Mr Garrison,"But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to... [the door opens again] Mr. Slave. [a strapping man enters. He wears a pink shirt, pale blue jeans; black leather vest, chaps and boots; police hat, strong jaw and mustache, and pouty lips]"
3992,6,14,Mr Slave,[preens] Hi kids. Hm.
3993,6,14,Mr Garrison,"So that's [writes on the board] Mr. Slave. [Mr. Slave poses] The teacher's assistant. [Mr Slave smooths his mustache, then his hat] Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass."
3994,6,14,Mr Slave,[throws his arms forward] Oh Jesus Christ.
3995,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. [Mr. Slave goes to sit down. Garrison spanks him as he passes by]"
3996,6,14,Mr Slave,Ugh.
3997,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[leans towards Craig, who pays attention] Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a... [glances back] Pakistani."
3998,6,14,Mr Garrison,"I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard. [does motions for both words - the palms facing each other and pulling apart, then two fists] Really long and really hard. [emphasizes the motions]"
3999,6,14,Mr Slave,[at a small teacher's desk reading a magazine] Oh Jesus Christ.
4000,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[gleefully] Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. [erases the name on the board and begins writing the topic, starting with an S]"
4001,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[begins making a paper plane involuntarily] No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?"
4002,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[finishes writing ""STALIN""] Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to..."
4003,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[finishes the plane and aims it at Mr. Garrison] Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! [fires the plane off. It hits the board and falls away]"
4004,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[turns around and points] Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!"
4005,6,14,Eric Cartman,"No, it was Kenny!"
4006,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[arms akimbo] Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!"
4007,6,14,Stan Marsh,"[coming to Cartman's defense] Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body."
4008,6,14,The Other Kids,Yeah.
4009,6,14,Mr Garrison,"That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment! [reaches into his desk and pulls out a paddle, then strikes it against his left palm twice. He walks over to Mr. Slave and has him bend over] Take it Mr. Slave! [swats him three times on the ass]"
4010,6,14,Mr Slave,[moves his head around] Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.
4011,6,14,Mr Garrison,"I will [swat] NOT put up with [swat] TOM foolery in my [swat] CLASS room, children. [stands him up and straps a gag ball around Mr. Slave's face] Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth. [bends Mr. Slave over his lap and swats him some more] Take that, Slavey! take it! [the kids look on, stunned. Mr. Garrison continues the swats] This'll get me fired for sure. [smiles]"
4012,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
4013,6,14,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America."
4014,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. [Sharon sips some coffee, a door opens]"
4015,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,So full of metaphor.
4016,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey guys, can we talk to you? [with him are Stan, Cartman, Butters, and Tweek]"
4017,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, hi boys."
4018,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,How was school?
4019,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Uhh, not cool."
4020,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?"
4021,6,14,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? [a burst of chatter follows]"
4022,6,14,Stan Marsh,"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher."
4023,6,14,Chris,Uh huh.
4024,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay."
4025,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
4026,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay."
4027,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"[displeased] Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were."
4028,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but Dad-"
4029,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!"
4030,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! [Gerald crosses his arms. The kids look at each other]
4031,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,[a woman greeting the families inside the museum] Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America. [Cartman yawns loudly. Liane smacks him across the back of his head]
4032,6,14,Eric Cartman,Ey!
4033,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"[leads them through the museum] Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance? [leads the group to a tunnel entrance] Let's begin our tour with a walk through our Tunnel of Prejudice, to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against. [motions for the boys to enter, and the boys enter]"
4034,6,14,Voice,"[the words it says appear on the walls of the tunnel as it says them, then disappear] QUEER. BEANER. CHINK. NIGGER. HEEB. FAGGOT. CRACKER. SLOPE. [the boys are suitably shocked as they move along the tunnel's people mover, but Cartman is grinning from ear to ear]"
4035,6,14,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, this is awesome! [""JAP""]"
4036,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,[at the other end of the tunnel with the parents] Now you know how it feels.
4037,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[excited, runs up to the guide] I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!"
4038,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"[leads them into the Hall of Stereotypes] We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities. [leads them to the first exhibit] Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? [the stereotypes are exhibits, each one with its own spotlight]"
4039,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"[walks up to another exhibit with Stan and Kyle] Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. [the Arab is holding a Kalashnikov rifle]"
4040,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?"
4041,6,14,Butters Stotch,[sees a third exhibit] W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. [walks over to it. The others follow]
4042,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like ""All Asians are good at math"" is harmful to society."
4043,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[over at a fourth exhibit, a man cowering over a bag of money] Look, a covetous Jew!"
4044,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"[arrives with the others] Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed."
4045,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"[notices a fifth spotlight and walks to it] Ah, here's a good one. [Stan walks up next to him] It's the stereotypical ""sleepy Mexican."" [a man sleeps under the spotlight sitting up next to a mop and bucket]"
4046,6,14,Janitor,"[wakes up] Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it? [stands up and rubs the back of his neck]"
4047,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,[in a low voice] Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
4048,6,14,Janitor,"Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy. [walks off with the mop and bucket]"
4049,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"[leads them into the Tolerance Discovery Lab] This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays [they measure tolerance I.Q.], because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight, [moves her arms towards Cartman] like this young man here."
4050,6,14,Eric Cartman,Ey!
4051,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"You other boys have probably called this young man names like ""tubby,"" or ""lardbutt,"" or ""fat tits,""..."
4052,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"""Fat tits."" That's a good one."
4053,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I have to remember that."
4054,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice."
4055,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[strokes his chin and tries something out] I'm not fat, I have a different life choice."
4056,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
4057,6,14,Eric Cartman,"Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! [the adults chuckle]"
4058,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,That's our Cartman. [Cartman grins]
4059,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"Well, that's the end of our tour."
4060,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?"
4061,6,14,Stan Marsh,I guess.
4062,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do. [notices someone nearby] Hey! What the hell are you doing? [it's a man smoking on the edge of the fountain]
4063,6,14,Smoker,Oh I was just uh-
4064,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,There's no smoking in the museum!
4065,6,14,Smoker,But I'm not in the museum.
4066,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"Get out of here, you filthy smoker! [the smoker rises and walks off]"
4067,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah, dirty lungs!"
4068,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!"
4069,6,14,Chris,Dumbass!
4070,6,14,Richard and Mrs. Tweek,Get out of here! [the smoker walks out of view]
4071,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"Well, have a great day, everybody."
4072,6,14,Chris,Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
4073,6,14,The Boys,Yeah.
4074,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today. [sits on a corner of the desk] Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?"
4075,6,14,Butters Stotch,It evaporates.
4076,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react. [takes the tube in hand and walks over to Mr. Slave] Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please. [Mr. Slave looks up from his magazine, then assumes the position over his little desk and lowers his pants enough to show his ass] Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass. [steps backwards and inserts the tube. Mr. Slave starts to moan] The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy"
4077,6,14,Mr Slave,AAH.
4078,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?"
4079,6,14,Butters Stotch,Sure. [smiles and goes to get Lemmiwinks]
4080,6,14,Stan Marsh,"[sensing what's about to happen] Oh, no, no, no no no no."
4081,6,14,Mr Garrison,[gets Lemmiwinks from Butters] Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass? [the kids are all aghast] Well let's see. [lifts up the Bunsen tube and sends the gerbil on its way down]
4082,6,14,Mr Slave,"AAH. [the gerbil enters Mr. Slave's lower intestine and comes across the skeleton of another gerbil. It turns back immediately and runs for the anal opening. Mr. Garrison pulls the tube out and the sphincter snaps shut, trapping the gerbil inside. It tries to claw its way out] AAH. [moves his head around] Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!"
4083,6,14,Butters Stotch,[realizing what just happened] Lemmiwinks? NO!
4084,6,14,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
4085,6,14,The Boys,Hey Chef.
4086,6,14,Chef,How's it goin'?
4087,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,Bad.
4088,6,14,Chef,Why bad?
4089,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we're intolerant. [beat]"
4090,6,14,Chef,...Intolerant of who?
4091,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Gays, I guess."
4092,6,14,Chef,"Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children? [arms akimbo] I thought you knew better."
4093,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him."
4094,6,14,Chef,"Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, ""What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"""
4095,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass."
4096,6,14,Chef,"Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!"
4097,6,14,Stan Marsh,Are we homophobes now?
4098,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef."
4099,6,14,Chef,"Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??"
4100,6,14,Stan Marsh,N-no?
4101,6,14,Chef,You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
4102,6,14,Eric Cartman,"I'll take three lunches today, please."
4103,6,14,Chef,"You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!"
4104,6,14,Eric Cartman,"It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. [Chef is puzzled]"
4105,6,14,Mr Garrison,"That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave. [laughs] Now we'll get fired for sure!"
4106,6,14,Mr Slave,[nonchalantly] Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.
4107,6,14,Principal Victoria,"[over the P.A. system] Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please?"
4108,6,14,Mr Garrison,That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. [shimmies out the door]
4109,6,14,Mr Slave,"Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh! [feels the gerbil try again to claw its way out of his ass] Oooooh, Jesus Christ. [scratches his ass. The gerbil runs one way, then back to the sphincter. A specter appears and stops the gerbil in its tracks. It's a Frog King. The two stand motionless for a few seconds]"
4110,6,14,Frog King,"Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die. [the gerbil just stands there] This way has been closed off by the Great Sphincter. To escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach. [the gerbil says nothing] Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words, Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then. [disappears. The gerbil turns around, scratches its chin, and begins its journey]"
4111,6,14,Singer,"A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward, Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead.
The journey before you may be long and filled with woe
But you must escape the gay man's ass so your tale can be told.
Lemmiwinks. Lehehemiwinks Lemmiwinks Lemmiwinks-"
4112,6,14,Mr Garrison,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?"
4113,6,14,Principal Victoria,"Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat"
4114,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[nudges Chef] Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired. [hums some more and takes a seat]"
4115,6,14,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods."
4116,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[in anticipation, gets melodramatic] Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go."
4117,6,14,Principal Victoria,No no no we're not firing you.
4118,6,14,Mr Garrison,...You're not?
4119,6,14,Principal Victoria,"No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar."
4120,6,14,Chef,[steps forward] Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!
4121,6,14,Principal Victoria,"You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words ""sick queer"" to describe his conduct in class?"
4122,6,14,Chef,He IS a sick queer!!
4123,6,14,Mr Garrison,Yeah!
4124,6,14,Principal Victoria,"I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef."
4125,6,14,Chef,Kiss my black ass!! [Mr. Garrison is surprised]
4126,6,14,Mr Mackey,"Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?"
4127,6,14,Stan Marsh,We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
4128,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Well I really thought you boys learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!"
4129,6,14,Butters Stotch,[still distraught] But they killed Lemmiwinks!
4130,6,14,Chris,"Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!"
4131,6,14,Butters Stotch,Yes sir.
4132,6,14,Chris,"Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn."
4133,6,14,Mr Mackey,"Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?"
4134,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,That sounds good to me.
4135,6,14,Liane Cartman,Mee too.
4136,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp."
4137,6,14,Stan Marsh,Tolerance camp?
4138,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,"[sternly] Welcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people's differences. [a shot of the kids shows that Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters were not the only kids to refuse attending Garrison's class] Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated."
4139,6,14,Mr Garrison,God-damnit!
4140,6,14,Mr Slave,How'd it go?
4141,6,14,Mr Garrison,"This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!"
4142,6,14,Mr Slave,The principal didn't fire you?
4143,6,14,Mr Garrison,No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
4144,6,14,Mr Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ."
4145,6,14,Mr Garrison,"I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!"
4146,6,14,Mr Slave,Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.
4147,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Oh well- [stops and thinks] Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave. [paces a bit] The parents have to see for themselves. [snaps his fingers] The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!"
4148,6,14,Mr Slave,"Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ. [rubs his belly, and the camera zooms in, cutting to the intestine. Lemmiwinks walks along, and a guitar is heard]"
4149,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"Lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far and fast.
To find his way out of a gay man's ass.
The road ahead is filled with danger and fright
But push onward, Lemmiwinks, with all of your might."
4150,6,14,Frog King,"[appears again before Lemmiwinks] Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance of the small intestine. Now you must seek out the Sparrow Prince. [disappears. Lemmiwinks walks up the large intestine, going back and forth. Eventually it sees the Sparrow Prince and stops]"
4151,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"The Sparrow Prince lies somewhere way up ahead.
Don't look back, Lemmiwinks, or you'll soon be dead.
Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, the time is growing late
Slow down now and seal your fate."
4152,6,14,Sparrow Prince,"I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my spirit been trapped within this place. Before you lies the maze of the small intestine. One path leads to the stomach, the other to certain doom. Take with you this helmet and torch. [they appear and float toward Lemmiwinks] Let them be your guide. [Lemmiwinks puts it on and continues its journey]"
4153,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"Take the magic helmet torch to help you light the way.
There's still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay.
Ahead of you lies adventure, and your strength still lies within.
Freedom from the Ass of Doom is the treasure you will win."
4154,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint! [the kids get busy fingerpainting] You vill not make any distinction between people of different colors! People with different sexual preferences! You vill accept everyone! [stops behind Kyle's right shoulder and swoops down to look at his paper] What are you fingerpainting?!
4155,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, a bear?"
4156,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!
4157,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[trembling in fear] Eh I, I don't know what else to paint."
4158,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,[takes Kyle's paper and rips it up] Start over! [puts his hand on the stack of papers next to Kyle] You will fingerpaint what we tell you! [takes a sheet from the stack and slams it down in front of Kyle] GO! [Kyle starts on a new picture] Faster. [the guard switches to the left shoulder without breaking his stare] Faster! [switches back to the right shoulder and cocks a pistol against Kyle's head] Faasterr.
4159,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,Aaaa! [hurries to finish the painting]
4160,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Faster! Are you done?! What is it?! What have you done?! [Kyle adds some broad strokes and lifts up the finished work]
4161,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,[trembling] People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
4162,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,"GOOD! [snatches the paper from Kyle's hand] That wasn't so hard, was it? [rips it up and tosses it away] NOW DO IT AGAIN! [walks off slowly] Faster! [the kids work faster] Faasterr!"
4163,6,14,Mr Garrison,"There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?"
4164,6,14,Mr Slave,"[scribbling on a notepad] Almost. I just have to get through a su- [grabs his stomach] Uh-huc, Jesus Christ."
4165,6,14,Mr Garrison,What's the matter?
4166,6,14,Mr Slave,"Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess."
4167,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. [hands Mr. Slave a glass of water and a pill]"
4168,6,14,Mr Slave,"Eugh, Jesus Christ. [takes the pill and swallows it. The camera follows the pill down the esophagus toward the stomach. The pill lands in the pool of acid in the stomach. Lemmiwinks pops up from the pool]"
4169,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"Lemmiwinks came to the stomach far.
 'Neath the depths of the lungs and heart."
4170,6,14,A Catfish,"You chose your path wisely, Lemmiwinks. I am the Catatafish."
4171,6,14,Singers (voiceover),Catatafish of the stomach's cove.
4172,6,14,Catatafish,"If you answer this riddle, the esophagus will let you pass."
4173,6,14,Singers (voiceover),Catatafish riddle will soom be told.
4174,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Everything in order?
4175,6,14,Camp Soldier,"Yes, mein Führer. Ve are making the prisoners make macaroni pictures that illustrate diversity in the verkplace."
4176,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,"[looks at a paper with two people shaking hands and with ""DIVERSITY"" written above them] Eh-xcellent! [down below the kids continue with their pictures.]"
4177,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,[Suddenly falls on his face] Oh.
4178,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. [helps him up and tries to rouse him] Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures."
4179,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,[limply] Can't... glue... any... more. [falls on his face again]
4180,6,14,Stan Marsh,"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!"
4181,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Take this one away. He is done for. [a soldier drags a boys body along the floor]
4182,6,14,Stan Marsh,Butters!
4183,6,14,Butters Stotch,No more... arts and crafts...
4184,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Jesus... we have to get out of here. [other kids are passed out, some on their backs, some on their stomachs]"
4185,6,14,Girl 1,Please don't tell them that we're hiding here.
4186,6,14,Girl 2,We can't work anymore. We'll die.
4187,6,14,Camp Soldier,[walking by] Vhat? [closes the door and turns around] Waht?!
4188,6,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work."
4189,6,14,Camp Soldier,Vhat is in there?
4190,6,14,Eric Cartman,Nothing.
4191,6,14,Camp Soldier,Get back to verk.
4192,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[salutes] Yes sir! [the guard walks away] Phew. [opens the door and steps inside, laughing. A few moments later he craps and starts laughing]"
4193,6,14,The Girls,Eww! Eww! Eww! [Cartman craps and laughs some more]
4194,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[exits and alerts any available soldier] Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! [goes to find a soldier]"
4195,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award. [applause] Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students.
4196,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son."
4197,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison. [applause. She moves off as Garrison enters riding on Mr. Slave, humming a song. Mr. Garrison wears a towering headdress while Mr. Slave is dressed as a horse. Mr. Slave stops]"
4198,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Get along, little Slave."
4199,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,Oh my God.
4200,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,That's what our boys were talking about?
4201,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[rings some small bells] Ding-ding, ding-ding."
4202,6,14,Man 1,[sitting next to Principal Victoria] He is so courageous.
4203,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[now at the podium, with Mr. Slave standing to his right. He's wearing a purple belt with shiny purple dildo hanging from it] Say, Mr. Slave."
4204,6,14,Mr Slave,"Yes, Mr. Garrison?"
4205,6,14,Mr Garrison,I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.
4206,6,14,Mr Slave,Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?
4207,6,14,Mr Garrison,"No no, I was the asshole. [a moment of silence, and more applause]"
4208,6,14,Man 2,"[brown hair and mustache] Ogh, that is so courageous."
4209,6,14,Man 3,[gray hair] What an amazing human being! [Randy and Gerald look at each other in shock]
4210,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls."
4211,6,14,Audience,Ahh [applause]
4212,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[frustrated, to Mr. Slave] It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave."
4213,6,14,Mr Slave,"I've got a little- Oof. [grabs his stomach] Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?"
4214,6,14,Frog King,"Hang on, Lemmiwinks! You solved the Catatafish's riddle. Now your trials are nearly through!"
4215,6,14,Mr Slave,"Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass! [a few moments of thought, and then more applause]"
4216,6,14,Mr Garrison,Uh...
4217,6,14,Man 4,[black hair] Courageous.
4218,6,14,Man 5,"[behind him, brown hair] So courageous."
4219,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[frustrated and finally letting loose] God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! [the applause dies down]"
4220,6,14,Man 3,"[softly] Oh, that's courageous."
4221,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!"
4222,6,14,Mr Slave,"Yeah, Jesus Christ."
4223,6,14,Man 6,But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant
4224,6,14,Man 3,[stands up and raises his arms] Yes. The mu-se-um.
4225,6,14,Man 7,[stands up and raises his arms] The mu-se-um tells us.
4226,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance! [the audience looks on] ""Tolerate"" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!"
4227,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting."
4228,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,We'ge gotta get our boys back! [gets up and rushes out]
4229,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[relieved] Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!"
4230,6,14,Principal Victoria,"No, no, I think I have a better idea."
4231,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?"
4232,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. [a close-up of the boys shows that Butters is the thinnest of them]
4233,6,14,Chris,"Come on, let's go. [the boys and their parents head away from the gate. As they go, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave are brought in by Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey. Two soldiers have them under gunpoint]"
4234,6,14,Mr Garrison,But this is insane!
4235,6,14,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior."
4236,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,"[arrives] Vhat do we have here? Noo recruits? I assure you, the next veek will be nothing but pain and suffering! [pounds his right fist into his left palm]"
4237,6,14,Mr Slave,"Oooo, this could be kind of fun. [convulses all of a sudden, goes down on hands and knees, and coughs up the gerbil]"
4238,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"Lemmiwinks has made it out and his tale is nearly through
[the three spirits he met in Mr. Slave's body now appear before him]"
4239,6,14,Catatafish,"Great job, Lemmiwinks."
4240,6,14,Sparrow Prince,Thanks to you we are all free.
4241,6,14,Frog King,"[draws close to Lemmiwinks] But your adventures are just beginning, for you are no ordinary gerbil, Lemmiwinks. You are the Gerbil King. [places a crown on its head, then backs up to join the other two animal spirits]"
4242,6,14,The Three Spirits,All hail the Gerbil King. [they disappear]
4243,6,15,Liane Cartman,[steps out of the ambulance] Be careful with my baby.
4244,6,15,Blonde Nurse,What have we got?
4245,6,15,Paramedic 1,[black hair] Not sure. It looks like a possible code five six!
4246,6,15,Eric Cartman,[disoriented] Kenny. Can't have Kenny.
4247,6,15,Liane Cartman,"[now helping the nurse and paramedics] You're going to be okay, baby."
4248,6,15,Dr Doctor,"[enters ready for surgery] Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too."
4249,6,15,Liane Cartman,Is he going to be okay?
4250,6,15,Brunette Nurse,"Let the doctor do his work, ma'am. [closes the curtain]"
4251,6,15,Liane Cartman,Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
4252,6,15,Dr Doctor,I'm afraid he's... running out of time.
4253,6,15,Liane Cartman,"[thinks a moment, then] Why?? What's wrong with him??"
4254,6,15,Dr Doctor,It's his time. It's ...running out.
4255,6,15,Liane Cartman,"Well, what does he need?"
4256,6,15,Dr Doctor,He needs to have more time.
4257,6,15,Liane Cartman,What can we do?
4258,6,15,Dr Doctor,"Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist. [turns and walks out. Liane returns to Cartman]"
4259,6,15,Liane Cartman,"[cradles Cartman somewhat] It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time."
4260,6,15,Eric Cartman,"Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!"
4261,6,15,Chef,"Hello there, children."
4262,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die."
4263,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care."
4264,6,15,Chef,Well what's wrong with him?
4265,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago."
4266,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix."
4267,6,15,Chef,"Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?"
4268,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?"
4269,6,15,Chef,"Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!"
4270,6,15,Liane Cartman,He's looking a little better today.
4271,6,15,Dr Doctor,"Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something. [the door opens and Chef, Stan and Kyle enter]"
4272,6,15,Eric Cartman,[cheerfully] Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
4273,6,15,Chef,Cartman?
4274,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No, that's Kenny."
4275,6,15,Eric Cartman,[surly] What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
4276,6,15,Stan Marsh,That's Cartman.
4277,6,15,Chef,"[approaches and has a look] Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?"
4278,6,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh, about a month."
4279,6,15,Dr Doctor,Let's not validate his delusions.
4280,6,15,Chef,"Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?"
4281,6,15,Eric Cartman,He's gone again.
4282,6,15,Chef,"Ms. Cartman, we need to get Cartman to a meeting room to speak with people who have crossed over."
4283,6,15,Dr Doctor,What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!
4284,6,15,Chef,This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
4285,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives."
4286,6,15,Chef,That's right. We have to go see him in New York.
4287,6,15,Dr Doctor,"I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored."
4288,6,15,Liane Cartman,"Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life! [switches mind gears] Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there."
4289,6,15,Chef,Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
4290,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,We're gong to New York?
4291,6,15,Flight Attendant,Welcome aboard Flight 673 to New York. We are happy to show you a feature film during the flight. In a moment we'll be showing a preview.
4292,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,[the boys begin to put on headphones] Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
4293,6,15,Stan Marsh,Awesome!
4294,6,15,Announcer,"Rob Shneider was an animal. [a shot of him on all fours running through the forest] Then he was a woman. [Rob steps out of a shower and inspects his new breasts. He's shocked] And now Rob Schneider is... [a shot of him sitting on a desk dressed as a stapler, stapling papers together] a stapler. [he's showing being a stapler in front of some cheering frat boys from Gamma Gamma Delta] And he's about to find out... [he's shown trying to catch a bus as a stapler] that being a stapler [he's shown with a woman, still as a stapler. He tries to get close to her, but falls off the sofa] is harder than it looks. Rob Schneider is... The Stapler. [title graphics show up] Rated PG-13"
4295,6,15,Stan Marsh,[remove their headphones]Weak!
4296,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,[remove their headphones]Weak!
4297,6,15,Eric Cartman,"[giggles] Ha-heheheh. [the boys look at him; he takes his headphones off and looks at them] That was Kenny laughing, not me."
4298,6,15,Chef,This must be the place.
4299,6,15,John Edward Show Page,"Okay audience members, hi, welcome to the taping of the show. [she collects tickets from members as they enter the studio] It's all general seating in there, and just remember, Mr. Edward might not hear from the particular dead person you wanna talk to, so just... keep an open mind."
4300,6,15,Chef,"Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you."
4301,6,15,Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward. [applause. John enters the set and steps on stage]"
4302,6,15,John Edward,"Thank you, thank you. Alright let's get started. [meditates a minute, then points to his right] 'S coming from over here. 'S the name Mike mean anything to anybody? [no reaction] I'm getting um, I'm getting M-mike? Definitely an M, d'um, maybe Matt? Mike? Matt? Mi-mmm, Mi-Mike, m-Mary?"
4303,6,15,Man 1,Mary was my mother!
4304,6,15,John Edward,"Okay okay, and she-she's she died?"
4305,6,15,Man 1,[begins to sob. A woman comforts him] Yes. Yeh-yes she did.
4306,6,15,John Edward,"Okay, and she's telling me there's something about... the money. That the, the money is safe? Is that making sense? [the man and woman look up]"
4307,6,15,Man 1,M-mm-m. Not really.
4308,6,15,John Edward,"Must be from somewhere else in the audience, then. Uh, d'uh, money? Is someone el-"
4309,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Uh, over here please?"
4310,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,We have a dead friend.

4313,6,15,John Edward,Kenny says hi.
4314,6,15,Audience members,Wow! [applause] wow...
4315,6,15,John Edward,"Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died?"
4316,6,15,Stan Marsh,We told you that.
4317,6,15,John Edward,"And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a sad death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?"
4318,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,Yee-yeah.
4319,6,15,Audience members,"[applause] Oh, wow, that's incredible! Wow!"
4320,6,15,Chef,"Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?"
4321,6,15,John Edward,"[blocking] Doesn't work that way. [turns his attention to the boys] Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place."
4322,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body."
4323,6,15,John Edward,"Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?"
4324,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,I'm Kyle.
4325,6,15,John Edward,"Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?"
4326,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,[responding] Yeah. My Grandma. [looks around] She's here?
4327,6,15,John Edward,"She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves."
4328,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God!
4329,6,15,John Edward,Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-?
4330,6,15,Woman 1,My Harry died last year!
4331,6,15,John Edward,"Oh, it's comin' from over here. [moves to the woman's side of the audience] I'm getting all kinds of voices today. [does a small skip] Woo! [laughter]"
4332,6,15,Stan Marsh,Heh hey wait a minute dude.
4333,6,15,John Edward,"Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things."
4334,6,15,Woman 1,[sobs and nods vigorously] Mmm-hmm.
4335,6,15,John Edward,And that those things involved... stuff?
4336,6,15,Woman 1,"The things did involve stuff, yes. [cries. The audience is awed and gets somewhat boisterous]"
4337,6,15,Chef,"Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!"
4338,6,15,Stan Marsh,He seemed better on TV?
4339,6,15,Chef,Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
4340,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,[exits the studio a bit panicked.] Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
4341,6,15,Stan Marsh,"[approaches Kyle] Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? [Cartman has a seizure; the other boys look over. Cartman goes silent, and he's shown standing unconscious.]"
4342,6,15,Liane Cartman,Eric? [the others draw closer] It must be his time. I think it's running out!
4343,6,15,Chef,We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.
4344,6,15,Chef,"[walks to Stan and Kyle and gives them their tickets] Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver."
4345,6,15,Stan Marsh,We don't get to go to Scotland?
4346,6,15,Liane Cartman,It's too far and your parents want you back home.
4347,6,15,Stan Marsh,"[to Cartman] Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso."
4348,6,15,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, asshole."
4349,6,15,Chef,"Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now."
4350,6,15,Announcer,This is the final boarding announcement for Flight 342 to Denver.
4351,6,15,Stan Marsh,[moving off slowly] That's us. Come on.
4352,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,Four white birds!
4353,6,15,Stan Marsh,Huh?
4354,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,"There's four white birds! [Sees a sign for Jewleeard, a private school for young Jews. The sign has four birds in flight above a small school, two stars of David flanking the building, and two traditional Jewish men in overcoats, one at each end of the sign. A phone number is shown underneath. Kyle and Stan walk closer to the sign] This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard."
4355,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually."
4356,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
4357,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. [walks off]"
4358,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not going back.
4359,6,15,Stan Marsh,"[stops and looks at Kyle, astonished] What??"
4360,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud! [drops his ticket on the ground] Tell my parents I'll call them. [hurries away]
4361,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! [slaps his left palm on his face]"
4362,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please."
4363,6,15,John Edward's Butler,He doesn't do private readings.
4364,6,15,Stan Marsh,"I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick."
4365,6,15,John Edward's Butler,"Alright, come on in. [steps aside for Stan to enter]"
4366,6,15,John Edward's Butler,Just wait here. I'll go fetch him. [the butler walks into another area of the hosue]
4367,6,15,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ.
4368,6,15,John Edward's Butler,[returns] Here he is. [presses a button next to a wide doorway]
4369,6,15,Prerecorded Voice,"Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward. [John approaches and the butler presses a second button for applause]"
4370,6,15,John Edward,"Thank you, thank you."
4371,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up."
4372,6,15,John Edward,Oh. [pulls out a card from his pocket and reads aloud] The John Edward show is not liable for opinions and materials given for entertainment purposes only. [silence for a few seconds]
4373,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real."
4374,6,15,John Edward,Maybe it is for real.
4375,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life."
4376,6,15,John Edward,"Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head."
4377,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called ""intuition."" Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun."
4378,6,15,John Edward,"Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life."
4379,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real."
4380,6,15,John Edward,But I'm a psychic.
4381,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No dude, you're a douche."
4382,6,15,John Edward,I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?
4383,6,15,Stan Marsh,Then you're a stupid douche
4384,6,15,John Edward,"I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!"
4385,6,15,Stan Marsh,I'm nine years old.
4386,6,15,John Edward,"I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche! [runs up the stairs and towards his room as his voice gets whinier] You'd better get out of my house, 'cause I'm gonna call the police! [Stan looks at him like he's nuts; he locks himself in his panic room]"
4387,6,15,Stan Marsh,"You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche! [walks towards the door, but notices some books on a bookcase nearby. He checks them out. ""How To Be A Psychic"" ""Cold Reading: The Trick Of The Psychic!"" ""Make Women Believe You're Psychic! Then Have Sex With Them!"" ""How To Sixty Nine With Yourself"" ...Stan senses the real reason behind John's efforts] Son of a bitch. [takes the books and leaves the estate.]"
4388,6,15,Eric Cartman,"Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!"
4389,6,15,Liane Cartman,"Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon."
4390,6,15,Scotland Air Pilot,Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip to Edinburgh should take about twelve hours.
4391,6,15,Eric Cartman,Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
4392,6,15,Scotland Air Pilot,In the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film.
4393,6,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh, good. [All passengers put on their headsets.]"
4394,6,15,Announcer,"Rob Schneider is a Wall Street executive [Rob walks into the scene with a briefcase, then he's in a hot tub with a beautiful woman] With everything going for him. [now in his office, he gets up and straddles his desk. He then pretends the desk is a horse] Only problem is, he's about to become... [he walks up to a mirror and looks at himself] a carrot!"
4395,6,15,Rob Schneider (cameo),I'm a carrot!
4396,6,15,Announcer,It's 24-carrot comedy. [hops away from a pursuing rabbit]
4397,6,15,Rob Schneider (cameo),Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
4398,6,15,Announcer,[title text is shown] Rob Schneider is a Carrot. Rated PG-13.
4399,6,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh for the love of Christ. [switches from miffed to excited] I wanna watch, fat boy! [...and back to miffed] No, Kenny, it's not funny!"
4400,6,15,Stan Marsh,Kyle! Kyle!
4401,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!"
4402,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche."
4403,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
4404,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them."
4405,6,15,Man 2,"[listening, he approaches] Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real."
4406,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No, he's not."
4407,6,15,Woman 2,Yeah. My sister told me he knew our mother's name and when she died. [other adults begin to arrive and give testimony]
4408,6,15,Construction Worker,"John Edward? Oh yeah, I heard he walked up to a guy on the street, and said his dead father wanted to say ""Happy Birthday,"" and it WAS his birthday."
4409,6,15,Woman 3,"Yeah kid, how do you explain that?"
4410,6,15,Stan Marsh,"[looks around at the adults, then] Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?"
4411,6,15,Woman 4,Oh-ho. Me? [steps forward. The others clap]
4412,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?"
4413,6,15,Woman 4,Okay.
4414,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you."
4415,6,15,Woman 4,My father?
4416,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Does this month, November, hold a special significance?"
4417,6,15,Woman 4,[gasps] My birthday's in November!
4418,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"""
4419,6,15,Woman 4,Oh my God.
4420,6,15,Stan Marsh,"See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man."
4421,6,15,Man 2,Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?
4422,6,15,Stan Marsh,"I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday."""
4423,6,15,Woman 4,[gasps] What else does he say?
4424,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money."""
4425,6,15,Woman 4,[gasps] Oh my God! My sister and I have been fighting over his inheritance.
4426,6,15,Woman 3,That's amazing.
4427,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about."
4428,6,15,Man 3,That sounds a little too coincidental.
4429,6,15,Man 4,Yes. There's only one explanation. This kid can communicate with the dead!
4430,6,15,Adults,Wow!
4431,6,15,Stan Marsh,What?! [his deconstruction didn't work. The adults crowd in]
4432,6,15,Man 2,Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.
4433,6,15,Woman 3,Can you try to reach my grandfather.
4434,6,15,Stan Marsh,No wait.
4435,6,15,Construction Worker,You have to tell me if my sister's in a good place. [Kyle walks away from the crowd and into Jewleeard]
4436,6,15,Man 5,"Yeah, help me out too, 'k?"
4437,6,15,Man 6,I'm next. I'm next.
4438,6,15,Man 7,"Hey, get out of my way!"
4439,6,15,Man 8,Do me!
4440,6,15,Scout,"Kid, how would you like your own talking to the dead show?"
4441,6,15,Chef,Hi Pop.
4442,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you now."
4443,6,15,Chef,"These are my friends, the Cartmans. [presents them]"
4444,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Well come on in out of the cold now. [the guests enter] There's heavy fog on the moors tonight. [closes the door, then leads them to the living room] Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelly."
4445,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Oh, my baby come home!"
4446,6,15,Chef,"Hi, Momma! [gives her a hug]"
4447,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine."
4448,6,15,Chef,"Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman."
4449,6,15,Liane Cartman,"Please, call me Liane."
4450,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"So nice to have you here, Liane."
4451,6,15,Thomas McElroy,And is this the children you told us about?
4452,6,15,Chef,"Yeah, Pop. This is Eric."
4453,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Well, let's see here now. [genuflects and checks Cartman out in various places on the body] Mhm, mhm, mhm. [stands up] Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there."
4454,6,15,Liane Cartman,Oh dear.
4455,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Nelly, you best have at it now."
4456,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in the oven, too. [walks off to the kitchen muttering] Ain't gonna have no time now to baste it. Don't nobody blame me, a woman can't bake no roast and do everything else at the same time. [Thomas walks off to his left] Can't say that the roast is gonna be terrible, maybe just a little dry. [Thomas returns with a stool] But I suppose we can make some extra gravy to take the dryness out later. [Nelly returns dressed as a shaman with angel wings]"
4457,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Alright, children, stand up on this chair now."
4458,6,15,Eric Cartman,Right now?
4459,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Yes, right now. [Cartman steps up on the small stool and Nelly begins to work on him.]"
4460,6,15,Nelly McElroy,[waving her scepters] Na kamaa karash meh nah- [strikes Cartman]
4461,6,15,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, whoa, watch it lady."
4462,6,15,Nelly McElroy,Come out now. Come out now.
4463,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing."
4464,6,15,Nelly McElroy,You all come out of there now.
4465,6,15,Announcer,"At a vary young age one young boy learned he had a special gift. This is ""The Other Side."" [the curtain rises to reveal Stan on set with the studio audience clapping. He steps forward and the curtain falls down behind him]"
4466,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully. [the applause dies down] This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay? [puts his hand to his temple] They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter."
4467,6,15,Woman 5,"[jumps up] Yes! Yes, my Peter! [begins to sob]"
4468,6,15,John Edward Audience Members,Wow!! [begins to clap]
4469,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, ""Peter was your husband?"""
4470,6,15,Woman 5,"[sobbing] Yes, yes! Yes, my husband Peter!"
4471,6,15,John Edward Audience Members,Wow!! [begins to clap]
4472,6,15,Woman 6,Oh wow!
4473,6,15,Stan Marsh,[getting annoyed] Stop it! I didn't do anything!
4474,6,15,Man 9,[rises and accuses] You knew Peter was dead!
4475,6,15,Stan Marsh,"[reminding] I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely"""
4476,6,15,Woman 6,"[sobbing] Yes, it was."
4477,6,15,John Edward Audience Members,Wow!! [begins to clap]
4478,6,15,Man 1,Amazing!
4479,6,15,Woman 7,Ask Peter if he knows my little Billy.
4480,6,15,Stan Marsh,"[frustrated, with right hand over his clenched eyelids] Okay. Let's back up. [each audience row backs up to the one behind it] Not literally!"
4481,6,15,Thomas McElroy,In the name of all that is holy we command this spirit be set free!
4482,6,15,Eric Cartman,"Ahh, Aahhhh! [the adults back away from the bed. Soon, an orange glow appears on Cartman's belly]"
4483,6,15,Thomas McElroy,There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now!
4484,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Come on out, spirit. Go!"
4485,6,15,Thomas McElroy,Come on out hyow! It's safe! [Cartman groans with the pain Kenny's spirit is causing him. Thomas quickly moves to the foot of the bed] Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh! [a timer goes off]
4486,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Oooo, that's the potatoes. [she removes all her costume and heads to the kitchen]"
4487,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"[a few seconds later] Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman! [Nelly stops and turns around] The soul's comin' out hyuh! [Cartman writhes on the bed as Kenny's spirit now glows from Cartman's pants] It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!"
4488,6,15,Chef,The victim child?
4489,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we could Kenny's soul into its body. [Chef looks off to his right. Liane and Thomas follow his gaze]"
4490,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child."
4491,6,15,Chef,Where were we gonna find a child to secrifice?
4492,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"We weren't gonna ask you where you got it from. [Cartman groans once more, and Kenny's spirit bolts out and bounces around the room. The adults try to dodge it ]"
4493,6,15,Thomas McElroy,God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!
4494,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains."
4495,6,15,Announcer,"Rob Schneider derp de derp. [next scene: he's walking down a city street when a pretty woman passes by. He looks back at her] Derp de derpity derpy derp. [he runs into a light standard. Next scene: he's a lab technician working with nitrogen. He drinks a strange liquid] Until one day, the derpa derpa derpaderp. [Rob is shown dancing like a monkey on the street] Derp de derp. [he's in a house begging like a dog in front of a woman] da teedily dumb."
4496,6,15,Rob Schneider (cameo),"[rises a bit, then starts falling backwards down the stairs] Whoa! [hits the ground floor landing]"
4497,6,15,Announcer,"From the creators of Der, and Tum Ta Tittaly Tum Ta Too, Rob Schneider is Da Derp Dee Derp Da Teetley Derpee Derpee Dumb. Rated PG-13."
4498,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience."
4499,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
4500,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! [throws the stack away and leaves. He reaches the front doors, opens them, and is face-to-face with John Edward]"
4501,6,15,John Edward,"So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!"
4502,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No, I don't think either of us can. [Kyle gets up from his seat and leaves the room]"
4503,6,15,John Edward,"They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll sue you for slander!"
4504,6,15,Stan Marsh,"I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!"
4505,6,15,John Edward,Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does that make me a douche?!
4506,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!"
4507,6,15,John Edward,I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!
4508,6,15,Stan Marsh,"Fine, douche! [slams one door on him...]"
4509,6,15,John Edward,I'm not a douche [...then the other]
4510,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now. [Liane and Chef enter the room] It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light."
4511,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas."
4512,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Go on now, soul now!"
4513,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Here, spirit, come out the window. [opens a window] I'll give you tree-fiddy. [holds out some money for the spirit]"
4514,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!"
4515,6,15,Nelly McElroy,I'm just tryin' to persuade it.
4516,6,15,Thomas McElroy,"Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin' [the spirit comes out of the light and flits out of the living room] Aw Christmas, there it goes again!"
4517,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"[drops the money] It's headin' for the kitchen! Aw, Thomas, the pot roast! [heads for the kitchen after the spirit]"
4518,6,15,Thomas McElroy,Over here!
4519,6,15,Liane Cartman,Get it down.
4520,6,15,Nelly McElroy,"Don't let it get in the roast! [the spirit moves over the roast. The others move with it, but the spirit dives into the pot roast, making it bounce. The adults crowd in and look at the pot roast]"
4521,6,15,Thomas McElroy,Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
4522,6,15,Chef,What do we do with it now?
4523,6,15,Nelly McElroy,[turns around to get something] Well I'll wrap it up with some plastic wrap so you can take it home with ya. Should last a few months in the freezer. [turns around with a box of Saran Wrap]
4524,6,15,Eric Cartman,"[entering refreshed] Hey, ah I feel a lot better."
4525,6,15,Chef,"Eric, you're okay! [the others gather around him. Liane kneels to hug him]"
4526,6,15,Liane Cartman,"Oh, baby, your time is back!"
4527,6,15,Nelly McElroy,[lays a hand on Cartman's head and pronounces] This child is clean.
4528,6,15,Announcer,"Ladies and Gentlemen, it's ""Psychic Showdown."" Here are John Edward, and Stan Marsh. [both of them enter and get on stage. The studio audience applauds]"
4529,6,15,John Edward,"Thank you. [the applause dies down. He turns to Stan] Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give my your best shot!"
4530,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience."
4531,6,15,John Edward,Wah-why?
4532,6,15,Stan Marsh,"You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole? [the audience is listening] We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. [more audience listening, reflection. Kyle is present. One man claps, then others clap with him, then murmurs are heard]"
4533,6,15,John Edward Audience Members,Yes. Right. Yeah. [John looks angrily at Stan]
4534,6,15,Kyle Broflovski,"[now next to Stan with fake beard in hand] You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever."
4535,6,15,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
4536,6,15,John Edward,But I do have a special power! I know I do!
4537,6,15,Stan Marsh,"There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself."
4538,6,15,John Edward,"God-damnit, I'm special!! [a rumble is heard, the studio shakes, and a bright light shines from above. John, Stan and Kyle look up in wonder]"
4539,6,15,Man 11,What the?
4540,6,15,Woman 8,"Aaaah! [the ceiling above the studio begins to crack, and a huge red spacecraft breaks through, descending to the ground. Stan and Kyle step back. The craft settles down and a door opens downward to become a staircase. Aliens appear and descend the stairs]"
4541,6,15,Lead Alien,"[with two noses, and a pair of eyes for each nose. The eyes stick out like antennae] Greetings from the Jannex Galaxy. [the other aliens take a bow] We seek the great John Edward."
4542,6,15,John Edward,Why that... that's me!
4543,6,15,Lead Alien,"Sir, it is an honor to meet you. [extends his... ""hand""]"
4544,6,15,John Edward,"[extends his hand and gives the alien a handshake] Well, thank you very much! [looks smugly at Stan]"
4545,6,15,Stan Marsh,"No, it can't be."
4546,6,15,Lead Alien,"I am Quagmar, and this is the Intergalactic BDIU Committee. Mr. Edward, it is my honor to inform you that you have been nominated for Biggest Douche In the Universe! [the other aliens clap]"
4547,6,15,John Edward,What?!
4548,6,15,Alien 2,"[in purple robes, with yellow legs] You are the first nominee from the Milky Way Galaxy."
4549,6,15,Alien 3,[with four arms] Congratulations!

4551,6,15,Alien 2,"If you step into our plabpa feed, we'll give you a first-class ride to the awards show. [the aliens escort him into the spacecraft]"
4552,6,15,John Edward,"No, wait! I'm not a douche! I make people feel good about themselves! [the door closes and the spacecraft takes off] I give people resolution! [the craft is seen going straight up, then off in a random direction. Stan and Kyle look on, then they turn around]"
4553,6,15,Stan Marsh,Now do you people believe me?
4554,6,15,Man 12,Well I don't know. How did Edward know my father died in March?
4555,6,15,Eric Cartman,God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
4556,6,15,Liane Cartman,"Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie."
4557,6,15,Chef,"Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?"
4558,6,15,Liane Cartman,I thought you got it.
4559,6,15,Eric Cartman,It's still in baggage claims!
4560,6,15,Chef,"Aw, damnit! Come on! [they go back into the airport] We've gotta find him! Kenny!"
4561,6,15,Announcer,"Rob Schneider is a somewhat popular comedic actor [he's seen dancing around on the red carpet on his way into the Chinese theater] who seemed to have it all, [now sitting at his desk counting his millions] until one day, he came across a pot roast, [standing in line at Denver International, he sees the pot roast on a table. The roast is labeled ""Chef McElroy, South Park""] and his life changed forever. [he's taken the roast home and is carving it up and eating it. He senses something is wrong] Now he's sharing his body with an eight-year-old boy. [first, on a hobby elephant as the kids watch then, in Kenny's room getting dressed; then, waiting at the bus stop with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman] And he's about to find out [now getting on his desk and dancing] that being eight [now on all fours attempting to kiss Millie. Barbrady and partner show up; next, he's running down the street trying to escape the officers] ain't so great. [standing on the Kenny McCormick Memorial Square stage, suffers the same fate Kenny did back when Kathy Lee Gifford came to town - getting shot and then impaled on the South Park flag pole] Rob Schneider is KENNY!

4574,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[thrusts the bag at Clyde] Throw it away, Clyde!"
4575,6,16,Clyde Donovan,I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
4576,6,16,Stan Marsh,[arriving] What's going on?
4577,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,[points at the joint] Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
4578,6,16,Stan Marsh,So throw it away.
4579,6,16,Clyde Donovan,Nobody wants to touch it.
4580,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
4581,6,16,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?"
4582,6,16,Clyde Donovan,And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
4583,6,16,Stan Marsh,"You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations."
4584,6,16,Token Black,How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.
4585,6,16,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, I did Ecstasy once. [the other boys look at him] Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. [the other boys just stare]"
4586,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,...Where did you have sex with her?
4587,6,16,Jimmy Valmer,"In her... va-vagina. [smiles, but the other boys remain silent] Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience."
4588,6,16,Stan Marsh,[annoyed at his friends' skittishness] It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
4589,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[takes the bag from Kyle and offers it to Stan] Then you throw it away, smartass. [Stan walked into that one]"
4590,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Fine, I will. [takes the bag and walks over to the stump, faces the boys, and tosses the joint into the bag] There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal."
4591,6,16,Ozzy,You kids [bleep] don't [bleep] around with your [bleep] mom!
4592,6,16,Jack,"Dad, we [bleep]ing can't! It's a big [bleep]ick a [bleep]"
4593,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"[enters scolding] Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?"
4594,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come on, Mom."
4595,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"It's going to make you retarded! [starts flipping channels, then settles on a news report, then walks away]"
4596,6,16,Stan Marsh,"It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!"
4597,6,16,Grandpa Marvin,Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.
4598,6,16,Tom,"In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago. [a silhouette of a man running is behind the words ""CRAZY MAN"" and a question mark is on the silhouette] The man claimed to be from the future and ran naked through the city streets screaming ""The past! The past! Oh my God, it's the past!"" Which is what one would expect someone in the future to yell. [a knock is heard on the front door, Sharon goes to answer it. Before her stands a disheveled man with long brown hair and stubbly beard. He's wrapped in a large towel and wears a blue cap with red piping and puff, like Stan does]"
4599,6,16,Naked Man,"[slurring his voice] Oh my God, it's the past! [looks at Sharon] Oh, whoa man, it's you!"
4600,6,16,Sharon Marsh,Who are you?
4601,6,16,Naked Man,"It's me, Mom, your son Stan. [Sharon looks shocked, and the camera zooms in on that. Behind her, still watching TV, are Stan and Marvin. Stan looks over]"
4602,6,16,Randy Marsh,"[joining Sharon at the door] Who is it, Sharon?"
4603,6,16,Naked Man,Dad!
4604,6,16,Randy Marsh,Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
4605,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[rises from the sofa and walks over] Who the fuck is it, Mom and Dad?"
4606,6,16,Naked Man,"No way, it's me from the past! [looks quite relieved]"
4607,6,16,Stan Marsh,I'm me from the past?
4608,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"[genuflects to Stan, who leans back a bit] No, I'm you from the future! [rises, and Randy helps him up] Oh man, this is so messed up."
4609,6,16,Randy Marsh,"[pushing the man out the door] Okay, we've had enough!"
4610,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist, and you don't like chicken. Mom, your maiden name is Kimble and you have a scar on your left knee from when you slipped in the swimming pool."
4611,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"[in hushed tones] Randy, what's going on?"
4612,6,16,Randy Marsh,[in hushed tones] I don't know.
4613,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Dude, just let me talk to you for like, five minutes. After that I'll bail."
4614,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out."
4615,6,16,Randy Marsh,How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
4616,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"But why are you back in this time with us, son?"
4617,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"I have no idea, man. I was just about to go asleep in an alley behind the crackhouse, [Stan is aghast at what he would become] and I shot up a little heroin, and then this electrical storm started. Next thing I knew I was running around in my own past, man. I thought... I was just tripping, but then I came down and I was still here. Oh, dude, it's so bizarre!"
4618,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!"
4619,6,16,Randy Marsh,"[laying hands on the man's shoulder] Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you."
4620,6,16,Sharon Marsh,[reaching out] That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.
4621,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,Thanks. Can I get another beer?
4622,6,16,Sharon Marsh,You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
4623,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,That'd be killer. Where can I crash?
4624,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind his room, would you, Stan?"
4625,6,16,Stan Marsh,What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! [squeezes his eyes shut and buries them in his right hand]
4626,6,16,Singer,"Here we are, face to face, ""My Future Self -n- Me"" 
[Stan and Future Stan stroll down a road. Future Stan has a beer]"
4627,6,16,Stan Marsh,[right at the camera] Stop it.
4628,6,16,Singer,"So much alike, and yet so different"
4629,6,16,Stan Marsh,[Stan's future self joins him in bed after freshening up in the bathroom] No.
4630,6,16,Singer,"One of them's messy, the other one's clean!
[Stan's future self turns off the light while Stan looks pissed off]
Gettin' along isn't always easy, sometimes we disagree
[Stan's future self brushes his teeth as Stan stands next to him, avoiding him. Future Stan spits his frothy toothpaste into the sink]"
4631,6,16,Stan Marsh,Quit it.
4632,6,16,Singer,"But in the end we know we're good for each other
[both Stans eat cereal, but the future Stan has trouble pouring milk into his bowl. It splashes out of the bowl along with some cereal. Stan just buries his face in his hands in frustration]
Two peas in a pod, Future Self -n- MeFuture Self -n- Me, Future Self -n-
[Now they have separate beds. Stan turns the light out and tries to sleep. Future Stan reaches over to turn it on. Stan moves to turn it on, and they fight over the switch until one of them sleeps]
Me"
4633,6,16,Stan Marsh,Hey guys.
4634,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,Hey.
4635,6,16,Eric Cartman,Hey.
4636,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys."
4637,6,16,Eric Cartman,Who's this asshole?
4638,6,16,Stan Marsh,This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
4639,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. That's pretty cool.
4640,6,16,Eric Cartman,Then how does he know our names?
4641,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,"'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows."
4642,6,16,Eric Cartman,Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
4643,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol. [Cartman has a hearty laugh]"
4644,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman!"
4645,6,16,Eric Cartman,That is so awesome!! Thank you God! [bows deeply] Oh praise God!
4646,6,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, what happens to me in the future?"
4647,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006."
4648,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[pats Stan on the back] Juvi Hall! [laughs heartily, then gloats] Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! [laughs heartily]"
4649,6,16,Stan Marsh,[under his breath] God-damnit!
4650,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters."
4651,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?"
4652,6,16,Stan Marsh,"I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him."
4653,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success."
4654,6,16,Stan Marsh,I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy! [gets off his seat and starts pacing the floor] Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
4655,6,16,Butters Stotch,"I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too."
4656,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's like everything I do, he... [stops and then looks at Butters] Wait a minute, what'd you say?"
4657,6,16,Butters Stotch,"I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. [Stan is surprised by this account]"
4658,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[after a moment] Dude, how long has your future self been around?"
4659,6,16,Butters Stotch,Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.
4660,6,16,Stan Marsh,Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
4661,6,16,Butters Stotch,Nobody asked.
4662,6,16,Stan Marsh,Where is he now?
4663,6,16,Butters Stotch,Probably watching Becker.
4664,6,16,Becker,My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific. [laughs. Future Butters finds this quite funny. Stan and Butters enter the house to meet future Butters.]
4665,6,16,Butters Stotch,"See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-"
4666,6,16,Future Butters Stotch,Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always.
4667,6,16,Linda Stotch,"[walks in with a plate holding a glass of water and a bottle] Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine."
4668,6,16,Stan Marsh,Liver medicine?
4669,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school. [an air of determination appears] I need to learn to behave myself! [Stan crosses his arms and gets mad, then bolts for the door] Hey! Where are you going, Stan? [follows Stan out.]"
4670,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!"
4671,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?"
4672,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? [starts rifling through future Stan's clothes]"
4673,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then."
4674,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Here it is. [pulls out a wallet and reads the license. It's from the future, with LOSER printed in large letters on it and an expiration date of 10-19-2043] It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this? [pulls out a Motivation Corp. key card, expiring on 12/26/02] This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?"
4675,6,16,Butters Stotch,I don't follow.
4676,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[flips the card over to see the info on the other side] Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. [heads out the door.]"
4677,6,16,Butters Stotch,[excitedly] Oh! Are we out for an adventure? [follows Stan out]
4678,6,16,Stan Marsh,Here it is. Motivation Corp. [the camera pans up to show the name of the building. Stan puts the card into the reader next to the door. The door opens and Stan heads in.]
4679,6,16,Butters Stotch,"[turns away. Stan stops right at the entrance] I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else."
4680,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Butters] Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. [heads in]"
4681,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? [follows Stan in and closes the door.]"
4682,6,16,Stan Marsh,What the hell is going on here?
4683,6,16,A voice,"It should take about a month to achieve the results you want. [Stan hears the voice and pulls Butters behind some bushes underneath the window. Stan peeks out over the bushes. The director appears with a couple ] Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to be very pleased with the results."
4684,6,16,Mr Brooks,We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs.
4685,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son."
4686,6,16,Josh Casher,"Nice to meet you, ""Mom and Dad."" [they all laugh heartily]"
4687,6,16,Mrs Brooks,"My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin."
4688,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son."
4689,6,16,Mr Casher,"I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass."
4690,6,16,Mrs Brooks,"Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs."
4691,6,16,Mr Brooks,"Heh it sure should, heh."
4692,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Alright, then we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News."
4693,6,16,Mr Brooks,"Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well?"
4694,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,Motivation Corp. takes care of everything. [hands out some stapled sheets of paper] Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives.
4695,6,16,Mrs Brooks,"[reads from her script] ""Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future."" Oh this is going to be fun."
4696,6,16,Stan Marsh,I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
4697,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I can't believe it!"
4698,6,16,Stan Marsh,They've all been lying to us this whole time!
4699,6,16,Butters Stotch,"This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this? [thinks about this a minute. Stan lowers his eyelids to half-closed as he realizes Butters is still clueless] Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject."
4700,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[closes his eyes a bit, then] Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!"
4701,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Eh, but then why did they come back to the past"
4702,6,16,Stan Marsh,"They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!"
4703,6,16,Butters Stotch,Oh... Oohhhh. [Stan rolls his eyes] But that's like they're lyin'
4704,6,16,Stan Marsh,"It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!"
4705,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!"
4706,6,16,Stan Marsh,Who's that?
4707,6,16,Butters Stotch,"You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!"
4708,6,16,Stan Marsh,What?
4709,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! [heads off. This time, Stan follows]"
4710,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. [slides his closet door open, steps inside the closet, and slides the door shut]"
4711,6,16,Stan Marsh,We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
4712,6,16,Butters Stotch,[jumps out of the closet and cackles] Now you know my terrible secret!
4713,6,16,Stan Marsh,"...You're gay? [Butters loses his moment] It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care."
4714,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan."
4715,6,16,Stan Marsh,"But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! [walks off]"
4716,6,16,Butters Stotch,"[walks downtrodden to the mirror and looks at himself] Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver."
4717,6,16,Butters Stotch,How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
4718,6,16,Stan Marsh,"No, we gotta run away somewhere warm."
4719,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Wow, look at this, Stan. [reads from the paper] ""Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."""
4720,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[heading for the phone] Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. [picks up the phone receiver and starts punching in the numbers]"
4721,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Hey look, somebody lost their pet."
4722,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America? [listens for the answer] Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?"
4723,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks."
4724,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[still on the phone] Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please? [listens and writes down the address] Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?"
4725,6,16,Butters Stotch,This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
4726,6,16,Stan Marsh,Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you. [hangs up] That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
4727,6,16,Butters Stotch,"[rises on his knees] Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too."
4728,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Fine, then you can come with me. [heads out the door]"
4729,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Hooray! [follows him out] And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them."
4730,6,16,Stan Marsh,I guess this is it.
4731,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?"
4732,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[an egg-shaped chair is seen, with its back to the boys] Yes, come in, please. [the chair turns around, and Cartman appears seated on it.]"
4733,6,16,Stan Marsh,Cartman??
4734,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys."
4735,6,16,Stan Marsh,What the hell are you doing here?!
4736,6,16,Eric Cartman,"I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?"
4737,6,16,Butters Stotch,You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
4738,6,16,Stan Marsh,"God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. [both boys turn and walk towards the door]"
4739,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then? [Stan and Butters stop in their tracks] Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?"
4740,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[turns around] Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!"
4741,6,16,Eric Cartman,"That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since."
4742,6,16,Stan Marsh,How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
4743,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. [Stan and Butters think a moment, then take seats before Cartman]"
4744,6,16,Stan Marsh,Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
4745,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[lets out a heavy sigh] God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?"
4746,6,16,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
4747,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way."
4748,6,16,Stan Marsh,How much is this going to cost us?
4749,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Eighteen thousand dollars. [Butters looks to Stan for guidance] How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five. [Stan still looks angry, Butters follows] How about five bucks?"
4750,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding."
4751,6,16,Randy Marsh,I think he's pretty scared alright.
4752,6,16,Sharon Marsh,It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.
4753,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking."
4754,6,16,Sharon Marsh,Well that makes sense.
4755,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism. [a shot of a marijuana leaf superimposed over the burning World Trade Center] Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means."
4756,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us."
4757,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here. [displays a few brochures and opens one] What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop."
4758,6,16,Butters Stotch,Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
4759,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. [displays some swatches with poop samples on them]"
4760,6,16,Butters Stotch,Poop- poop swatches?
4761,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents."
4762,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?"
4763,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Now, personally, I like the baby green. [switches to a new swatch] But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house."
4764,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best."
4765,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom."
4766,6,16,Butters Stotch,Well that sounds good.
4767,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice."
4768,6,16,Butters Stotch,Hooray!
4769,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school."
4770,6,16,Stan Marsh,[brightly] Yeah.
4771,6,16,Eric Cartman,"The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office."
4772,6,16,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
4773,6,16,Eric Cartman,Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
4774,6,16,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
4775,6,16,Eric Cartman,"And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. [Stan's excitement vanishes]"
4776,6,16,Butters Stotch,Wow! Neato!
4777,6,16,Stan Marsh,"That's not neato, that sucks."
4778,6,16,Eric Cartman,What?
4779,6,16,Stan Marsh,You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!
4780,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches."
4781,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!"
4782,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations. [throws the brochure away and gets some paper from inside the desk] Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog"
4783,6,16,Stan Marsh,Dude!
4784,6,16,Eric Cartman,Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
4785,6,16,Stan Marsh,"No, that's too extreme!"
4786,6,16,Eric Cartman,[sighs] Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
4787,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! [leaves his seat and heads for the door.]"
4788,6,16,Eric Cartman,"I'm a professional, suh! [watches Stan leave] Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied."
4789,6,16,Stan Marsh,Hey future self.
4790,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Yes, former self?"
4791,6,16,Stan Marsh,"You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about? [future Stan looks at Stan as if the boy were crazy] You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?"
4792,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh..."
4793,6,16,Stan Marsh,You must know what I'm talking about.
4794,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Sure uh, uh, [quickly rises from the table and walks toward the dining room entrance] oh man, could you all excuse me for a second? I think I'm gonna crap my pants. [leaves. Stan crosses his arms, quite annoyed]"
4795,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Uh, Stan, [Randy stops eating his taco and looks at Stan] don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?"
4796,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself."
4797,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. [Sharon and Randy shift in their chairs]"
4798,6,16,Randy Marsh,Oh. You. You don't?
4799,6,16,Stan Marsh,"No. [plants his hands along the table's edge] You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax! [crosses his arms again] And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me! [uncrosses his arms] See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across."
4800,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Well, you know what I think, Stan?"
4801,6,16,Stan Marsh,What?
4802,6,16,Randy Marsh,I think he IS from the future.
4803,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, he must be. [Stan looks at them with eyebrows knitting] It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?"
4804,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol."
4805,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Right. [Stan looks at them with anger, then looks forward with anger]"
4806,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe! [a painter descends from the small ladder he's on] The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!"
4807,6,16,Felipe,"¿Qué? ¿La caca no esta aquí? [""What? The poop isn't here?""]"
4808,6,16,Eric Cartman,"¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!"
4809,6,16,Felipe,"¡Sí, sí señor! [""Yes, yes sir!""]"
4810,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú? [looks in another part of the living room] ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we [sees a sponge on the floor and picks it up] spackle with the sponge. [dips the sponge into a poop tray and spackles the wall with it] See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado."
4811,6,16,Carlos,"Sí. Marrado. [""Yes. Gently""]"
4812,6,16,Eric Cartman,Marrado. Spectacularrr.
4813,6,16,Carlos,Sí. [takes the sponge from Cartman and begins spackling]
4814,6,16,Eric Cartman,"God, it's so hard to find good help. [runs into Butters, who has just entered the house] Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?"
4815,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Boy, it sure is stinky in here!"
4816,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice."
4817,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-"
4818,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I? [notices another worker] ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!"
4819,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up- [the front door opens]"
4820,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Oh, Stan! [Sharon and Future Stan look. Stan enters the dining room]"
4821,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek?"
4822,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[takes a seat at the table] Hide and go seek, huh?!"
4823,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?"
4824,6,16,Stan Marsh,I don't believe that he's my future self!
4825,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?"
4826,6,16,Stan Marsh,"No, I actually have a way to be sure. [whips out a meat cleaver in his right hand and places his left wrist on the table] I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear."
4827,6,16,Sharon Marsh,[rises frantically] S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.
4828,6,16,Stan Marsh,But I have to know for sure. [readies the cleaver]
4829,6,16,Randy Marsh,"[stammers] Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. [Sharon is fearful]"
4830,6,16,Stan Marsh,Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
4831,6,16,Randy Marsh,Stan...
4832,6,16,Stan Marsh,Yes?
4833,6,16,Randy Marsh,Uh... nothing. Go ahead.
4834,6,16,Sharon Marsh,Randy!
4835,6,16,Stan Marsh,"[lowers the cleaver onto his wrist. The left hand falls away, and he lifts his left arm] AAAH! [a red area marks where the left hand was]"
4836,6,16,Randy Marsh,AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look! [points. Stan looks behind his seat. Randy moves quickly to Future Stan and chops off his left hand. Blood spurts out. Stan faces the adults again as Future Stan screams in pain] What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
4837,6,16,Future Stan Marsh,"Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!"
4838,6,16,Stan Marsh,"That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake."
4839,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Uh.. [tries to put Future Stan's back in place] Look, it was fake in the future, too. [Future Stan passes out in shock]"
4840,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?"
4841,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off."
4842,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?"
4843,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Ooo, ah, that's a different company. [the doorbell rings] Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!"
4844,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Uh but Cartman! Wait! [once Cartman and crew leave, Butters faces the front door] Oh Christmas! [the door opens and Stan enters]"
4845,6,16,Stan Marsh,Butters!
4846,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, Stan!"
4847,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here."
4848,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden."
4849,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Butters, we're running away!"
4850,6,16,Butters Stotch,We are?
4851,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! [Stephen, Linda, and future Butters enter with groceries]"
4852,6,16,Stephen Stotch,What the hell is this?!
4853,6,16,Linda Stotch,"Oh my God, our house!"
4854,6,16,Butters Stotch,"[squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his hands] Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now"
4855,6,16,Stephen Stotch,[both parents approach with hands on hips] Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!
4856,6,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, not really sir, I just uh..."
4857,6,16,Linda Stotch,"Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault."
4858,6,16,Stephen Stotch,"What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son."
4859,6,16,Stan Marsh,[watching his words fall apart] Huh?
4860,6,16,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib."
4861,6,16,Linda Stotch,We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
4862,6,16,Stephen Stotch,"We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son! [starts crying as he and Linda hug Butters]"
4863,6,16,Linda Stotch,"We're sorry, baby. [starts crying also. Butters, feeling the love, smiles, then grins.]"
4864,6,16,Stan Marsh,Get the fuck out of here. [Randy and Sharon rush into the house]
4865,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too."
4866,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future."
4867,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!"
4868,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are."
4869,6,16,Stan Marsh,"I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!"
4870,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything."
4871,6,16,Stan Marsh,"I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning."
4872,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them"
4873,6,16,Randy Marsh,"Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!"
4874,6,16,Motivation Corp. Director,"Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!"
4875,6,16,Randy Marsh,"You really did a nice job, Eric. [Sharon holds a box of cookies]"
4876,6,16,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby."
4877,6,16,Sharon Marsh,"Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present."
4878,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become."
4879,6,16,Future Eric Cartman,"[Future Cartman walks into the scene. His appearance is tall, fit, clean, handsome, and wearing a suit] Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice."
4880,6,16,Eric Cartman,Who the hell are you?
4881,6,16,Future Eric Cartman,"Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future. [genuflects] I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!"
4882,6,16,Eric Cartman,"[sets the box of cookies down] Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!"
4883,6,16,Future Eric Cartman,Right on!
4884,6,16,Eric Cartman,"Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want! [The Marshes leave. He joins them] Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!"
4885,6,16,Future Eric Cartman,"No, wait! [flashes of electricity runs through his body. His form becomes obese, dirty, and disheveled. His suit becomes an dirty open blue shirt over a dirty white shirt with a name tag. He also holds a tool box and a wrench] Oh, God-damnit!"
4886,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Av-a-a-alright, I'm done."
4887,6,17,Eric Cartman,You're done?
4888,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice."
4889,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, so how's it look?"
4890,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good."
4891,6,17,Eric Cartman,"But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?"
4892,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.
4893,6,17,Eric Cartman,What?!
4894,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad."
4895,6,17,Eric Cartman,Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? [lifts up a sheet from the desk]
4896,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Yes, wa-a-I didn't think ""hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot"" really counted as nice."
4897,6,17,Eric Cartman,It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
4898,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you."
4899,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[lunges at Kyle Schwartz and grabs him by the left arm] God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!"
4900,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Hey hey, [Cartman lets go] I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!"
4901,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!"
4902,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?"
4903,6,17,Eric Cartman,[thinks a minute] Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
4904,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth."
4905,6,17,Eric Cartman,Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
4906,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents."
4907,6,17,Eric Cartman,Jesus Christ!
4908,6,17,Kyle Schwartz,"Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever. [sets his glasses right]"
4909,6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!"
4910,6,17,Townsfolk,"Hooray!! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree! [Everyone in town is there, and some out of towners too. Seen in the crowd are Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, Shelly, Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria, Chef and his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Broflovski, Skeeter, Dr. Mephesto and Kevin, a Visitor, Fr. Maxi, Big-Gay Al, Mr. Adler, The Thompsons, a freak, Lolly, Mr. and Mrs. McCormick, and Kevin McCormick] Christmas Tree!"
4911,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Stan and Kyle, who are holding candy canes] Hi guys! [""Christmas Tree!"" Cartman is feeling quite cheerful. He hugs both Stan and Kyle] Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! [he lets go]"
4912,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[naturally weary of Cartman's cheer]What are you doing, Cartman?"
4913,6,17,Eric Cartman,I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.
4914,6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us. [That gets the boys' attention] Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing."
4915,6,17,Jimbo Kern,[to Ned] Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda. [uses his hands to make a megaphone and yells] Light the damn tree!
4916,6,17,Townsfolk,YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!
4917,6,17,Eric Cartman,"You guys, that's it!"
4918,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,What's it?
4919,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me! [leaves in high spirits, then returns] You guys, come on! Right now! [Stan and Kyle shrug, then follow Cartman.]"
4920,6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy. [aide 2 sets up a small mic for Jimmy to sing into. The crowd cheers as Jimmy approaches the mic.]"
4921,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick."
4922,6,17,Townsfolk,[sympathizing] Awww
4923,6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?"
4924,6,17,Townsfolk,Christmas songs! Christmas songs! Christmas songs!
4925,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,"Alright, h-here it goes. On the first day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh... gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m... me... a pa... a pa... pah..."
4926,6,17,Mr Garrison,"Oh no. [Mr. Slave, dressed in Santa bondage suit, stands next to him]"
4927,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[breathlessly, comes out with the box and sets it down near the driveway] ...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore. [rushes back inside] And here! Here's some Christmas cookies! [comes out with the box of cookies and sets it down] And some holly and mistletoe! [rushes in to get it, then comes out with the box, setting it next to the box of toys] Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too."
4928,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, why are you doing this?"
4929,6,17,Eric Cartman,"They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them."
4930,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
4931,6,17,A voice,"[the boys look up and to their right] Hoooowwwwdy ho! [Mr. Hankey skips into view, from a house rooftop, to a garage rooftop, to hovering in front of the boys. Magic dust accompanies him]"
4932,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey! [an instrumental of Mr. Hankey's theme song plays]
4933,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[annoyed, softly] Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo. [in normal voice] Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!"
4934,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?"
4935,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
4936,6,17,Eric Cartman,The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
4937,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit! [Cartman bounces around joyously] I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!"
4938,6,17,Eric Cartman,Really?
4939,6,17,Stan Marsh,Really?
4940,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
4941,6,17,Mr Hankey,Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
4942,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
4943,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic. [raises his little arms and stirs up some magic dust. He unleashes it on a manhole cover in the middle of the street, which begins to rumble. The sewer underneath the manhole cover bubbles up and blows the cover off, and the poo spread and swirls around. A small tornado moves from side to side, then clears away, revealing a small train made of poo.] All aboard the Poo Choo Express!"
4944,6,17,Eric Cartman,Wow!
4945,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Wuh, that smells. [lifts the front of his jacket over his nose]"
4946,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. [does the same]
4947,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Next stop, the North Pole!"
4948,6,17,Eric Cartman,[grabs the box of holly and mistletoe and heads for the train] Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
4949,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. [Cartman stops]"
4950,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,Me neither.
4951,6,17,Eric Cartman,"You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate! [moves on] Now come on!"
4952,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Let's go, Poo Choo Train! [pulls on the whistle cord]"
4953,6,17,Whistle,Poo Choo! [the trains lurches forward and leaves a train of poo behind. Soon it's running smoothly]
4954,6,17,Mr Hankey,Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a
4955,6,17,Whistle,Poo Choo!
4956,6,17,Mr Hankey,All the way and back!
4957,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!"
4958,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??"
4959,6,17,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
4960,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.[from a view in space, the train is seen making its way to the North Pole]"
4961,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...
4962,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Here we are, kids. The North Pole. [Stan and Kyle run off the train and put some distance between it and themselves]"
4963,6,17,Stan Marsh,Awww! [both of them release their breath and start coughing]
4964,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,Finally!
4965,6,17,Stan Marsh,"God, it took forever!"
4966,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Wow, is that where Santa lives?"
4967,6,17,Mr Hankey,That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude. [The fortress is shown in all its icy glory. The boys and Mr. Hankey head for the entrance. Two icy door slide apart and a gnome appears]
4968,6,17,Gnome 1,Mr. Hankey!
4969,6,17,Mr Hankey,We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.
4970,6,17,Gnome 1,Sure thing!
4971,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
4972,6,17,Gnome 1,Ten months out of the year. But this time of year we help Santa! [leads the group out of the workshop] Here he is! [the group comes across Santa at his desk reading a list of names]
4973,6,17,Santa Claus,[turns around] Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!
4974,6,17,Stan Marsh,[impressed] Wow!
4975,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,[impressed] Wow!
4976,6,17,Eric Cartman,[impressed] Wow!
4977,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Howdy ho, Santa!"
4978,6,17,Santa Claus,"[with open arms, approaches] Mr. Hankey, how are you?"
4979,6,17,Mr Hankey,All ready for Christmas?
4980,6,17,Santa Claus,I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
4981,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?"
4982,6,17,Santa Claus,"Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end."
4983,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[brushes it off] Oh, that's so lame of them. [Stan looks at him]"
4984,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric."
4985,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[with hands behind his back] Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well."
4986,6,17,Santa Claus,You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
4987,6,17,Eric Cartman,That's what I thought.
4988,6,17,Santa Claus,Gnomes! [the gnomes gather around him] Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!
4989,6,17,Mr Hankey,All right!
4990,6,17,Santa Claus,And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
4991,6,17,Eric Cartman,Hooray!
4992,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee.
4993,6,17,Gnome 1,"This is Santa's flight control center. From here, we can monitor Santa from satellite as he travels the globe delivering presents."
4994,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, cool!"
4995,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad. [four camera angles show Santa arriving in Baghdad: two side angles, one overhead, one front]"
4996,6,17,Santa Claus,"Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone! [the Iraqi adults stop and look up. Two presents drop down before a house, the door opens, and two kids look at the gifts with saucer eyes. They come out and pick up the gifts, grinning brightly. They glance up at Santa, then look back at their gifts] Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!"
4997,6,17,Iraqi Man 1,[black beard] Paka klakalaka
4998,6,17,Iraqi Man 2,[white beard] Anah kakadakadaka.
4999,6,17,Santa Claus,"Merry Christmas! [An Iraqi man shows up with a shoulder-mounted bazooka, aims at Santa, and fires the rocket. The sleigh is hit and Santa loses control of it.] I'm hit! I'm hit! [switch to North Pole]"
5000,6,17,Gnome 1,Sleigh is hit! I repeat! Sleigh is hit! [switch to Baghdad]
5001,6,17,Gnome 2,"Ultimate failure at o-sixhundred feet! [the sleigh swings around violently, tossing Santa off. Santa holds on to one of the skids]"
5002,6,17,Santa Claus,Hold on! [climbs up to the sleigh cab] Sleigh is going down! [switch to North Pole]
5003,6,17,Gnome 1,Sleigh is going down! I repeat! Sleigh is going down!
5004,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Hang on, Santa! [switch to Baghdad]"
5005,6,17,Gnome 3,[heard on the sleigh's radio] Sleigh 1 is going down! We are going down! [more chatter is heard as the sleigh heads for a crash landing. The sleigh strikes the edge of a building's rooftop and knocks away some of the façade]
5006,6,17,Gnome 4,[on the sleigh's radio] Don't look down! Don't look down! Repeat! Don't look down! [the sleigh crashes and everyone who's on the ground looks for a place to hide. Presents are spilled all over. The area is soon empty save for Santa and the sleigh. Color vanishes. Switch to North Pole]
5007,6,17,Gnome 1,"[on the sleigh's radio] We got a red sleigh down. We got a red sleigh down. [Arabic music is heard as the boys look at the devastation] Red Sleigh 2, this is North Pole. [no response. The boys are in shock] Red Sleigh 1, this is North Pole. [no response] Mr. Kringle? [after a moment, turns around]"
5008,6,17,Gnome 5,"Jesus Christ, they killed him!"
5009,6,17,Eric Cartman,No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
5010,6,17,Stan Marsh,Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
5011,6,17,Mr Hankey,It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.
5012,6,17,Santa Claus,[over the radio] North Pole. This is Santa.
5013,6,17,Mr Hankey,Santa! Are you alright?
5014,6,17,Gnome 2,What is your status?
5015,6,17,Santa Claus,"[on screen] Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me! [the other gnomes begin to stream into the control room] Stay back, you bastards! Stay back! [the communications link is lost]"
5016,6,17,Stan Marsh,Oh no.
5017,6,17,Eric Cartman,Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
5018,6,17,Gnome 5,What the hell are we supposed to do?! We're like nine inches tall!
5019,6,17,Eric Cartman,[blubbering] Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
5020,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,Is that what this is all about?! [Stan shoots a quizzical stare] You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! [Stan is angry now]
5021,6,17,Eric Cartman,"It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool."
5022,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!"
5023,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Christ."
5024,6,17,Stan Marsh,[gasp] Jesus!
5025,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,[gasp] Jesus!
5026,6,17,Eric Cartman,[gasp] Jesus!
5027,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody."
5028,6,17,Gnome 2,"Follow me. You can take Santa's backup sleigh. [walks off. Mr. Hankey, the other gnomes, and the boys follow him]"
5029,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,"On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas, [the townsfolk have begun to fall asleep] ...my t-true love gave to... uh... me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring... rings. [one of the mayor's aides falls asleep on her shoulder] Fuhgom... don... t-t... don... four cal...ling buh-irr"
5030,6,17,Gnome 2,We fed Jesus Christ's data into the autopilot. This slide should be able to take you right to him.
5031,6,17,Stan Marsh,"I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead."
5032,6,17,Gnome 2,Here it is. Red Sleigh 2. [shown with its own team of reindeer]
5033,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!"
5034,6,17,Mr Hankey,Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
5035,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?"
5036,6,17,Gnome 2,You just have to call out the reindeer's names.
5037,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-"
5038,6,17,Gnome 2,"No, no, they're all dead. You have to call out the new ones. [each reindeer is highlighted as its name is called] On Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. [the reindeer move forward and the sleigh soon rises into the sky] Good luck finding Jesus! [waves goodbye after them]"
5039,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!"
5040,6,17,Mr Hankey,We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
5041,6,17,Eric Cartman,I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
5042,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing?
5043,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[looks at Kyle, then lowers his eyelids a bit] I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind."
5044,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!"
5045,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[draws close to Kyle] Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!"
5046,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
5047,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh..."
5048,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh ...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du... Four calling biiirds
5049,6,17,Santa Claus,Where are you taking me?? [one soldier seems to order the other two to strap Santa into a chair] You are all being very naughty. [a general enters]
5050,6,17,Iraqi General,"[soft-spoken] Why you come to Iraq, my main man?"
5051,6,17,Santa Claus,[a soldier ladles some water onto Santa] To bring happiness and joy to the children.
5052,6,17,Iraqi General,And this is...? [carries a toy train and dangles a car in front of Santa] This is what you think brings happy? [walks behind Santa] This is material... [thrusts the toy train at Santa over the shoulder] This is commercialism! My country is sick. Sick! [throws the toy train onto Santa's body and walks away]
5053,6,17,Santa Claus,"No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit. [a soldier approaches and opens Santa's pants.] What's going on here?!"
5054,6,17,Iraqi General,"America wants to bomb my house, my main man. They want to kill my wife and children. We need to know... what is their plan?"
5055,6,17,Santa Claus,"I don't know, I live in the North Pole. [the general leaves, then soon returns with two rods attached to cables. A soldier cranks up the device they're connected to] What are you doing??"
5056,6,17,Iraqi General,They say that the Chinese were the first to experiment with a little shock to the testicles.
5057,6,17,Santa Claus,"Oh no. Not Santa's balls! [The general descends on Santa's balls and makes them glow. This part is not shown, save for a shot of Santa's back and a glow coming from the front side. A few seconds later the general removes the rods and rises, and the glow fades. Santa coughs]"
5058,6,17,Iraqi General,What else is America planning?!
5059,6,17,Santa Claus,"[coughs some more, spits, and faces the general] I'm gonna fucking kill you!"
5060,6,17,Iraqi General,"You're not in a position to kill anyone, my main man! I just want you to tell me America's plan!"
5061,6,17,Santa Claus,"Then we're in for a long night, 'cause I don't know shit! [the general glances at the soldier, who ratchets the charger up higher. Santa screams in pain]"
5062,6,17,Jesus Christ,"[blessing an elderly man with a few drops of wine] In nome del mio padre, siete guarito. [""In the name of my Father, you are healed.""]"
5063,6,17,Elderlay man,"[as he is led away] Benedicali! Benedicali! [""Bless you! Bless you!""]"
5064,6,17,Woman,"Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi. [""Jesus, my son can't feel himself."" (he's numb)]"
5065,6,17,Jesus Christ,"[blesses the infant] Il vostro bambino se arguisto. [""Your son ...""]"
5066,6,17,Woman,"Bene, Benedicali! [""Bless, bless you!"" The boys' voices are now heard inside the church and the congregants look around. The sleigh crashes though a window and glass showers down over Jesus and the other people present] La morte rossa! [""The red death!"" The sleigh alights and stops]"
5067,6,17,Mr Hankey,Hooowdy ho! [the churchgoers panic and run out of the church.]
5068,6,17,Eric Cartman,Jesus!
5069,6,17,Jesus Christ,"Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?"
5070,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!"
5071,6,17,Jesus Christ,Santa? Is he alright?
5072,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
5073,6,17,Jesus Christ,We have to get him out of there.
5074,6,17,Mr Hankey,Do you know a way?
5075,6,17,Jesus Christ,"Yes. Yes, I think I do. [approaches an ornate cabinet] We need a little Christmas miracle. [slides the door open to reveal an armory. He starts taking out an Uzi] Lock and load! We're goin' in!"
5076,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,On the s...seventh day of Christmas my t...true love ...
5077,6,17,Iraqi General,"You're a sick capitalist dog, my main man! [jabs the balls again, and Santa howls in pain]"
5078,6,17,Eric Cartman,"This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole! [Jesus looks over, Cartman notices] I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people."
5079,6,17,Gnome,"Red Sleiogh 2, come in."
5080,6,17,Stan Marsh,We're here.
5081,6,17,Gnome,You're coming up on the source of the signal. You're right on top of him!
5082,6,17,Jesus Christ,"He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey."
5083,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Howdy ho, Jesus. [the sleigh lands and a rooftop door opens.]"
5084,6,17,Soldier 1,[clean-shaven] Gankueda!
5085,6,17,Jesus Christ,"[steps off the sleigh and holds his arms up] Wait here, I can handle this."
5086,6,17,Soldier 2,[bearded] Kinkeda? Kinkakueda!
5087,6,17,Jesus Christ,"Yay, look upon me, and know me."
5088,6,17,Soldier 1,Halak balah!
5089,6,17,Soldier 2,Kli malah!
5090,6,17,Jesus Christ,"My children, you should know something. [a dagger shoots out and gets into position by his left arm] I'm packing. [quickly jabs the clean-shaven soldier in the throat, and the soldier gags to death. A gun with silencer descends along Jesus' right arm. He takes that and quickly kills the bearded soldier. He calls out to the others on the sleigh] Let's go! [Mr. Hankey and the boys leave the sleigh]"
5091,6,17,Eric Cartman,"This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys."
5092,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,"On the el- el- el- eleventh of C- Christmas my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping..."
5093,6,17,Iraqi General,Drink it! Drink the oil! This is all you Western capitalists want! [Jesus bursts through the door.]
5094,6,17,Santa Claus,"Jesus Christ! [Jesus kills the soldier at the charging station, then the other soldier. The general holds up his hands. Jesus shoots him on the left know and he falls.]"
5095,6,17,Iraqi General,Ach!
5096,6,17,Santa Claus,"Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus! [Jesus walks up to Santa and unties him]"
5097,6,17,Jesus Christ,Here. [hands him a gun] Can you walk?
5098,6,17,Santa Claus,"Santa's legs are broken. [Jesus moves his hands over them, then steps back]"
5099,6,17,Jesus Christ,"There, they are healed. [walks off. Santa follows, but turns around to face the general, who is cowering now. Santa fixes his gaze on the general and aims the gun. After a few intense moments Santa moves the gun off and fires twice. Jesus comes up behind Santa] Santa..."
5100,6,17,Santa Claus,"I just couldn't do it. [Santa didn't miss after all. The general got one bullet to the brain, another one that split his head open] I just couldn't let him live. He shocked Santa's balls! [sirens go off]"
5101,6,17,Mr Hankey,More soldiers are coming!
5102,6,17,Jesus Christ,Let's move. Move!
5103,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,Eight... maids are... milking...
5104,6,17,Jesus Christ,[stops at the foot of a stairway and turns around] Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! [a soldier comes down the stairs]
5105,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, behind you! [Jesus looks at the boys. The soldier shoots Jesus in the back]"
5106,6,17,Stan Marsh,"[in slow motion] Jesus! [in slow motion, Jesus wobbles a bit and then falls]"
5107,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[in slow motion] Jesus! [in slow motion, Jesus wobbles a bit and then falls]"
5108,6,17,Eric Cartman,"[in slow motion] Jesus! [in slow motion, Jesus wobbles a bit and then falls]"
5109,6,17,Santa Claus,"[in slow motion] No! [fires away with his gun, killing the soldier. He then approaches Jesus and holds him] Jesus. Jesus! [Jesus stammers, but nothing comes out of his mouth] No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch."
5110,6,17,Jesus Christ,"You're a... bad liar. [the boys are speechless] Yay. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh?"
5111,6,17,Santa Claus,"We sure did, Jesus."
5112,6,17,Stan Marsh,"[finding his voice] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
5113,6,17,Jesus Christ,Uh Santa?
5114,6,17,Santa Claus,"[quickly answers] I'm here, Jesus."
5115,6,17,Jesus Christ,Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit. [Jesus takes his last breath and expires. His halo disappears]
5116,6,17,Stan Marsh,Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.
5117,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"You bastards. [behind them, soldiers mass at the other end of the hall]"
5118,6,17,Santa Claus,"[with a gun on each arm] Come on, kids! [turns around and rushes up the stairs. The kids follow]"
5119,6,17,Santa Claus,"Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh! [the boys run by screaming as Santa mows the soldiers down with both semiautomatics. More soldiers pour out, more bodies pile up. The boys sit down in the sleigh, and Stan and Kyle take the reins]"
5120,6,17,Mr Hankey,Start the sleigh!
5121,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh..."
5122,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. [the sleigh begins to move forward and Santa runs out of ammo. He drops the guns and heads for the moving sleigh. He hops in and the remaining soldiers fire at the departing sleigh. The sleigh goes up and away]"
5123,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-"
5124,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!"
5125,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means."
5126,6,17,Santa Claus,"You're right, kid. [turns the sleigh around]"
5127,6,17,Mr Hankey,"What are you doin', Santa?"
5128,6,17,Santa Claus,I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it! [presses a button on his dashboard.]
5129,6,17,Santa Claus,"Hohoho! Merry Christmas! [the sleigh sails above a street and Santa strafes the buildings on either side with more bombs. Each of the buildings is decorated with lights and Christmas trees, and presents appear under the trees. The sleigh goes down another street and bombs another building. It too is decorated]"
5130,6,17,Soldier,[directing another soldier with a bazooka ready to fire] Dakadaka!
5131,6,17,Stan Marsh,"RPG, four o'clock!"
5132,6,17,Mr Hankey,"Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!"
5133,6,17,Santa Claus,Merry Christmas! Hohoho!
5134,6,17,Santa Claus,"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!"
5135,6,17,Jimmy Valmer,And a p-p-par-tridge in a p-peeeaaar treeee. [a moment of silence follows. No more is heard from Jimmy]
5136,6,17,Mayor McDaniels,That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree! [heads for the dais. Her aides follow. The townsfolk rouse themselves.]
5137,6,17,Townsfolk,[cheering heartily] Hurrah! Woohoo! Yay!
5138,6,17,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, finally!"
5139,6,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas! [hands him the detonator by which to light the tree. The townsfolk are glad with anticipation, making fists. Jimmy lowers the trigger, the tree lights up and goes dark, and then a bulb explodes]"
5140,6,17,Townsfolk,Awwww!
5141,6,17,Randy Marsh,"Christmas is ruined again! [they begin to disperse, but jingle bells stop them in their tracks]"
5142,6,17,Santa Claus,[heard over the jingle bells] Ho ho ho! [Santa flies over the gathering and drops a bomb on the tree. It blazes forth with bright lights]
5143,6,17,Townsfolk,WOW!!! [cheering and applause follow. The sleigh lands and the occupants disboard]
5144,6,17,Randy Marsh,Stan!
5145,6,17,Gerald Broflovski,Kyle!
5146,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,[runs up to his parents] Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
5147,6,17,Stan Marsh,[runs up to his parents] We brought Christmas to Iraq!
5148,6,17,Santa Claus,"[approaches the dais] Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention? [Cartman approaches his mom; they hug each other] Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day. we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus."
5149,6,17,Townsfolk,[cheering heartily] Hooray!
5150,6,17,Santa Claus,"Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. [leaves the dais]"
5151,6,17,Mr Hankey,"I'll help you, Santa!"
5152,6,17,Santa Claus,"[gets into his sleigh and looks over at the boys] Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree. [the boys are surprised, then happy. Stan leads them to the presents. Santa takes the sleigh off the ground and away] Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! [the boys reach their presents and check them over. For a moment they look like the Iraqi kids. Their looks change back to normal as they rip off the wrapping. They all get the same gift]"
5153,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! [Cartman's joy vanishes]"
5154,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit!"
5155,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!"
5156,6,17,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! [kicks the toy away. The camera zooms out enough for a fourth person to walk into the shot]"
5157,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. [Kenny walks into the frame.]"
5158,6,17,Kenny McCormick,(Hey guys. What's goin' on?)
5159,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hey Kenny."
5160,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where have you been?"
5161,6,17,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)"
5162,6,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. [walks away with his Haibo doll. Stan follows with his Haibo doll, and Cartman follows with an angry look]"
5163,6,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal."
5164,6,17,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
