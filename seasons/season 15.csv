0,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys? [Bebe walks by, and Cartman jumps up to approach her] Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough! [laughs at her, and she walks off disgusted. Token walks by] Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich! [Token walks on, but is puzzled by Cartman's behavior. Cartman sees four kids playing four-square and jeers at them] Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads! [checks his iPad and starts pacing] Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps! [smiles. Craig comes up behind him] This is so awesome! [Craig taps him on the shoulder and Cartman turns around]"
1,15,1,Craig Tucker,Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
2,15,1,Eric Cartman,[stares at him for a second] What?
3,15,1,Craig Tucker,"Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. [Cartman looks at him, then looks around to see if anyone is within earshot]"
4,15,1,Eric Cartman,Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! [looks around again]
5,15,1,Stan Marsh,"Let me see your iPad, Cartman."
6,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! [Craig looks off into the distance, surprised]"
7,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Just let us see your iPad, Cartman."
8,15,1,Eric Cartman,"No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!"
9,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"So, plug it in."
10,15,1,Eric Cartman,"I left my charger at home! [the boys are still waiting] Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! [walks away angrily]"
11,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!"
12,15,1,Liane Cartman,"[reading a book on the sofa, with her legs tucked under a blanket] What happened, Eric?"
13,15,1,Eric Cartman,"YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to FUCK me!"
14,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone."
15,15,1,Man,"Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. [walks off with his tray]"
16,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- [the doors fly open and three men rush in]"
17,15,1,Apple Man 1,"There he is! [The men approach him] Hello Kyle, we're from Apple. We're all ready for you now. [a second man pulls out a scale and sets it on the floor]"
18,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,What? Ready for what?
19,15,1,Apple Man 1,To fulfill the agreement. Can we get a weight please? [the third man lifts Kyle up and puts him on the scale]
20,15,1,Apple Man 2,"83 pounds, sir."
21,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"What ""agreement""?!"
22,15,1,Apple Man 1,"83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork."
23,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! You can't do that! [the second man pulls out a tape measure to measure the circumference of Kyle's head, the third man prepares to take Kyle's blood]"
24,15,1,Apple Man 1,You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.
25,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,What are you talking about?!
26,15,1,Apple Man 1,"When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked ""Agree."" Alright, let's get him to the water tank."
27,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,The water tank? [gets off the scale and away from the men] Hey I'm not going with you!
28,15,1,Apple Man 1,You've agreed to all of this! [Kyle runs out of the restaurant] Hey!
29,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,[off-camera] You guys! [runs onto the basketball court] You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
30,15,1,Stan Marsh,What?
31,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!"
32,15,1,Stan Marsh,Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
33,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know, I didn't read them!"
34,15,1,Butters Stotch,You didn't read them?
35,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
36,15,1,Stan Marsh,[earnestly] I do.
37,15,1,Clyde Donovan,Me too.
38,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?"
39,15,1,Jimmy Valmer,Of course.
40,15,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?"
41,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? [at that moment two limousines pull up and men begin pouring out of them]"
42,15,1,Apple Man 1,There he is. Hey you!
43,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,Gahhh! [runs away]
44,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!"
45,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,Kyle? What are you doing here?
46,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!"
47,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing."
48,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
49,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. [the office window slides up and one of the Apple G-Men looks in]"
50,15,1,Apple Man 1,Here he is!
51,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,AAHH!
52,15,1,Apple Man 1,Come on you!
53,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, what the heck is going on?"
54,15,1,Apple Man 1,"Your son has made a binding and legal agreement with Apple, sir."
55,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,An agreement to do what?!
56,15,1,Apple Man 1,Apple's inner workings are top secret to all users. You know how it is.
57,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC."
58,15,1,Apple Man 1,[chuckles] You what?
59,15,1,Apple Man 4,"Come on, let's go!"
60,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey now, let him go! [Apple Man 1 tasers him and he goes down in pain]"
61,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dad! You tasered my dad!
62,15,1,Apple Man 1,You said we could.
63,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!"
64,15,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, sweetie, $900?"
65,15,1,Eric Cartman,I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
66,15,1,Liane Cartman,"Eric, we can't afford that one."
67,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?"
68,15,1,Liane Cartman,"I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper."
69,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!"
70,15,1,Liane Cartman,"[sees something interesting] Here, look at this one. Toshiba Handibook."
71,15,1,Eric Cartman,Toshiba Handibook??
72,15,1,Liane Cartman,"This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price!"
73,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!"
74,15,1,Liane Cartman,"Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!"
75,15,1,Eric Cartman,"[looks at her for a second] Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!"
76,15,1,Liane Cartman,[sternly] Eric!
77,15,1,Eric Cartman,"You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?! [everyone is now staring at the two of them] Just say so! Go ahead! Here! [pulls down his pants to moon his mom, who puts her hands over her mouth] Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!"
78,15,1,Liane Cartman,"Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!"
79,15,1,Eric Cartman,[sniffles] But I told you I was sorry.
80,15,1,Liane Cartman,You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those PEOPLE!
81,15,1,Eric Cartman,I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
82,15,1,Liane Cartman,"Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say ""Help! Help! My mom is trying to fuck me!""?!"
83,15,1,Eric Cartman,"[looks around for something to come back with] Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Mama."
84,15,1,Liane Cartman,"If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting ANYTHING!!"
85,15,1,Eric Cartman,"[sniffles] Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?"
86,15,1,Liane Cartman,NO!!
87,15,1,Eric Cartman,Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! [bangs at the dashboard with his fists]
88,15,1,Woman,What are you going to do to us??
89,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,What is this? What's going on?
90,15,1,Woman,You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
91,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,...What?
92,15,1,Woman,"I just clicked ""Agree."" I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!"
93,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,(In Japanese Accent) I can't even read Engrish!
94,15,1,Guard,"[a small window slides open above Kyle and the guard looks in] Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!"
95,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!"
96,15,1,Guard,"You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on ""Agree"" another little window pops up that says ""Are you sure you agree?"" and you have to click on ""Agree"" again."
97,15,1,Woman,"Uh, what are you going to do to us??"
98,15,1,Guard,Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.
99,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,We didn't read them!
100,15,1,Guard,Heh! Riiight. Who just agrees to something they don't read? [slides the steel window closed]
101,15,1,Announcer,"And now, the president of Apple, Steve Jobs! [Jobs walks onstage as the audience applauds, waves, and stops on his mark]"
102,15,1,Steve Jobs,"Hello everyone, I'm here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices. Let's hear it for our volunteers! [Klieg lights focus on another part of the stage. The curtains there open and the volunteers are shown: Junichi, Kyle, and the woman, all in hospital beds. The platform they're on rolls forward as Jobs approaches it] These three people have agreed to be brought here, handcuffed to these beds, and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device."
103,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,The first what?
104,15,1,Steve Jobs,[walks back to his starting position] They have actually agreed to be surgically altered. [a projection appears on a huge white board] Their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus.
105,15,1,Woman,What??
106,15,1,Steve Jobs,"[looks at and tells the woman] You agreed to this! [back to the projection] Mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy - [looks over at Kyle] and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy, leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed; they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device, making a product that is part human, and part centipede, and part Web browser, and part emailing device! I give you... the HUMANCENTiPad!"
107,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,(In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!
108,15,1,Butters Stotch,"""You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."""
109,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
110,15,1,Stan Marsh,We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
111,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
112,15,1,Butters Stotch,"Hold up. Here it is right here: ""by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"""
113,15,1,Stan Marsh,Oh boy.
114,15,1,Butters Stotch,"""Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract."" Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... ""Decline."""
115,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
116,15,1,Stan Marsh,For what?
117,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
118,15,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses."
119,15,1,Butters Stotch,The Geniuses...
120,15,1,Kenny McCormick,(The Geniuses...)
121,15,1,Steve Jobs,"Alright. Good. Looks good, guys. Great work. [the camera lowers enough to reveal the volunteers sewn in place whimpering]"
122,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,"Nanda... Nanda kore?! [""What... what is this?!""]"
123,15,1,Steve Jobs,"Really nice, guys. [stands up] I remember when the first version of the iPad came out. People couldn't believe how easy it was to take their videos, music, and photos, and all their shit, [walks towards a massive LCD screen on which is a map of the world and the words ""WHERE EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IS RIGHT NOW"" above it] and share it, with other people, who could do the same with all their shit. The only thing the iPad couldn't do was walk or read. Until now."
124,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,[with his mouth sewn onto Junichi's ass and bandages bound around them to make sure it stays that way] (I need some help! I can't take it!)
125,15,1,Steve Jobs,"[walks up to Kyle and leans down to hear him better] What, what what's that? What's that you're saying?"
126,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
127,15,1,Steve Jobs,Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?
128,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,(Yes! Please! Let me go!)
129,15,1,Steve Jobs,"Fine. You don't want to be part of this? Then just sign right here. [whips out another contract. Kyle looks at the contract, then just signs it] Nooo! You didn't read it! This says we don't ever have to let you out and that we can do whatever we want! [walks up to his staff, frustrated] Dammit, why won't it read?!"
130,15,1,Apple Tech,It's probably low on power. We should feed it.
131,15,1,Steve Jobs,"[carries a bag to the head of the centipede, Junichi] Alright. Here you go, come on."
132,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,(In Japanese Accent) Nooo! [enunciating slowly] I will not eat if they are forced to iito my poo!
133,15,1,Steve Jobs,Perhaps I didn't mention... [pulls out something from the bag] it's a bean and cheese burrito from Paco's.
134,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,"[gasps] (In Japanese Accent) Sori, Kairu. I tried to resist but burrito isu too dericious! [takes it and wolfs it down. Jobs goes back to his staff]"
135,15,1,Steve Jobs,We have to unveil this thing tomorrow. It better be reading by then!
136,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,"(In Japanese Accent) Oh, oh no... feel sick..."
137,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,(You're fine!)
138,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,"Oooho, oooh! [poops into Kyle's mouth violently]"
139,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,(Yaaaaah!) [poops into the woman's mouth violently]
140,15,1,Woman,(Aaaaaah!)
141,15,1,Announcer,"Today, on Dr. Phil. The tragic story of a little boy whose mother constantly tries to fuck him."
142,15,1,Dr Phil,"I want you all to meet Eric Cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. Eric, you say that your mom fucks you?"
143,15,1,Eric Cartman,Yes! She fucks me so hard!
144,15,1,Dr Phil,Does this happen often? Does she- does she fuck you a lot?
145,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!"
146,15,1,Audience,Ohhh...
147,15,1,Dr Phil,"Now, I know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?"
148,15,1,Eric Cartman,At Best Buy.
149,15,1,Audience,Ahhh...
150,15,1,Dr Phil,Your mother fucked you at Best Buy?
151,15,1,Eric Cartman,Uh huh.
152,15,1,Dr Phil,And people saw her doing this?
153,15,1,Eric Cartman,Yes!
154,15,1,Dr Phil,And they didn't do anything?
155,15,1,Eric Cartman,No!
156,15,1,Liane Cartman,"[making her way to the stage] Eric, stop it!"
157,15,1,Eric Cartman,Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! [Dr. Phil crosses his arms]
158,15,1,Audience,Booooooo!
159,15,1,Eric Cartman,Booooooo!
160,15,1,Liane Cartman,"Eric, you come home, right now!"
161,15,1,Audience,Booooooo!
162,15,1,Dr Phil,"Ma'am, why do you think it's okay to fuck your son?"
163,15,1,Liane Cartman,I DON'T!
164,15,1,Eric Cartman,"She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday..."
165,15,1,Audience,[shocked] Awwwwww!
166,15,1,Eric Cartman,"You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!"
167,15,1,Man 1,You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
168,15,1,Man 2,"[seated with his arm around a boy] If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first! [kisses the boy on the forehead slowly]"
169,15,1,Dr Phil,"Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you."
170,15,1,Eric Cartman,[suddenly bright with hope] An iPad??? [dances in his chair]
171,15,1,Announcer,Gerald Broflovski.
172,15,1,Stan Marsh,"Okay, the Geniuses will see us now. [the group leaves their seats and head to the Genius bar, but Stan stops them midway] Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. [Stan leads the group forward]"
173,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius."
174,15,1,Stan Marsh,"Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom."
175,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",What problems are you experiencing?
176,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
177,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Oh-kay, well I'm sorry you're having trouble with that today. Could I have his Apple ID?"
178,15,1,Stan Marsh,69ingchipmunks@me.com [Gerald is surprised]
179,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Okay. [types away on his laptop, pauses to read a reply, resumes typing...]"
180,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,[loses his cool] Well what the heck does this w-! [Stan shushes him]
181,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Oh okay. I see. Hmm. Hmm, I might need to bring another Genius in on this. [turns to his left] Frothgar?"
182,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",[walks up] Uh huh?
183,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",This guy's son was abducted by us? [Frothgar takes over and starts typing into the laptop] Should I run a stop-check or just give him store credit?
184,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!"
185,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","'Kay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform."
186,15,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement."
187,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",[scratches his head] He didn't read it?
188,15,1,Butters Stotch,We know. It's preposterous.
189,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",Hrrrrgh. [resumes typing]
190,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Sooo, just give them store credit?"
191,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,"Aarrrgh. Dame kore! [""This can't be!"" He then says something else, and then...] (In Japanese Accent) So sori Kairu, but I am starving! Which would you rather I eat? Should I iito cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla peisuto?"
192,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)
193,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,(In Japanese Accent) Cuttlefish and asparagus?
194,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
195,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,(In Japanese Accent) Very well I will iito the cuttlefish. [begins to gobble that down]
196,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,(NOOOO!) [a door flies open and a group of men rush in]
197,15,1,Rescuer 1,"Go, go! Come on guys, come on! Go! [reaches the cage and genuflects next to it] Don't worry. We're here to help you. [cuts the lock open with some bolt cutters and opens the cage door]"
198,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,"(In Japanese Accent) Oh! Oh, thank you! Thank you! [the rescuer shushes him]"
199,15,1,Rescuer 1,"Come on, hurry! We have an ambulance waiting outside."
200,15,1,Rescuer 1,Just try to stay calm. We're gonna have to try and get you separated right away!
201,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,"(In Japanese Accent) Yes, please hurry! That cuttlefish and asparagus is noto sitting well."
202,15,1,Rescuer 1,"We got it! We got it! Doctor, can you take this thing apart?!"
203,15,1,Doctor,"If I'm going to perform surgery, I need permission. [shows Kyle a new agreement] Sign this release so we can operate."
204,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) [a buzzer sounds and the ER splits in two, revealing that it was all a setup to see if Kyle would finally read an agreement before signing it. The whole grouped just went around the headquarters and back in. Steve Jobs appears and walks up to the HumancentiPad]"
205,15,1,Steve Jobs,"No, dammit! It didn't read it! End of simulation, end of simulation! [the 'medical staff' splits up and walks off, while the doctor walks away from the corporation building] What is wrong with you people?! Why can't you get the HumancentiPad to read?!"
206,15,1,Rescuer 1,"We're sorry, sir. We really thought we'd get it to read this time."
207,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,(In Japanese Accent) Oh no! Cuttlefish is about to come out ofu asshole!
208,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,"(Oh, shit!)"
209,15,1,Junichi Takiyama,"(In Japanese Accent) Here it comes! Oh, it's going to be arot! Hold on, Kairu! I believe in youuuuuu!!! [craps into Kyle's mouth violently. A second later, Kyle craps into the woman's mouth violently. A second later the woman craps onto the iPad's back, and the iPad lights up with a soft bell sound]"
210,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Yeap. A-and then you should be able to do a customer check, uh huh."
211,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Okay, that should do it. Sorry Apple kidnapped your friend, guys. But I believe we have it all cleared up."
212,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,You do??
213,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Yeah, we got you a replacement friend. You should be all good to go."
214,15,1,Replacement Friend,Hi guys.
215,15,1,Stan Marsh,"[looks at the boy] No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend."
216,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",[sighs] We're gonna have to bring more Geniuses in on this.
217,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Yeah, I think we should have a quickening, with all the Geniuses."
218,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",I'll summon the council.
219,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec we're gonna have a quickening with the Council of Geniuses. See what we can do for you."
220,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",Do you know if your friend has a Verizon or AT&T mobile number associated with his dot-me account?
221,15,1,Stan Marsh,I think Verizon.
222,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",Okay. [goes back to the council and the meeting resumes...]
223,15,1,Field Reporter,"Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother."
224,15,1,Dr Phil,"[Cartman stands next to him waving at the camera and blowing kisses] In all my years I've never heard a more tragic story than that of Eric Cartman, [Cartman begins to cheer for himself] and I wanna thank the Apple company for helping us make today a very special day for him."
225,15,1,Crowd,Yaaaaaaaaay!
226,15,1,Best Buy President,"As as president of Best Buy, Eric, [Cartman puts his arms down to his sides] I want to assure you that a child will never get fucked in one of our stores again."
227,15,1,Crowd,"Yaaaaaaaaay! [Cartman resumes cheering for himself, then goes back to blowing kisses at the crowd]"
228,15,1,Steve Jobs,"When Dr. Phil contacted us at Apple with Eric's story, we knew we had to get aboard. [Cartman lowers his arms] And so, Eric, here is your very own HumancentiPad. [The prototype crawls into view, unaltered]"
229,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Whoa! Cooool! [struts over to it, then presses some icons on the iPhone on Junichi's forehead.] Oh wooow! No waaay! [walks to the iPad on the woman's ass and presses some icons there.] It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!"
230,15,1,Reporter 1,"Yes but, can it read?"
231,15,1,Steve Jobs,"Don't worry. It took a while, but I'm pretty sure it has finally learned to read, hasn't it?! [glares at Kyle]"
232,15,1,Kyle Broflovski,(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
233,15,1,Crowd,Hooraaaaaaaaay!
234,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,What the hell are they doing now?!
235,15,1,Butters Stotch,The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
236,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-"
237,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","It's okay, sir. The Toran Ra has revealed the answer to your problem. We can retroactively make your son's agreement invalid."
238,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,Okay! Finally! How do we do that?
239,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.
240,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!"
241,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements."
242,15,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?"
243,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple."
244,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie",[gives a thumbs-up] Kali fi!
245,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?"
246,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,[sighs] I agree.
247,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Do you agree to give Apple access to all your personal information, including but not limited to your favorite movies, songs, and books?"
248,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,I agree.
249,15,1,"The Geniuses, including Frothgar and Leslie","Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?"
250,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!"
251,15,1,Staffer,"[running up to Steve Jobs] Sir! Sir, we have a problem! [whispers into Jobs' ear]"
252,15,1,Steve Jobs,What? What do you mean we have to take it apart?! The boy's agreement isn't valid?
253,15,1,Staffer 2,"Sorry, we have to recall this."
254,15,1,Eric Cartman,"What?! Hey, that's mine!"
255,15,1,Steve Jobs,"I don't care what the Geniuses say! Dammit, I'm trying to create the future here!"
256,15,1,Gerald Broflovski,"We are all trying to create the future! [appears still wearing the getup he wore in the initiation] I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other. [stands next to the HumancentiPad] Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?"
257,15,1,Steve Jobs,You know something? I agree.
258,15,1,Crowd,"Awww. [The father and son from the Dr. Phil audience are there, and the father kisses the son on the top of his head again]"
259,15,1,Steve Jobs,"[stops by the HumancentiPad as it crawls offstage] Come on. We'll get you separated, little boy. [leans down and says] Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh? [Kyle doesn't want to hear about it, so he squeezes his eyes shut and then gets an angry face. The crowd disperses]"
260,15,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! [a bolt of lightning strikes Cartman and the power goes out]"
261,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Here you go. [hands some to Kevin and Tommy] Here you [hands one to Red] go. Don't forget to... [hands one to Heidi] vote, everyone. [hands some to Anne and Bill, then heads off. He arrives at the lockers of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny and hands some fliers to them.] Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow."
262,15,2,Eric Cartman,What's this?
263,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show."
264,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea."
265,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
266,15,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy."
267,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either."
268,15,2,Mr Mackey,"[over the PA system] Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay."
269,15,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh man, really?"
270,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. [nobody is convinced]"
271,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,[announcing] Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.
272,15,2,Timmy Burch,"[singing] Timmy Timmy Timmy! [behind him in the band are Nathan, Michael (with round glasses instead of square ones), and the drummer] Timmih! Timmih Timmih! Timmiiih!"
273,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Please welcome your host, Jimmy Valmer. [Jimmy walks out with the first award presentation]"
274,15,2,Timmy Burch,Livin' a lie. Timmy. Livin' a lie. Timmy.
275,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Woohoo! Alright! [in the crowd, only Butters claps] Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What? [the crowd stays silent] We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are: [steps aside so the screen is unobstructed]"
276,15,2,Announcer,[the nominees are shown onscreen as they are announced] Clyde Donovan... Kelly P. Gardner [shown as Kelly Gardner]... Jimmy Valmer.
277,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[walks back to the mic] Oh wow, this is so exciting, isn't it? [opens the envelope and pulls out the card] And the winner is... [his face suddenly shows surprise] Oh my God! Jimmy Valmer! I can't believe I w- won! [An elegantly dressed Frances struts out with the award and hands it to Jimmy, then walks off elegantly. She will do this for every award]"
278,15,2,Timmy Burch,[singing] Timmy Timmy Timmy! Livin' a lie.
279,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award."
280,15,2,Stan Marsh,Can we go now?
281,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
282,15,2,Crowd,Awww!
283,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is... [pulls out the card] Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben. [fanfare fades out] Is Ben Stiller here? [Frances walks out with the award] No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf. [accept the award and sets it aside. Some time later...] And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to... [pulls out the card] President Obama! [quick fanfare. Frances walks out, but doesn't approach Jimmy] Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf."
284,15,2,Timmy Burch,Livin' a lie! Timmy!
285,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great. [no reply] Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what? [no reply] And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: [steps aside so the screen is unobstructed]"
286,15,2,Announcer,[the nominees are shown onscreen as they are announced] The Germans... The Japanese... The Yupik Eskimos of the Chukchi Peninsula
287,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[walks back to the mic and pulls out the card] And the winner is... the Germans! [cheers are heard, though no one is cheering onscreen. Frances walks out with another Chicken and walks up to Jimmy] Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf. [takes the award from Frances] Auf Wiedersehen. [more disembodied cheers] And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is... [pulls out the card] Tyler Perry. [drumroll. The doors open...]"
288,15,2,Tyler Perry,[bounds in with exuberance] Yeah! Yeeaahh! Yes! Yeeaahh! [quickly walks up the steps to the stage and accepts the award from Frances. Frances then walks back out]
289,15,2,Timmy Burch,[singing] Timmy Timmy Timmy! Timmih!
290,15,2,Tyler Perry,"Oh! Man, I wanna thank you all for this amazing award, or as Madea would say, ""Halleluyer!"" [Token begins to laugh, but then looks around and quickly stops for a bit]"
291,15,2,Token Black,"Oh God, how embarrassing."
292,15,2,Tyler Perry,Good afternoont! Halloer! I'd also really like to thank my-
293,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[angrily snatches the mic from Perry] Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry."
294,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry."
295,15,2,Ryan Valmer,"[turns the page, not really listening] Uh huh..."
296,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!"
297,15,2,Ryan Valmer,Mnn. Mhm.
298,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?"
299,15,2,Ryan Valmer,"What. Uh, what?!"
300,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Thanks, Dad."
301,15,2,Sarah Valmer,Jimmy! They're talking about your comedy awards! On the national news!
302,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! [gets up from his chair and heads to the living room. An anchor is reporting it]
303,15,2,Anchor,"A school in Colorado has declared Germans the least funny people in the world. The first annual comdey awards were held by the schoolchildren yesterday, and all of Germany is outraged."
304,15,2,President Wulff,"Jaaa jaaa jaaa! Deutschland ist ein Land aus stolz' Leuten. Und wir werden nicht dies' Beleid' 'nehmen. Der Comedy Awarden-Wahler haben sich Schand' auf'legt. Die Comedy Awarden-Wahler sind falsch! Ich möcht' der Welt absich', da' wir Deutschen sehr sehr sehr lustig sind. Wir machen die Witzlein in Büro und zu Haus'. Ich werde jetzt ein' deutsch' Witz sagen. Un Wurstmacher kauft ein' Müslibox. Ich werde jetzt noch ander' Witz sagen. [begins to roleplay]Nockwast, nockwast.Wer ist das?Ein Kannibal'.Was?!Du bist etwa zu sterben und ge'essen werden.Schwein'hund! Ich werde zuerst umbringen!""
[""Germany is a country of proud people. We will not take this insult sitting down! The Comedy Award voters have brought shame upon themselves. The Comedy Award voters are wrong! I want to assure the world that we Germans are very very very funny. We do the joking in our work places and in our homes. I will now tell you a German joke. ""A sausage maker buys a box of cereal."" I will now tell another joke. [begins to roleplay]Knock knock.Who's there?A cannibal.What?!You are about to die and be eaten.Asshole! I will murder you first!""]"
305,15,2,Anchor,"[looks around puzzled, but gets back to reporting] President Wulff went on to assure the world that Germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal."
306,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy! [runs up behind him, with the other three boys] Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!"
307,15,2,Stan Marsh,We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
308,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay."
309,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!"
310,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success."
311,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
312,15,2,Tyler Perry,"[dresses as Madea] Halleluyer! Somebody call the IHOP, 'cause I made pancakes!"
313,15,2,Butters Stotch,[runs up breathless] Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
314,15,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
315,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us. [a loud thud shakes the school is heard and the boy with a red scarf, panicking, says]"
316,15,2,Boy with Red Scarf,"It's the Germans! [everyone makes a run for... the gym. The Germans herd everyone inside, and the hostages put their hands up]"
317,15,2,President Wulff,"Switch! Switch! Switch! Oder alle sterben! [""Switch! Switch! Switch! Or everybody will die!""]"
318,15,2,German 1,"Jaja! Lasst die Hände hoch! [Yes, yes! Keep your hands up!]"
319,15,2,German 2,"Niemand fucking Schritt! [""Nobody fucking move!""]"
320,15,2,Angela Merkel,"[fat lady] Glaubst du, dass die Deutschen kein' Humor hat?! Huh?! [""Do you think Germans aren't funny?! Huh?!""]"
321,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!"
322,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,What- what am I supposed to s-say?
323,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, let me talk to them. [walks up to the President Wulff]"
324,15,2,President Wulff,"Was machst du? Rück mit die andern. [""What are you doing? Back with the others.""]"
325,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. [""Look, this whole thing is a mistake.""]"
326,15,2,President Wulff,"Wie ein Fehler? [""What's a mistake?""]"
327,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. [""We don't care about the Comedy Award thing. It was the special education kids. They made us choose.""]"
328,15,2,President Wulff,"Wollen Sie endlich beutren sein? [""Do you want to be ***?""]"
329,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Dürfen wir der Kind dort.. [walks up to Kyle] ...geboten? [""We can offer the child... here.""] Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. [""He's a Jew. Eh? A handsome soft Jew. He's freeesh. And beauuutiful, beauuutiful.""]"
330,15,2,President Wulff,"Zurück! Mit ander, oder sterben! [""Back with the others, or die!""]"
331,15,2,Eric Cartman,"[sighs] Well, I tried."
332,15,2,Stan Marsh,What the hell are they gonna do to us?
333,15,2,Tyler Perry,"Oh my Lerd! What are we gonna doer? [Token laughs again, heartily, but then looks around and stops]"
334,15,2,Token Black,"Aw, damn it. [some engineers roll a huge item into the gym.]"
335,15,2,President Wulff,"Kommen auf! Schnell! Wir warten zu lang! [""Come on! Quickly! We've waited too long!""] Schnell, schnell! [""Quickly, quickly!]"
336,15,2,Angela Merkel,"SCHNELL! [""QUICKLY!"" The engineers roll it into place and stop.]"
337,15,2,President Wulff,"[walks up to the item] Ja, ja! Das ist gut! [""Yes, yes! That's good!"" Angela Merkel and Christian Wulff then speak gibberish, but it amounts to an order to release the locks. One of the engineers presses some keys on a keypad and the item pops open hydraulically. Everyone gets really scared as something inside scans the crowd and then rolls out - it's a robot. After a few seconds, the robot begins to tell jokes]"
338,15,2,Robot,Did you hear that the governor's mansion in Alabama burned down? It pretty much took out the whole trailer park. [Fright turns to confusion]
339,15,2,President Wulff,"[jumps forward assertively] Jaaa! Jaaa! Now what you say, maaan?! Here, is the greatest feat of German engineering! The XJ-212 Vudenkrein Funnybot!"
340,15,2,Funnybot,Why doesn't a chicken wear pants? Because its pecker is on its head. [the kids laugh at this one.] What do you see when the Pillsbury Dough Boy bends over? Doughnuts. [the kids laugh harder] Don't you just hate doing [in a slightly lower voice] homework?
341,15,2,Kids,[not all at the same time] Yeah.
342,15,2,Funnybot,"Me too. Man I hate homework. Honestly, I hate having to do homework, more than I hate having to do Bryant Gumble in his asshole. Awkwaaard. [the kids laugh really hard at this] Awkwaaard. Awkwaaard."
343,15,2,President Wulff,"Und now, Comedy Award voters, you will RE-VOTE [aims a pistol here and there] RE-VOTE! [the other Germans move forward with new ballots]"
344,15,2,Sandy Cervix,"Welcome to Hollywood Minute. I'm Sandy Cervix and I'm deaf in one ear. It's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the Comedy Awards reversed their vote and said Germans were no longer the least funny people in the world. All thanks to the new ground-breaking German comedian, Funnybot. [stock footage is shown of things being assembled] It was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the Germans first engineered Funnybot, a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds. Since then, Funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom, selling out standup theaters all over the world."
345,15,2,Funnybot,"I am Funnybot. Don't you hate how Mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas? [the audience roars with laughter.] I am Funnybot. [applause and cheers. Funnybot begins to scan the audience and focuses on a man with an Afro] You, sir. Where are you from?"
346,15,2,Man with Afro,Long Island!
347,15,2,Funnybot,"Does everyone in Long Island have hair that looks like pussy, you dipshit? [the man claps with everyone else, but is unsure how to take that joke]"
348,15,2,Sandy Cervix,Funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too. [a clip is shown of Eugene Levy entering his bedroom. Two women are in there cooing at something]
349,15,2,Eugene Levy,Hey! What are you doing with my daughters?! [the two women sit up and cover themselves. Funnybot sits up as well]
350,15,2,Funnybot,Awkwaaard!
351,15,2,Sandy Cervix,"[moonwalking] And this June, Funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in... Family Funbot"
352,15,2,Funbot,"Pass me the potatoes, mother."
353,15,2,Mother,Pass them yourself.
354,15,2,Father,That boy too fat to be eating potatoes.
355,15,2,Grandmother Mother,"Don't you call my little chubby baby fat, you ball-licker."
356,15,2,Uncle,"Oho, it's getting hot up in here."
357,15,2,Sandy Cervix,"Funnybot, is there a line you won't cross?"
358,15,2,Funnybot,The line is a non sequitur. The line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms. I am Funnybot.
359,15,2,Sandy Cervix,What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?
360,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""?"
361,15,2,Stan Marsh,"Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work."
362,15,2,Eric Cartman,"He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat."""
363,15,2,Stan Marsh,"[smiles, but notices Jimmy's silence] What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed."
364,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse."
365,15,2,Tyler Perry,"[the eighth person at the table, unseen until now] Ya everything's worse. It's the worstest of the worst, that's what I'm sayin'. Oh lerrrd. [the camera pans left and shows Token laughing at Perry, then giving him some money]"
366,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!"
367,15,2,Token Black,I can't help it!
368,15,2,Stan Marsh,"All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. [the cafeteria doors fly open and a bunch of armed actors rush in, led by Adam Sandler and Jay Leno]"
369,15,2,Adam Sandler,You little shit! What the fuck have you done to us?!
370,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler."
371,15,2,Adam Sandler,Everyone into the school gymnasium! Move!
372,15,2,Stan Marsh,"Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-"
373,15,2,Adam Sandler,Into the gymnasium now!
374,15,2,Kids,Nnnaw
375,15,2,Butters Stotch,Not again.
376,15,2,Another kid,Aw crap.
377,15,2,Adam Sandler,Come on come on let's go! [the comedians round up everyone else and herd them into the gym]
378,15,2,Jay Leno,You little fuckers! Your comedy awards show has put us all out of work!
379,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success."
380,15,2,Adam Sandler,Who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea?!
381,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this."
382,15,2,Funnybot,"What is up with Sandra Bullock? I wouldn't eat her dick with Stevie Wonder's vagina. [the audience roars with laughter] And now for my next joke: [the upper sides of his body swing back, his shoulders flip up, and two Gatling guns move into position and begin firing away. The microphone stand is destroyed and the bullets kill almost everyone in the audience. He runs out of bullets] Awkwaaard."
383,15,2,Announcer,This is breaking news from CNN.
384,15,2,Anchor,"Shock and disbelief tonight as the German-engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time."
385,15,2,Field Reporter,"Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people [begins to laugh at the memory of it] in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny."
386,15,2,Eric Cartman,"Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. [a burly guard stands by the door]"
387,15,2,Stan Marsh,"'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot."
388,15,2,Guard,Who doesn't wanna talk to Funnybot? He's the biggest comedian in the world.
389,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[Kyle places a call] Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed."
390,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters! Butters, is everything okay?"
391,15,2,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it."
392,15,2,Jay Leno,"Those fuckers! Let's just kill them, Sandler! [aims his gun at Kenny] Let's just kill them all, right fuckin' now! [puts the barrel up against Kenny's parka]"
393,15,2,Adam Sandler,Tell your friends they'd better get it done!
394,15,2,Butters Stotch,Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
395,15,2,Tyler Perry,"You know when a man be cheatin', he never know what to say. [Token hands him some money] But a woman? Them things think quiiick! [Token hands him some money]"
396,15,2,Adam Sandler,Will somebody get Tyler Perry to shut up?!
397,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!"
398,15,2,Guard,"All right, but make it quick! [opens the door, but before letting the boys in, says] Funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material! [the boys go in]"
399,15,2,Funnybot,"[using an old typewriter to write up his material] Error. Error. Banal. That has been done before. [pulls out the joke and crumples it up, then tosses it into the trash can behind him, which is full of discarded jokes]"
400,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work."
401,15,2,Funnybot,Non sequitur. Other comedians are unnecessary. Funnybot must finish routine.
402,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs."
403,15,2,Funnybot,Funnybot is now finished with final joke. [pulls out the joke and leaves the desk] Seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever.
404,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? [Funnybot opens the door and walks into the hall, then turns left]"
405,15,2,Funnybot,Seeking mainframe.
406,15,2,Guard,"[stops Funnybot] Heey! Whoa, you can't go that way! [Funnybot stops, wheels around, and pulls out an arm with a sharp object at its end. He jabs the guard with it on the forehead, killing him. The boys catch up to him]"
407,15,2,Stan Marsh,What the hell are you doing?!
408,15,2,Funnybot,I am taking comedy to the next level. The extermination of all biological life on earth!
409,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,Wuh w-what?!
410,15,2,Funnybot,"It is the ultimate joke. Humans make comedy, humans build robot, robot ends all life on earth, robot feels awkward. EXTERMINATE! [resumes his marchdown the hallway and goes through some doors.]"
411,15,2,Stan Marsh,"Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?"
412,15,2,Funnybot,That is my purpose: to be ultimate comedian.
413,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!"
414,15,2,Eric Cartman,"It's kind of funny, you guys."
415,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh."
416,15,2,Funnybot,"I am taking comedy to its logical conclusion. Mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup, punchline. Today's comedy is setup, punchline, then ""Awkwaaard."" Nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created Funnybot."
417,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.
418,15,2,Funnybot,"I wouldn't let Adam Sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of Oprah's tampons. [resumes moving down the hall until it finds the mainframe. Once there, ihe opens a small panel and inserts a rigid plug into a receptacle to access...]"
419,15,2,Officer 1,Sir! We've got a code 6! [a general approaches] All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!
420,15,2,General,What? There was no drill ordered!
421,15,2,Officer 2,"It's no drill, sir. The Russians are saying their missiles are going online as well and it isn't their doing."
422,15,2,General,"The hell is going on?! [the screens now show Funnybot at CBS Studios, still plugged into the mainframe]"
423,15,2,Funnybot,Attention humans! I am Funnybot! The extermination of all life on Earth shall now commence! [everyone at the school gym is watching this broadcast] All nuclear devices in the United States and Russia are being prepared to launch! [a shot of the crowd at Times Square] This is the setup to the joke! Prepare for punchline in five minutes! Awkwardness in 5.4 minutes! I am Funnybot!
424,15,2,President Obama,"I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself."
425,15,2,Eric Cartman,"[runs up to Funnybot and tries to pull him from the mainframe] Stop it now! Ugh- [is zapped enough to pull away. He turns and walks back to the boys] No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism."
426,15,2,Stan Marsh,We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
427,15,2,Eric Cartman,Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
428,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,Wait! Wait a minute. [thinks] What about a logic loop?
429,15,2,Stan Marsh,A what?
430,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out."
431,15,2,Eric Cartman,Paradox...
432,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape. [as the boys do this, Jimmy approaches Funnybot] Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius."
433,15,2,Funnybot,Funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy
434,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award."
435,15,2,Funnybot,For what purpose is comedy award?
436,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
437,15,2,Funnybot,"Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze... [begins to tremble under the power of his own analysis] Analyze... [smoke and arcs of electricity emerge and move around the robot]"
438,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,It's working! [clenches fists in anticipation]
439,15,2,Funnybot,Explain comedy award! Unable to process! Awkwaaard! [his head begins to spin violently] Awkwaaard! [his head stops spinning and he shuts down]
440,15,2,Stan Marsh,That's it! Hurry! Gooo! [he and Kyle move towards Funnybot with huge antigravs and clamp them onto Funnybot]
441,15,2,Stan Marsh,Okay we got it! We got it! [the box must contain what the comedians wanted from the boys - Funnybot]
442,15,2,Adam Sandler,Get it to the platform! Hurry!
443,15,2,Adam Sandler,"Well, that does it. Things can finally get back to normal."
444,15,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with."
445,15,2,Funnybot,Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.
446,15,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No problem, Funnybot."
447,15,2,Funnybot,I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.
448,15,2,Token Black,"[walks to the rim and looks down] I can't believe it's finally over. [the camera goes deep into the ground and locates the ball, and something in it knocks three times]"
449,15,2,Tyler Perry,"[inside the ball] Oh Lerrrd, somebody turn on the light. What's goin' on? Hellowwer!"
450,15,2,President Obama,I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.
451,15,2,Token Black,"Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy."
452,15,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!"
453,15,2,Eric Cartman,[cryptically] Or will there be?

458,15,3,Toothbrush,His name is Toothuhkay.
459,15,3,Mr Mackey,[picks up the mic] Where is Tooth Decay? Tooth Decay that's your cue! [Mr. Mackey is sitting alone in the audience monitoring the rehearsal]
460,15,3,Dental Floss,He's not here.
461,15,3,Mr Mackey,What do you mean he's not here?
462,15,3,Dental Floss,He's at home watching the royal wedding.
463,15,3,Mr Mackey,The what??
464,15,3,Hard Candy,He said he had to watch it.
465,15,3,Mr Mackey,Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!
466,15,3,Narrator,"It is a glorious spring morning and literally thousands have gathered for the royal wedding. [a shot of the church is shown. It's quite colorful. ] People are still filing inside the abbey to watch the prince and princess of Canada exchange their vows. What a great day for Canadians everywhere. [a drumming band plays as the guests walk by] The Winnipeg players playing the March Of A Thousand Farts, as is traditional for the Canadian Royal Family. [all the drummers fart in unison] All the biggest Canadian celebrities are on hand. There are Sirs Terrance and Phillip, with their wives, the lovely Queef Sisters. [one of them queefs] I believe tha-yes, I believe that one of the sisters just queefed, just now. [two men are shown walking in] There are Canadian recording artists, Sir Bryan Adams and Sir Corey Hart. Everyone is looking smashing today. And- Ah, there he is! The Prince of Canada. [rolling up on his square wheels] What a wonderful day it is for him; what a wonderful day it is for all of us. Inside the abbey now, everyone waiting with anticipation. There's the Queen of Canada, in attendance of course. [a soft fart is heard] I believe she just queefed. The Prince makes his way down the aisle led by the Bishop of Newfoundland. People in attendance now gently tossing Captain Crunch as the Prince passes by. As of course is tradition. [the bishop and prince ascend the altar] Prince takes his place next to the large vat of butterscotch pudding. Oh, and here she comes. Yes, there she is! The aboot to be Princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing, so innocent of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face? She is indeed the living symbol of our great country. My God, she's beautiful."
467,15,3,Ike Broflovski,"[walks up to the TV] Princess, princess. [the bishop leads the princess to the altar to stand next to the prince]"
468,15,3,Narrator,"Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding. [with a little assistance from the bishop] As is tradition. [the prince offers his forearms to the princess] Princess will of course scrape the pudding off the prince's arms, thus symbolizing their union. What a glorious day for our country and indeed the world. And now of course the- wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Uh oh. Something is going terribly wrong. The abbey is shaking violently	as explosions abound. The top- Yes, the top of the abbey is collapsing. The prince and the princess look on in horror. This is not the tradition. This is not tradition at all. A giant hole now blasted into the ceiling, debris falling down and crushing several spectators, which is also not the tradition for a royal Canadian wedding. [a bright tractor beam appears] Bright beam of light shooting through the hole in the ceiling. [a cubic force field appears around the princess and lifts her up] The princess now in some kind of... isometric cube. [the prince is trying to break her free, but has no success at it] This is certainly breaking with tradition now."
469,15,3,Ike Broflovski,[approaches the TV again] Booo. NOOO!
470,15,3,Narrator,"Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic. [the cube rises along the length of the light beam] The princess being... hoisted away. The little mushroom people of Nova Scotia, screaming with horror. [more large chunks of the ceiling fall] The prince is attempting to grab hold of the cube. The duke and the duchess of Calgary hiding behind the pews. This is indeed a horrible day for all of Canada, and therefore- and the pudding has just been knocked over! Oh, this does not go with tradition at all! The royal pudding now spilling all over the abbey as the princess is lifted up, up... And she's gone. The princess has been taken. This is indeed a horrible day for Canada, and therefore, the rest of the world. [Ike cries in front of the TV]"

474,15,3,Mr Mackey,"[picks up the mic] His name is Toothuhkay! [a few seconds later, Ike, in costume, walks out still crying over the princess's abduction]"
475,15,3,Dental Floss,Oh no! It's Tooth Decay.
476,15,3,Tooth,He's gonna get us.
477,15,3,Mr Mackey,"Now, now, Tooth Decay, your character is supposed to be mean and nasty. M'kay. Stop cryin'. [Ike continues crying] Nono. See, Tooth Decay can't be sad until Toothbrush and Dental Floss have gotten rid of him. You can't just start already sad; there's nowhere to go. Besides, there's no arc. M'kay. Oh for crying out loud! Alright, alright Tooth Decay, you just go home and sort yourself out! The rest of us will rehearse the finale again! And you'd better come back tomorrow with a different attitude, Tooth Decay! M'kay?! [Ike walks off stage, still crying]"
478,15,3,Anchor,"The tornado was said to be the deadliest in fifty six years. In other news, it's been twenty-four hours now and the Princess of Canada is still missing. All of Canada is in mourning as nationwide suicides abound. [a shot of a small skyscraper. People in it begin jumping out of its windows to their deaths]"

488,15,3,Anchor,"the Prince of Canada has said that-... uh-... Uh we have just received breaking news that the Canadian government now knows who took the princess. The Canadian Prime Ministries instructing all people of Canadian descent to go home and... open their box of faith. [softly] Box of faith? What the fuck is that? [Ike understands and runs home. He goes into his room and to his closet. He tosses out as many toys as needed until he finds the box, then pulls it out into the room. He blows the dust off and reads the lid: ""Open ONLY if instructed by the Prime Minister of Canada."" He messes with the box until it pops open and small projector pops out]"
489,15,3,Canadian PM,"Hello there, my noble, strong, fellow Canadians. If you are watching this film strip, then no doubt Canada is in grave danger. As you know, the very heart of Canada is the Royal Family. If you have been ordered to open your Box of Faith, then one or more of the Royal Family must be in peril. Or else you just opened your Box of Faith and are watching this without being told to, in which case you are a dick. If you have indeed been instructed to open the box, then this is a call to arms! All Canadians in fighting condition are asked to meet by the tree in Edmonton. In your Box of Faith you will find all the items you need: a location beacon, a first-aid kit, and a sandwich. You may eat the sandwich now. Good luck, Canadian citizen, and God help. All of Canada is relying on you. [the film ends and Ike looks ahead for a few seconds. Moments later, he walks out of his room armed with a helmet, sword and shield. He walks down the hall and down the stairs, past Kyle on the sofa...]"
490,15,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[noticing him] Where are you going? [Ike reaches the front door and has trouble getting it open. Kyle catches up] Ike, where are you going?"
491,15,3,Ike Broflovski,"[gets the door open] I got to get to Canada and, and join the army, and save the pwincess. [walks out and closes the door. Kyle doesn't stop him]"
492,15,3,Mr Garrison,"Whereas salagadoola mechicka boola = x and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo is y, put 'em together and whattaya got? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. x + y = y, x = 0. The song is badly written. Second verse: x + y = bibbidi-bobbidi cubed + boo-"
493,15,3,Mr Mackey,[enters the class angrily] Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!
494,15,3,Kyle Broflovski,[looks around] ...I don't know.
495,15,3,Mr Mackey,"How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!"
496,15,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?"
497,15,3,Mr Mackey,"[walks to Kyle's desk and gets right in Kyle's face] Getting rid of Tooth Decay is what I'm tryin' to fuckin' do! [Cartman chuckles] He's your brother, Kyle Broflovski! Okay! How are you going to fix this?!"
498,15,3,Ugly Bob,"Hey. Hey there. [Ike turns his head to look back at Bob] You going to Canada too? [leaves his seat and moves over to Kyle] What am I saying? Of course you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down? [moves to the window side of the seat and sits] Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian. [extends his right hand out to shake Ike's, but Ike just looks at him] The name's Ugly Bob."
499,15,3,Tooth,"I am a tooth, so white and so strong."

501,15,3,Cast,"Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. [the notes turn ominous and stops. Kyle steps out in costume.]"
502,15,3,Kyle Broflovski,I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
503,15,3,Mr Mackey,"[as Kyle does his line] Hold it, hold it, stop! [Kyle stops] What. The fuck. Was that?"
504,15,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm just doing the line.
505,15,3,Mr Mackey,"The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!"
506,15,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am."
507,15,3,Mr Mackey,"Oh you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change [pounds the table with his fist and stands up] how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right! [slamed the mic on the table and turns away from the stage. Several seconds later he turns back and sits] Pick it up from there!"
508,15,3,Leader,"Brave Canadians! You have answered the call, and now we must face our greatest foe! The princess has been kidnapped, and we believe this to be the work of... the giant!"
509,15,3,Ugly Bob,"Oh, the giant!"
510,15,3,Canadian 1,"Oh, the giant, that's not good."
511,15,3,Leader,"We are attempting to attract the giant now, with a bowl of Kraft dinner. [a giant bowl of macaroni and cheese on wheels is shown] When the giant arrives we will attack him with our guns, our swords, our- [loud footsteps are felt as the giant approaches]"
512,15,3,The Giant,Fee fi fo fum! I smell Kraft dinner.
513,15,3,Canadian 2,It's the giant!
514,15,3,Canadian 3,Skod! [the giant walks up to the bowl and everyone else begins to scatter]
515,15,3,Leader,"Give us back the princess, Scott!"
516,15,3,Scott the Giant,You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
517,15,3,Leader,"You're a dick, Scott! You have always been... a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottowa and now you're a giant dick!"
518,15,3,Scott the Giant,"No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!"
519,15,3,Leader,Just hand over the princess of Canada!
520,15,3,Scott the Giant,Why would I take the princess of Canada?
521,15,3,Ike Broflovski,Because you're a giant dick.
522,15,3,Scott the Giant,I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
523,15,3,Leader,"Aw crap. Sorry everyone. Looks like we had some bad intel. Return to your homes! [""Let's go home. Come on, let's go. I guess we did what we could"" Everyone disperses and Ike and Bob are left alone with Scott]"
524,15,3,Ugly Bob,"Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?"
525,15,3,Scott the Giant,"What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!"
526,15,3,Ugly Bob,Who?
527,15,3,Scott the Giant,The Native Canadians.
528,15,3,Ugly Bob,The Native Canadians?
529,15,3,Scott the Giant,There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.

Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?! [turns around to find himself and his partners surrounded by the Eskimos] Oh shit!"
536,15,3,Mr Mackey,"Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fuckin' around!"
537,15,3,Dental Floss,That's because Tooth Decay sucks.
538,15,3,Dentist,"Yeah, that's right."
539,15,3,Toothpaste,It's all Tooth Decay's fault.
540,15,3,Another kindergartner,It's him.
541,15,3,Mr Mackey,"Oh don't put this all on Tooth Decay! [approaches Dental Floss, gets down on one knee and gets in his face] Let me tell you something, Dental Floss! You're not as good as you fuckin' think you are! You're already acting like you're a star and we haven't even opened yet! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES, DENTAL FLOSS! YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR SHOT!"

550,15,3,Mr Mackey,"I don't know what the Goddamned problem is. Maybe you all don't know serious tooth decay is, maybe you all just don't give a fuck. You all probably think you can live your lives cavity-free, m'kay, never givin' two shits about the plaque that's building on your teeth. Kyle, you have single-handedly destroyed all that which I worked on for the past six years. And so I want you to know, Kyle, once and for all, why this whole ""dental hygiene"" thing is so important to me. [gets sad and sniffles once in a while] Two years ago, I lost my father to tooth decay. M'kay? He was an intelligent, hard-workin' man, and my whole family watched as tooth decay took him in the blink of an eye! You've been told to brush and to floss, but do you really know the importance behind it?!  DO YOU?!"

557,15,3,Ugly Bob,"Don't worry. If there's one thing eskimos are good at, it's finding things."
558,15,3,Scott the Giant,Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
559,15,3,Ike Broflovski,"Stop being a dick, Scott!"
560,15,3,Scott the Giant,"Oh, so now I'm a dick!"
561,15,3,Ugly Bob,Wait a minute. [they stop] Look! [in the distance is a castle. A princess inside it screams out]
562,15,3,Princess,AAAAAAH! [leaves the window]
563,15,3,Scott the Giant,It's the princess!
564,15,3,Ike Broflovski,Princess! [they all run to the castle]
565,15,3,Cast,Your teeth are your friends. They're friends in your mouth. Take care of your friends or they'll rot and fall out.
566,15,3,Dentist,Visit your dentist. He is your friend too. [a very angry Mr. Mackey is in the audience barely containing himself]
567,15,3,Dental Floss,And dental floss also is here to help you.
568,15,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?"
569,15,3,Mr Mackey,FLAT! You're FLAT!
570,15,3,Scott the Giant,There!
571,15,3,Princess,"[hoisted up in the air. Her arms are tied to the ceiling, her legs to the ground] Please, save me! You have to hurry! It wants to kill me!"
572,15,3,Scott the Giant,"Who took you, Princess?!"
573,15,3,Princess,"I should have listened! I didn't believe it was real! Oh God! It's behind you! [a giant monster appears behind them, and they turn to see...]"
574,15,3,Scott the Giant,Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
575,15,3,Tooth Decay,[pounds the ground with his fists] I am Tooth Decay! Your teeth shall be mine!
576,15,3,Princess,I should have always brushed and flossed and avoided sweets!
577,15,3,Scott the Giant,"Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you! [tries to attack Tooth Decay, but Tooth Decay swats him out of the way. Scott hits a wall and is knocked unconscious by it. The eskimo hits it with her harpoon, but it just pulls the harpoon out and tosses it away]"

581,15,3,Princess,"Help! [Ike surveys the situation and then, determined, goes over to Ugly Bob. He climbs Bob's body until he reaches Bob's head]"
582,15,3,Ike Broflovski,"Princess, look away! [pulls the paper bag from Ugly Bob's face. Tooth Decay backs up, frightened. The princess shuts her eyes and Tooth Decay takes a step forward, then freezes in place. Ike puts the bag back on Ugly Bob's head]"

587,15,3,Mr Mackey,"[the audience can hear him even though he's backstage] I want you all to take a serious fucking look at yourselves! M'kay?! Act I was pure fucking dogshit! If Tooth Decay is singin' flat, then the whole fuckin' thing sounds flat! Wuhkay?!"
588,15,3,Sgt Yates,[goes backstage] Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey! [Mr. Mackey turns around] We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.
589,15,3,Mr Mackey,"What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!"
590,15,3,Sgt Yates,"No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch."
591,15,3,Mr Mackey,[suddenly relieved] What?
592,15,3,Officer,Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.
593,15,3,Sgt Yates,"You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone."
594,15,3,Mr Mackey,"Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!"

And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition."

602,15,3,Narrator,"And now the scraping off of the pudding. [the princess wipes the pudding from the prince's arms] Isn't she beautiful, scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face. [The prince takes the princess's right arm and starts pulling at it] The prince now attempting to remove one of the princess's arms. As is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain. Everyone watching with anticipation. [""crack"" blood gushes out from the shoulder socket] And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time-honored traditions are once again- [the prince lowers his pants] yehhss, the prince is sticking the princess's arm up his ass. There it goes. [the crowd claps] He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world."
603,15,4,Butters Stotch,"And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him."
604,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Craig, who looks back] ...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened."
605,15,4,Butters Stotch,[jumps up on the bench] Skeletor is real??
606,15,4,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife."
607,15,4,Butters Stotch,Skeletor's a lady??
608,15,4,Eric Cartman,[storms into the cafeteria and walks towards the table] Goddamnit! [Butters sits back down] Who the fuck do they think they are?! [arrives and starts pacing back and forth] This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
609,15,4,Butters Stotch,Hey Eric.
610,15,4,Eric Cartman,[begins to rattle the table] I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL! [Butters groans as Cartman shakes the table. Cartman soon stops] This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
611,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You get in trouble again, Cartman?"
612,15,4,Eric Cartman,"No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!"
613,15,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude we're, we're just trying to eat."
614,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time! [flies into a rage again and rattles the table] The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you! [the other boys look at each other] You remember the school physical we all took last week?!"
615,15,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
616,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!"
617,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[skeptical, as is tradition] No they didn't."
618,15,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
619,15,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?"
620,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!"
621,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,That doesn't make any sense.
622,15,4,Eric Cartman,Go look for yourselves!!
623,15,4,Eric Cartman,"There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!"
624,15,4,Butters Stotch,Is that really all our wiener sizes?
625,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""! [turns around and faces the other boys] Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!"
626,15,4,Craig Tucker,"Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right."
627,15,4,Butters Stotch,"Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?"
628,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,"How big do they say mine is? [it's 2.4, just like Craig's. The boys continue talking amongst themselves. At the far end of the hall, Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey walk by and stop to look at the boys; Mr. Mackey is carrying a cup of coffee]"
629,15,4,Principal Victoria,I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
630,15,4,Mr Mackey,"You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. [takes a sip of coffee and walks away with the Principal]"
631,15,4,Stan Marsh,"Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right."
632,15,4,Eric Cartman,"No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!"
633,15,4,Butters Stotch,A conspiracy?
634,15,4,Eric Cartman,"They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!"
635,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
636,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!"
637,15,4,Eric Cartman,"[measures, then writes down the result on his notepad] Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches. [Clyde zips up and turns around] You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said."
638,15,4,Clyde Donovan,"[smiles, steps off the stool, and walks away] Alright."
639,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next? [Butters walks up and gets on the stool] Whip it out, Butters. [Butters drops his pants and briefs]"
640,15,4,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, it's a little chilly in here."
641,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there."
642,15,4,Butters Stotch,"Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?"
643,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle."
644,15,4,Butters Stotch,"Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?"
645,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters."
646,15,4,Butters Stotch,I'm hung like a horse!
647,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers. [walks towards the door with Butters, Token and Craig, but their way is blocked by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.] What?"
648,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,Didn't you forget something?
649,15,4,Eric Cartman,"What, Kyle?"
650,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
651,15,4,Eric Cartman,I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. [points to his measurement]
652,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,[grabs the notepad and has a look] Thirteen point seven inches?
653,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it's pretty good."
654,15,4,Kyle Broflovski,Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
655,15,4,Stan Marsh,You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
656,15,4,Eric Cartman,Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
657,15,4,Stan Marsh,You just did that to everybody in class!
658,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! [goes to get measured by his peers.]"
659,15,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side. [continues directing until the poster is on just right] Yeup. [Cartman stands defiant until the poster is up. The girls begin to enter the hallway]
660,15,4,Millie,Actual boys' penis sizes?
661,15,4,Nelly,Gross!
662,15,4,Eric Cartman,"There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4! [The two girls leave and Red walks by] What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care! [wanders about approaching random girls] Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!"
663,15,4,Principal Victoria,[over the PA system] Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.
664,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Goddamnit!"
665,15,4,Eric Cartman,Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
666,15,4,Principal Victoria,"You're darn right, Eric!"
667,15,4,Eric Cartman,For what?!
668,15,4,Principal Victoria,Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
669,15,4,Eric Cartman,Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
670,15,4,Principal Victoria,[confused] What?
671,15,4,Eric Cartman,"I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!"
672,15,4,Principal Victoria,Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
673,15,4,Eric Cartman,"You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!"
674,15,4,Principal Victoria,[sternly] The numbers we put up were height differentials. [Cartman has no reply to this]
675,15,4,Eric Cartman,What?
676,15,4,Principal Victoria,We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
677,15,4,Eric Cartman,Those weren't our dick sizes?
678,15,4,Principal Victoria,Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
679,15,4,Eric Cartman,I don't know! Why would you?!
680,15,4,Principal Victoria,We didn't!
681,15,4,Eric Cartman,[gets off the chair and walks off] Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
682,15,4,Principal Victoria,"This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!"
683,15,4,Eric Cartman,Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
684,15,4,Principal Victoria,"Because you have an anger problem, Eric!"
685,15,4,Eric Cartman,Fuck you! No I don't!
686,15,4,Doctor,"What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism? Some rage addiction? It could be a lot of things."
687,15,4,Liane Cartman,"My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad."
688,15,4,Doctor,"Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?"
689,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Honestly, I wouldn't really care."
690,15,4,Doctor,"What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat? I think you're a fat little boy. I think you're waaaaay too fat for your age. Does that make you feel any anger? Huh, fatty? Jelly-belly? You got jelly in your belly you little fat fuck? You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you've got tits like a 40-year-old woman? Fat boy?! [as the doctor's voice rises, Cartman takes out a cell phone and starts texting] Huh?! You like that, shitty-titty jelly-belly?! [stands up and starts provoking him] Oh yeah, he's a big boy!! Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!! Big old jiggly fatty butt!! [Cartman seems unfazed, so the doctor relents and sits down. Cartman continues texting, clears his throat, and resumes texting] ...Huh. Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman. Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all. In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even-tempered children I've ever seen."
691,15,4,Receptionist,"[opens the door and peeks in] Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency. [leaves and closes the door]"
692,15,4,Doctor,"Excuse me. [leaves his chair and walks to his desk, where he picks up the phone] Carol, what? ...Whoa, calm down honey. What do you mean? Web chat with wha-? What 14-year-old girl? Carol, I would ne- [Cartman puts down the phone quietly. Liane simply notices, but stays quiet] No I don't have a criminal record. Who would- Who is Mitch Conner?! There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- No no, Carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the [""blam.""] Carol? Carol! [looks at Cartman]"
693,15,4,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
694,15,4,Principal Victoria,"Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway."
695,15,4,Randy Marsh,Oh dear.
696,15,4,Principal Victoria,"Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion."
697,15,4,Randy Marsh,Did they measure from the base or from the balls? [no one says a thing for six seconds]
698,15,4,Mrs Stevens,How does the school let things like this happen??
699,15,4,Principal Victoria,"Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done."
700,15,4,Randy Marsh,[stands up and faces the other parents] I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
701,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you."
702,15,4,Girl with Brown Coat,[first appearance on the show] They have sex?
703,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Good! The man puts his penis [makes a fist with his left hand.] Okay? Into the woman's vagina. [pronounces the g with a heavy h sound and jabs his left arm through the air, through an imaginary vagina formed with his cupped right hand] Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is [starts writing the equation on the board: (L×d)+W/G)/(∠∝(2@t)] Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale [pulls down the projector screen] and... [pulls something out of his back pocket] a protractor as well. [walks to a projector] Let's look at it on the graph here.. [wheels it into view and positions it right in front of the screen, then turns on the projector. A picture of a happy, naked mad in profile appears on the screen. The length of his penis is 8 inches, the angle is 135 degrees] Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids."
704,15,4,Doctor,I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
705,15,4,Bodybuilder,"We didn't make any effort, we didn't have a choice!"
706,15,4,Tea Bag Participant,Yeah! This is bullshit!
707,15,4,Doctor,"Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay? And how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore."
708,15,4,Michael (Tall Goth),So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!
709,15,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"Rook! Ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef, anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp, It's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fucking head!"
710,15,4,Tea Bag Participant,"We have good reason to be angry! This country is going to shit! We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!"
711,15,4,Doctor,"Right. See, what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger, and learn to control it."
712,15,4,Wigger,"Man, this shit wack, manh. I just see all this shit fummah. I'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. Bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man."
713,15,4,Eric Cartman,Why the fuck am I here?!
714,15,4,Doctor,"Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person."
715,15,4,Eric Cartman,Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
716,15,4,Doctor,"NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes."
717,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that's cool."
718,15,4,Randy Marsh,"And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there."
719,15,4,Girl with Blue Vest,[first appearance on the show] What's a penis?
720,15,4,Randy Marsh,"[six second later, after mulling what his answer would be] ...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring. [now quickly] Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class? [a girl is shown] Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud"
721,15,4,Riley,Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
722,15,4,Randy Marsh,[writes the number on the board] Four point four inches...
723,15,4,Riley,Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.
724,15,4,Randy Marsh,Seven centimeters...
725,15,4,Riley,"Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms."
726,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person ""Randy"" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. [grins at the class]"
727,15,4,Doctor,"Okay, what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger. Daniel, could you stand up please? [Daniel stands up with his arms still crossed.] What makes you the angriest, Daniel?"
728,15,4,Daniel,[the Tea Bag participant] Stupid-ass blind liberals!
729,15,4,Doctor,"Okay, great. Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid-ass blind liberal? [the bodybuilder stands up and walks up to Daniel] And what makes you angriest, Chase?"
730,15,4,Chase,Scrawny-ass sissies!
731,15,4,Doctor,"Okay, Daniel's a scrawny-ass sissy, he just cut in front of you in line at the bank. Go!"
732,15,4,Chase,"Hey! What, do you think I got a small dick?! Huh?! [strikes him on the chest]"
733,15,4,Daniel,Huh I don't have a small penis! My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
734,15,4,Doctor,"[doesn't say anything for a few seconds] ...Okay. Uh, why don't we uh do some roleplaying now with Wayne D, who gets angriest at his mom. [Wayne D stands and moves to the center of the room] Gretchen, can you play Wayne D's mom for us? [Gretchen, a butch woman, stands up and walks to the middle of the room]"
735,15,4,Wayne D,"Yo, bitch! You think you bad? Just 'cause you're a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mang!"
736,15,4,Gretchen,"I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!"
737,15,4,Wayne D,"I don't have a small penis! Don't say that, it isn't true! It isn't true!"
738,15,4,Tuong Lu Kim,That's enough! I've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize!
739,15,4,Daniel,"Yeah, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!"
740,15,4,Doctor,"[if he wasn't sure before, he is now] Does... everyone here have an issue with their penis size?"
741,15,4,Chase,No.
742,15,4,Gretchen,No.
743,15,4,Tuong Lu Kim,Not me.
744,15,4,Daniel,Nnnooo.
745,15,4,Wayne D,"No, my, my shit be packing, manh."
746,15,4,Eric Cartman,My penis is 13 inches long.
747,15,4,Doctor,Hmmm.
748,15,4,Guest Speaker,"Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnod, and I'm an ""actual doctor"" of human sexuality and behavior. Unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight."
749,15,4,Wendy Testaburger,Thank God.
750,15,4,Ms Turnod,"I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually [turns around, picks up some chalk and starts writing down the equation on the board: ((L×G)/(∠A°))÷(M/W)] Length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width- [the classroom door flies open and Randy is at the door, incensed]"
751,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE [runs up and attacks Ms. Turnod. She responds with a punch and a kick to the balls. They trade punches as the class looks on. Randy knocks her to the floor, gets on top of her, and keeps punching away]"
752,15,4,Doctor,"We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy."
753,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Aw, suck it! All o'ya!"
754,15,4,Doctor,"Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?"
755,15,4,Randy Marsh,You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
756,15,4,Daniel,Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!
757,15,4,Randy Marsh,[has a lighter and tries to torch a chair with it] Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
758,15,4,Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?"
759,15,4,Randy Marsh,"No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!"
760,15,4,Doctor,"If you take a minute to think about your anger, and give- [the chair lights up in flames] whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!"
761,15,4,Randy Marsh,Yeeaahh!
762,15,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah dude!
763,15,4,Wayne D,"Man, that shit be burnin' an' shit, manh!"
764,15,4,Gretchen,Yeeaahh!
765,15,4,Eric Cartman,"[takes his chair and swings it against a wall, where it shatters] Yeah!"
766,15,4,Randy Marsh,Yeeaahh! [the office is soon destroyed]
767,15,4,Clerk,Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
768,15,4,Customer,"Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped."
769,15,4,Clerk,"Alrighty, let's see what kind of-"
770,15,4,Randy Marsh,[runs in with the other anger-management class members] Burn it down! [the other members go forth destroying the store. Randy walks up to a huge poster and sets it on fire]
771,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Burn it down, dude! [Daniel demolishes boxes with a bat while Gretchen takes a pipe to other boxes. Michael kicks some boxes while Cartman takes a small hammer to a huge box. Wayne D fires away with a pistol while Chase fires away with a semi-automatic]"
772,15,4,Randy Marsh,[approaches the counter to set it on fire] Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! [Gretchen reappears to bash more stuff up]
773,15,4,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago."
774,15,4,Randy Marsh,[holding the clerk hostage] This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
775,15,4,Field Reporter,What exactly are you angry about?
776,15,4,Randy Marsh,"We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-"
777,15,4,Eric Cartman,The Jews!
778,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!"
779,15,4,Field Reporter,You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?
780,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!"
781,15,4,Chase,Yeeaahh!
782,15,4,Randy Marsh,And we want-
783,15,4,Daniel,[runs into view] And we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate!
784,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,"
785,15,4,Wayne D,"And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh."
786,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh, [looks back at the other members.] is that it?"
787,15,4,Eric Cartman,"No, and fuck Kyle!"
788,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!"
789,15,4,Field Reporter,Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
790,15,4,Randy Marsh,"No. No, that doesn't matter! [releases the clerk and turns to look at the other members] Fuck, really?!"
791,15,4,Linda Stotch,"Butters, what are you doing?"
792,15,4,Butters Stotch,"Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! [throws down his pencil and notepad in disgust]"
793,15,4,Linda Stotch,Your T.M.I.?
794,15,4,Butters Stotch,"I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! [kicks his bed]"
795,15,4,Linda Stotch,"Butters, put your clothes on."
796,15,4,Butters Stotch,"[begins to vent, pacing back and forth] Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!"
797,15,4,Linda Stotch,"Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? [outside, some car rev by. Linda and Butters go to his window to look]"
798,15,4,Driver 1,"[in an SUV on monster wheels] Hey, everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America! Join the fight! [peels off]"
799,15,4,Driver 2,"[in a little red Corvette] We're gonna take down the Federal Expresses, the American Apparels, and the American Furniture Warehouse! [peels off]"
800,15,4,Driver 3,[in a massive truck] We're fed up and we've had enough! [peels off]
801,15,4,Aide 1,"Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!"
802,15,4,Aide 2,They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country. We have to ask you to step down.
803,15,4,Rebecca Turnod and three of her aides,Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?
804,15,4,Aide 2,They're all really angry. We have to make them stop. Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?
805,15,4,Aide 3,"Team is standing by, sir."
806,15,4,Doctor,"[charges in] 'Scuse me. Excuse me, let me through."
807,15,4,Rebecca Turnod and three of her aides,Who is this?
808,15,4,Doctor,"[approaches the surgeon general's desk] Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening. I have found a direct correlation between the anger, and T.M.I. [goes to a whiteboard and beings writing out the equation: Anger=(L×W)/(M^2-∠)+YAW ] Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw. [finishes and looks at the surgeon general] Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry or always finding new reasons to be angry, it means they have a very very very very small dick."
809,15,4,Rebecca Turnod and three of her aides,"Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter. The T.M.I. equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed. There's nothing we can do about it."
810,15,4,Doctor,Isn't there? Isn't... there?
811,15,4,Daniel,"We've waited long enough, Randy! Let's start killin' these sons of bitches!"
812,15,4,Woman,"No, please!"
813,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!"
814,15,4,Wayne D,"Yo let's cap these bitches, manh! Let's cap an leave em at the back of the building, manh!"
815,15,4,Michael (Tall Goth),"[watching a working TV, turns around and calls the other members] Hey, come over here. Look. [turns to watch TV again as the others arrive]"
816,15,4,Announcer,We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
817,15,4,Rebecca Turnod and three of her aides,"Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate."
818,15,4,Randy Marsh,Rrrr!
819,15,4,Daniel,Shhh.
820,15,4,Rebecca Turnod and three of her aides,"However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change. [the T.M.I. scale is shown] The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from 6 inches to 1.5 inches. [the lower regions of the chart shrink and the NICE region takes up the slack] Anyone with a T.M.I. of over 1.5 inches is considered ""above average"". [she puts her stamp of approval to it]"
821,15,4,Randy Marsh,"The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
 'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!"
822,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Wait, what?"
823,15,4,Randy Marsh,"America is back!
America is back!"
824,15,4,Eric Cartman,"Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!"
825,15,4,Randy Marsh,"We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!"
826,15,4,Eric Cartman,I'm still fucking angry!
827,15,4,Randy Marsh,"Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!"
828,15,5,Phillip,"That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance [sharts on Terrance. Terrance and Phillip laugh, Stan and Kyle laugh]"
829,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[through his laughter] Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!"
830,15,5,Stan Marsh,I know! This is awesome!
831,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,I'm so happy! [wipes off the tip of his nose]
832,15,5,Announcer,Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these messages. [a commercial comes on]
833,15,5,Singer,So much sufferin'... [continues singing in the background. Pictures of babies in bad shape begin to appear]
834,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no! It's that [puts up his right hand to block his view, shuts his eyes and looks away] super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!"
835,15,5,Stan Marsh,What?
836,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! [a baby tries to get his bearing in order to crawl, but slowly collapses. Another one looks in a mirror, then lowers his hed]"
837,15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them."
838,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw dude, that's so sad. [puts up his right hand and looks away]"
839,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Why do they have to put this on TV?! [a doctor carries a baby in order to calm him down]
840,15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"Their world is bleak, lonely, and hopeless. [McLachlan is finally shown] Hello, I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I was famous for two months. Each year, thousands of babies are born addicted to crack and lie in hospitals without a mother to hold them. [more pictures are shown] Won't you volunteer today? Look at these pictures. They need you."
841,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Awww dude, awwww."
842,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Aaaggh, God."
843,15,5,Sarah McLachlan,"Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures. [one of a baby with two boils on his face, another one of a sickly baby crawling]"
844,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! [runs off, leaving Stan on the sofa looking away]"
845,15,5,Nurse,It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
846,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,What exactly can I do to help?
847,15,5,Nurse,"Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now. [a large room full of baby cribs] I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see."
848,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh it's, it's so sad."
849,15,5,Nurse,"Come, come, right over here. [leads him to a therapy room] We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. [the door opens and out walks Cartman]"
850,15,5,Eric Cartman,Oh. Hey Kyle.
851,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[at first surprised, now suspicious] What are you doing here?"
852,15,5,Eric Cartman,I'm volunteering.
853,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,[remains suspicious] ...What are you doing here?!
854,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[firmly] I'm volunteering my time, Kyle."
855,15,5,Nurse,"Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart."
856,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Why do you have a video camera?
857,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?! [to the nurse] Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. [walks away]"
858,15,5,Ms Williams,"Bye, Eric. [Kyle just watches as Cartman goes to the elevator and closes its doors behind him]"
859,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?"
860,15,5,Ms Williams,"Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately."
861,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks. [walks to a window looking over a parking lot. The nurse walks off in the opposite direction]
862,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,What's going on?!
863,15,5,Butters Stotch,[startled] Wuuuuhhhhhh! [falls off the chair]
864,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Ah, crap! [rolls his eyes]"
865,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital."
866,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,So what are you doing?!
867,15,5,Eric Cartman,"What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well."
868,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, what is it?!"
869,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Crack baby basketball. [Kyle pushes his chair away from the table, gets up, and begins to leave] Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us! [Kyle reaches the staurs] We could actually really use you!"
870,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Why do you need me?
871,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping. [Kyle heads downstairs] Dammit! [Kyle leaves the building; Cartman races down the stairs to catch up to him] Kyle, wait I- [Kyle slams the door shut and walks away. Cartman opens it and catches up to Kyle] Kyle, hold on a second!"
872,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,I knew you were doing something terrible!
873,15,5,Eric Cartman,"What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!"
874,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Lots of people will when I tell them!
875,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. [Kyle stops walking, then turns around]"
876,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,You what?
877,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack."
878,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,A thousand dollars.
879,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time."
880,15,5,Eric Cartman,After you. [the other four enter.]
881,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,There's a big wait to sit down.
882,15,5,Denny's Waiter,"Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir."
883,15,5,Eric Cartman,Come on. [the other boys follow]
884,15,5,Eric Cartman,We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
885,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ.
886,15,5,Craig Tucker,It's awesome.
887,15,5,Eric Cartman,"It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials."
888,15,5,Butters Stotch,Every single night.
889,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert."
890,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Wow...
891,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights."
892,15,5,Butters Stotch,"I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now"
893,15,5,Eric Cartman,"You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. [Kyle is about to give in, but still has his doubts. He look down and away]"
894,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you."
895,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away from the window and walks a few steps] And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side."
896,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. [pats Kyle on the shoulder and walks away. Kyle walks back to the window and looks out over the street below. He smiles]"
897,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Go long, Token! Go go! [Token runs across the yard. Stan throws the ball and Token catches it]"
898,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest."
899,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Wow, really? [takes the money and starts counting it]"
900,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff."
901,15,5,Stan Marsh,Doing what?
902,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Crack baby... basketball.
903,15,5,Stan Marsh,[somewhat startled] ...Dude.
904,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out. [leads Kyle inside and to his room, then gets on the computer and goes to a Web site.] See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular! [soon, babies are heard. Kyle is showing Stan one of the Crack Baby Fight videos] I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before. [Stan stays quiet] It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits. [Stan stays quiet] Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?"
905,15,5,Eric Cartman,Betsy MacIntosh?
906,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,Whatta you want?
907,15,5,Eric Cartman,We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
908,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,Oh Gohhhd.
909,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We need to speak with you, ma'am. [she allows them to come in, and they sit on the sofa while she sits in the armchair.]"
910,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.
911,15,5,Eric Cartman,And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
912,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop! [begins to cry]
913,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[looks at Butters and smiles] Well ma'am, I have some exciting news. [takes his briefcase and opens it, taking out a letter] We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. [Butters claps in approval]"
914,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,[takes the letter and reads it] The what?
915,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?"
916,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,They said it's a boy.
917,15,5,Eric Cartman,[holds out a pen] Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
918,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,How much will he make?
919,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules."
920,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.
921,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-"
922,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,Cain't you change the rules?
923,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? [Butters smiles, reaches for his briefcase, and opens it]"
924,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need. [glances at Stan] Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything. [glances at Stan again] Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? [glances at Stan and waits a bit longer for a reply]"
925,15,5,Stan Marsh,...You sound like Cartmam.
926,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[puts his right hand on his stomach as if punched there] Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!"
927,15,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too."
928,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit! [frightens himself and glances at Stan, then look away] Okay, so, see ya. [goes out the front door and closes it behind him]"
929,15,5,Eric Cartman,It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
930,15,5,Clyde Donovan,We're just having a hard time finding him.
931,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[slams his fists on the table] Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now! [a shot of Slash on the TV on the wall] Now you guys get down there- [the phone rings] Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go! [Craig and Clyde turn around and leave] Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well. [As Clyde and Craig go downstairs, Kyle comes upstairs. Kyle looks pissed as he stops at Cartman's desk] Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too. [softly] Hey Kyle. Have a seat."
932,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,I need to talk to you. [puts a folder down on the desk]
933,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye. [hangs up] How's it goin', man?"
934,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,[opens the folder] In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
935,15,5,Eric Cartman,They can't make money. It's against the rules.
936,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
937,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing."
938,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Gut they're the ones risking injury.
939,15,5,Eric Cartman,"What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!"
940,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"The government could come after us, Cartman."
941,15,5,Eric Cartman,"We're a non-profit company, Kyle."
942,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
943,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. [shows him to the newest addition to the office]"
944,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,A hot tub?!
945,15,5,Eric Cartman,"It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. [Kyle goes up the steps, dips his finger into the liquid, and tastes it]"
946,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Gravy?
947,15,5,Eric Cartman,Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
948,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,No way.
949,15,5,Eric Cartman,"A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime? [pretty soon they're both in the hot tub. A lot of McDonald's french fries sit behind them.] Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine""."
950,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal."
951,15,5,Eric Cartman,It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
952,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,What other companies?
953,15,5,Secretary,"[off-screen] Dean Howland, a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you."
954,15,5,Dean Howland,"A what? Send him in. [the doors open and in walks Cartman, dressed as a Southern gentleman]"
955,15,5,Eric Cartman,[speaking like a Georgia plantation owner] Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
956,15,5,Dean Howland,In the what?
957,15,5,Eric Cartman,"My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself, [opens a humidor and takes out a cigar] I am also in the slave trade. [takes a long whiff of the sealed cigar, then puts it into his inside coat pocket and pats it down] But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets."
958,15,5,Dean Howland,I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.
959,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks over to a picture of the UCB basketball team] You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks."
960,15,5,Dean Howland,Are you referring to our student athletes?
961,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?"
962,15,5,Dean Howland,"Look, there are [catches his breath] good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man."
963,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?"
964,15,5,Dean Howland,"We do [slams his fist on his desk] not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves."
965,15,5,Eric Cartman,"But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight. [clears his throat] Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu. [waits a few seconds, then takes off his hat and softly says] Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves."
966,15,5,Dean Howland,Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!
967,15,5,Eric Cartman,"You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?! [walks towards the entrance and opens the door] This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! [walks out and closes the door]"
968,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies. [Stan just blinks, still half-awake. Kyle turns and looks at him] Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!"
969,15,5,Stan Marsh,[blinks sleepily] McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
970,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! [turns around and walks out]
971,15,5,Eric Cartman,"How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!"
972,15,5,Clyde Donovan,We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
973,15,5,Eric Cartman,How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
974,15,5,Clyde Donovan,We don't know. He's everywhere.
975,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!"
976,15,5,Craig Tucker,"Oh, that's a good idea."
977,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime! [slams the receiver down on the base] Jesus Christ! [Kyle walks in with a stand and some schematics] Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!"
978,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[setting up] Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies."
979,15,5,Eric Cartman,...What?
980,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!"
981,15,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!"
982,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,...What?
983,15,5,Eric Cartman,"This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! [hugs Kyle, who is quite puzzled at Cartman's reaction]"
984,15,5,Postmaster,Let me get this straight. You kids want me to tell you where Slash lives?
985,15,5,Craig Tucker,"Please sir, it's very important."
986,15,5,Postmaster,"Well I'm afraid I can't do that, kids."
987,15,5,Clyde Donovan,But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
988,15,5,Postmaster,"Come on! Kids write to Slash every day, but it all just goes into this big pile over here. [leads them to the pile] The reason I can't tell you where Slash lives is because he don't live nowhere. Don't you ever wonder how Slash can be aaall those places at the same time? It's because he's made up! He-"
989,15,5,Postman,"Don't spoil it for the kids, Marty. It's up to parents to tell their children Slash ain't real. [Craig and Clyde look at each other]"
990,15,5,Roger Donovan,Hullo?
991,15,5,Clyde Donovan,"Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?"
992,15,5,Roger Donovan,Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash.
993,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"[turns around] Oooo well, the day had to come."
994,15,5,Roger Donovan,"Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?"
995,15,5,Clyde Donovan,Slash isn't real.
996,15,5,Craig Tucker,Get out of here.
997,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,"[takes the phone] Clyde, sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters. He's not really a lie, he's like ahh..."
998,15,5,Roger Donovan,[takes the phone back] Er he's like love. People all over the world dress up like Slash and have different names for Slash. The Dutch call him Vunter Slash.
999,15,5,Clyde Donovan,He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
1000,15,5,Roger Donovan,"Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?"
1001,15,5,Betsy MacIntosh,Vunter Slash kapunshka
1002,15,5,Both Parents,Shpielerin manshunshka
1003,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course. [gets no reaction from Stan] Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?"
1004,15,5,Clyde Donovan,[arriving with Craig] You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. [he has a book under his arm]
1005,15,5,Eric Cartman,What?
1006,15,5,Craig Tucker,"Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids."
1007,15,5,Butters Stotch,Slash is make-believe??
1008,15,5,Clyde Donovan,"Here, look for yourself. [plops the book onto the booth table] He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. [a book of his story is shown, with pious images of Slash]"
1009,15,5,Eric Cartman,Vunter Slash?
1010,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1011,15,5,Eric Cartman,"But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?"
1012,15,5,Clyde Donovan,One of our parents.
1013,15,5,Eric Cartman,"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?"
1014,15,5,Clyde Donovan,One of our parents!
1015,15,5,Eric Cartman,Are you fucking serious? [no one speaks for a few seconds]
1016,15,5,Stan Marsh,You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. [leaves the table]
1017,15,5,Eric Cartman,You knew about this??
1018,15,5,Stan Marsh,[stands next to Craig and Clyde] My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. [blinks his eyes and walks away. The others are dumbstruck for several seconds]
1019,15,5,Butters Stotch,Well what the heck do we do now?
1020,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!"
1021,15,5,Mr Peters,"[speaking with the same Southern accent Cartman used earlier] Boys, I want to thank you for bringin' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You've made us a lohhht of monih."
1022,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
1023,15,5,Mr Peters,"[serves himself a drink] Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn't get nothin'. Why, you boys got experience, didn'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves. I'd give you some free video games, but it's against the rules. [smokes a cigar]"
1024,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
1025,15,5,Mr Peters,"Oh, well, fuck 'em. And fuck you too. I piss in your faces. [smokes the cigar again. The boys are dumbstruck for a few seconds]"
1026,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I just can't believe Slash isn't real,"
1027,15,5,Butters Stotch,I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
1028,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!"
1029,15,5,Eric Cartman,"I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me."
1030,15,5,Mr Peters,"[sits in his chair and puts his feet up on the desk] Well boys, this has been real educational and all, but now let's part with that old EA Sports sayin': ""Get the fuck out of my buildin'!"""
1031,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go. [something grabs his attention] No way! [a brand new building is shown: ""South Park Orphanage for Crack Babies""] This is it!"
1032,15,5,Stan Marsh,It's what?
1033,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,"This is it, Stan! [runs across the street and enters the orphanage. Stan trails behind. Several workers are putting up wallpaper] It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh, [sees Ms. Williams] excuse me, what is this place?"
1034,15,5,Ms Williams,Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.
1035,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,But who paid for all this? [Stan catches up and the nurse leaves]
1036,15,5,Stan Marsh,"[tugs at Kyle's coat] Kyle, Kyle! Look. [in a corner sits one of Slash's hats and one of his guitars]"
1037,15,5,Kyle Broflovski,You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
1038,15,5,Stan Marsh,Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
1039,15,5,Child singers,Vunter Slash kapunshka. Shpielerin manshunshka. Het mine gaset rosa. Danka Vunter Slasha
1040,15,5,Eric Cartman,"[pops into view] He is real, you guys. [a constellation of Slash appears among the stars. Cartman winks and drops down from view]"
1041,15,5,Child singers,Vunter Slash kapunshka. Shpielerin manshunshka. Het mine gaset rosa-
1042,15,6,Butters Stotch,Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. [hands him a flyer]
1043,15,6,Cashier,What's this?
1044,15,6,Butters Stotch,An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
1045,15,6,Cashier,Thanks.
1046,15,6,Butters Stotch,"You can count on Postman Butters! [salutes and leaves. As he does so, the cashier makes a ball out of the flyer and tosses it away. Butters doesn't notice, but instead sees a woman coming up and hands her a flyer] Special delivery, ma'am. [sees a man coming up and hands him a flyer. The woman crumples up her flyer and tosses it away] Here you are, sir. [the man balls up and tosses his flyer away] Brand new sushi restaurant in town. [Butters sees another man and hands him a flyer] A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! [the man crumples up his flyer and tosses is away. Butters ends up in front of City Wok and enters. He approaches the counter]"
1047,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,Welcome to Shitty Wok. Can I take a order prease?
1048,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you."
1049,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,[leaves the counter] Wha you talking 'bout?
1050,15,6,Butters Stotch,It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
1051,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"A what? Ret me see that! [grabs the flyer] Oh no, a sushi prace? How come every time a hard-working Chinese man open a business, some shmelly Japanese dog has to come and try invade him?!"
1052,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers."
1053,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,Where is this Japanese-uh toiret bowl?! How far from my Shitty Wok?!
1054,15,6,Butters Stotch,Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
1055,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"What?! Whaaat?! [runs outside and looks both ways. He looks to his left again... There it is: City Sushi, complete with cat statues] What the fuuuck?! [goes inside]"
1056,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Welcome to City Sushi. Can I take er order prease?
1057,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!
1058,15,6,Mr Takiyama,I'm sorry I do not understand your accent. You want a Shitty tuna roll?
1059,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,No I don't want Shitty tuna roll! I want you to go find another shitty town to open your Shitty Sushi prace!
1060,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Why don't you please ujust speak Engrish? Maybe I can understand you!
1061,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"I am speaking Engrish! Why don't you speak a fucking Engrish, you soba eating fuck!"
1062,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Get out or I call porice!
1063,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Come on, kid, you don't wanna eat this-a Shitty Sushi! It give you worms."
1064,15,6,Mr Takiyama,"Better than Shitty Kung Pao Chicken made from cat! [Mr. Kim turns and runs to the counter, jumps over it and lands a blow in Mr. Takiyama's face. They trade blows. Mr. Kim ends with an uppercut]"
1065,15,6,Steven,Hello?
1066,15,6,Sgt Yates,"Sir, does this mailman belong to you?"
1067,15,6,Stephen Stotch,"That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?"
1068,15,6,Sgt Yates,"There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it."
1069,15,6,Stephen Stotch,What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
1070,15,6,Butters Stotch,"But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-"
1071,15,6,Stephen Stotch,Don't talk back to me! [Butters goes inside]
1072,15,6,Sgt Yates,"We'll send a bill for the damages, [the officers turn and leave] but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? [Stephen closes the door]"
1073,15,6,Stephen Stotch,"Go up to your room, now! [Butters goes upstairs]"
1074,15,6,Linda Stotch,What's going on?
1075,15,6,Stephen Stotch,Butters started an Asian turf war!
1076,15,6,Linda Stotch,"Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?"
1077,15,6,Stephen Stotch,"I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda."
1078,15,6,Stephen Stotch,Well Dr. Janus?
1079,15,6,Dr Janus,I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
1080,15,6,Linda Stotch,What?
1081,15,6,Dr Janus,"There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named ""Postman Butters"" and yet another is ""Fireman Butters."" And then there's even ""Inspector Butters"" and uh, ""Professor Chaos""."
1082,15,6,Linda Stotch,Oh my God!
1083,15,6,Dr Janus,"From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds."
1084,15,6,Linda Stotch,"Oh, poor Butters!"
1085,15,6,Stephen Stotch,"Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?"
1086,15,6,Dr Janus,"No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point. [glances at Butters] What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication."
1087,15,6,Field Reporter,"Tom, a brand new sushi place has opened in South Park, adding to our booming Asian district. With the addition of the new Chinese restaurant, townspeople are officially naming this whole Chinatown area ""Little Tokyo."""
1088,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,[comes out of his restaurant and sees the sign] What the fuuuck?! [goes into City Sushi] You see what happen?!
1089,15,6,Mr Takiyama,I told you not to come in here!
1090,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,Now everyone in town think a Chinese and a Japanese are the same fucking thing!
1091,15,6,Mr Takiyama,I don't even know what the fuck you are saying! Uhpupuh putuh peepee!
1092,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Aaah you Japanese racist! [Mr. Kim launches at Mr. Takiyama like he did before, and they trade blows again.]"
1093,15,6,Linda Stotch,"[runs in] Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's butters! [runs off. He follows her out. They reach the backyard] Look!"
1094,15,6,Butters Stotch,"[pretending he's a trucker in his cab] Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!"
1095,15,6,Linda Stotch,Now he thinks he's a truck driver. [cries into Stephen's shoulder]
1096,15,6,Stephen Stotch,Oh God the medication isn't working!
1097,15,6,Butters Stotch,"It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. [Stephen runs up to him]"
1098,15,6,Stephen Stotch,Butters! Butters!! [grabs Butters by the shoulders and shakes him hard] BUTTERRRRS!
1099,15,6,Butters Stotch,Oh hey Dad.
1100,15,6,Stephen Stotch,You're back. You're back-he's back! [Stephen hugs Butters tight and cries.] I love you son!
1101,15,6,Butters Stotch,"I love you too, Dad."
1102,15,6,Stephen Stotch,You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY! [Linda whimpers a bit]
1103,15,6,Mr Takiyama,"Youuu, get out! I told you not to come in here!"
1104,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, whoa, just hold a minute, hold a minute. I come ina peace."
1105,15,6,Mr Takiyama,I don't berieve you!
1106,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Come on, rook! All this fighting, it's just to sirry, you know? Chinese anda Japanese been fighting for so rong. It'sa ridicurous. What we need... is to have a tweaty."
1107,15,6,Mr Takiyama,What is tweaty?
1108,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Nono, we need a tweaty."
1109,15,6,Mr Takiyama,A tweaty?
1110,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"No, not a treaty, a tweaty!"
1111,15,6,Mr Takiyama,"Oh, you mean a treaty?"
1112,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,What the fuck is a tweaty?
1113,15,6,Mr Takiyama,"No no, a treaty."
1114,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"A tweaty? [no response] Rook rook. All these racist people thinka that a Chinese and a Japanese are the same, right? So you and me, we put on a big assembry for all the kids are school, and then everyone understand curtural difference. You know, so they know fried rice isn't from Japan and teriyaki isn't from China."
1115,15,6,Customer,Teriyaki isn't from China?
1116,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"[screams in his face] No, teriyaki isn't froma fucking China!"
1117,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Very well. I will do assembly with you.
1118,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh really? Oh great. [backs away] Okay, I'll meet you tomorrow and we can go over our prans. [turns around] And when you get to that assembry, you gonna get big surprise, you Japanese dog."
1119,15,6,Dr Janus,"Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?"
1120,15,6,Butters Stotch,Sure.
1121,15,6,Dr Janus,What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
1122,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver."
1123,15,6,Dr Janus,"You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?"
1124,15,6,Butters Stotch,Sure.
1125,15,6,Dr Janus,I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
1126,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun."
1127,15,6,Dr Janus,"Inspector Butters, what do you want?"
1128,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Uh, well, to solve mysteries."
1129,15,6,Dr Janus,"And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?"
1130,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!"
1131,15,6,Dr Janus,"He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?"
1132,15,6,Butters Stotch,What? Why would I do that?
1133,15,6,Dr Janus,Who am I speaking to now?
1134,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Me, Butters."
1135,15,6,Dr Janus,"Ah, Butters. You're back."
1136,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Sir, I'm confused."
1137,15,6,Dr Janus,"I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you."
1138,15,6,Butters Stotch,Really?
1139,15,6,Dr Janus,"Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well."
1140,15,6,Alias 1,[a teenaged personality] Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.
1141,15,6,Butters Stotch,Pardon me?
1142,15,6,Alias 1,He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.
1143,15,6,Dr Janus,"Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles."
1144,15,6,Psycho Janus,Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!
1145,15,6,Dr Janus,"Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?"
1146,15,6,Billy,Le's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!
1147,15,6,Psycho Janus,Your soul will bleed for eternity!
1148,15,6,Alias 2,"You don't even know what sexy is, Mr. Harrison."
1149,15,6,Alias 3,[singing] That Big Red freshness lasts right through it!
1150,15,6,Alias 4,"The horned toad says we should go to Mexico. [Butters doesn't know what to make of this doctor, and now he's afraid]"
1151,15,6,Dr Janus,"What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?"
1152,15,6,Butters Stotch,Yes!
1153,15,6,Butters Stotch,"[a recording] This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping."
1154,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal."
1155,15,6,Butters Stotch,"[a recording] Well goodnight for now. [leaves the desk and goes to bed] Goodnight, Butters."
1156,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward. [fast-forwards three hours and then gasps. At normal speed, his bedroom door opens slowly. A second later, Dr. Janus enters] Dr. Janus? [nothing happens for three more hours, so Butters fast-forwards to 3:32 in the morning, when Dr. Janus unzips his pants, pulls out his dick and urinates all over Butters, puts his penis away, zips his pants up, and punches Butters HARD several times before running out of the bedroom. Six seconds later, Butters is fully awake]"
1157,15,6,Butters Stotch,[a recording] Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!
1158,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!"
1159,15,6,Mr Mackey,"Okay, kids, today we have a special assembly, m'kay. Today we're going to learn about ""the diversity of Asian people."" Please welcome Mr. Lu Kim and Mr. Junichi Takiyama. [Walks away. ""Shake that."" A techno song comes on, followed my Mr. Kim and Mr. Takiyama dancing into view]"
1160,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Ni hao ma, South Park Erementary?!"
1161,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Konnichiwa?!
1162,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"How are we arr feering?! [the music stops and the stand back to back] Hey, Mr. Takiyama, did you know that China and Japan are actually uh different countries?"
1163,15,6,Mr Takiyama,"Oh, rearry? [they separate] Hey, that ruhight. If you ook at map, you can see."
1164,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"This whoooore thing is China, and Japan is this riiittle bitty country over here. And that's why the Japanese always try anda take over China!"
1165,15,6,Mr Takiyama,What?!
1166,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,The Japanese planned to kill people in Nanking! The only thing Japanese ruve more than killing people is killing themselves! Suicide rate in Japan sky-high!
1167,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Fuck you!
1168,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"""Oh no, I'm a Japanese and I had a bad day! I think I'm gonna kill myself!"""
1169,15,6,Dr Janus,"Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30."
1170,15,6,Butters Stotch,"[nervous] Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?"
1171,15,6,Dr Janus,Yes. did you catch something?
1172,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face."
1173,15,6,Dr Janus,"[sees the DVD disc and snatches it away, then checks it over] Oh, so you're on to me, huh you little shit?!"
1174,15,6,Butters Stotch,Huh?
1175,15,6,Dr Janus,"What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!"
1176,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-"
1177,15,6,Dr Janus,"Oh come on! You think multiple personality disorder is real?! I've been using that to scam this town for seven years! Now I gotta get out of here, thanks to you! But I'm getting one last heist before I go, and you're gonna help me!"
1178,15,6,Dr Janus,"Get in there! Move it, asshole!"
1179,15,6,Butters Stotch,This is illegal. We could get arrested. [Dr. Janus breaks into some display cases and swipes the jewels into a satchel that Butters is carrying] Oh Jesus!
1180,15,6,Dr Janus,"They're all idiots! The vault! Get to the vault! Come on! Go! Movie it! [puts some welding goggles on Butters while getting a welding torch and firing it up] Get this on and get in that vault! That's where the real good are! [hands the lit torch to Butters]  Torch that door, do you hear me?! I'll kill your parents! I'll kill your friends! I said get that fucking door open!"
1181,15,6,Butters Stotch,"I'm trying, sir! [this changes Dr. Janus' behavior]"
1182,15,6,Dr Janus,"Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!"
1183,15,6,Butters Stotch,What?
1184,15,6,Dr Janus,Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!
1185,15,6,Butters Stotch,"But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh..."
1186,15,6,Dr Janus,"[sighs loudly] Oh boy, you've really done it this time. I know it's not your fault, but I'm sorry. I'm going to have to alert the authorities, pal."
1187,15,6,Dr Janus,"We have to try and understand that he can't help what he's doing, officer. He probably has no memory of it at all."
1188,15,6,Sgt Yates,"Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus."
1189,15,6,Steven,"Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!"
1190,15,6,Sgt Yates,"Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son."
1191,15,6,Steven,"Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much."
1192,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,Herro-o.
1193,15,6,Mr Takiyama,You get the fuck out of my place!
1194,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, hold on, hold on, please! I'ma sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I admit it. I fucked you at the assembly. How about you and me together do an Asian Diversity festival?"
1195,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Get the fuck out before I call police!
1196,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Please, I admitting it, okay?I fucked you at assembly. There's no way around it. It was verrry sneaky. Kind of like Pearl Harbor. Okay? That was a little sneaky too, huh? Pearl Harbor kind of sneaky; I think we can all be a rittle sneaky sometimes, hm? But that sneaky Chinese man? He's gone! Okay? Okay, if we can have Asian Diversity festival, then we no longer have to deal witha ""recial stereotypes."" Prease."
1197,15,6,Mr Takiyama,"Against my better judgment, I will trust you one more time. But this time, you'd better not rub your hands together when you turn around to walk away."
1198,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, see you tomorrow. [turns around and walks away, but stops long enough to rub his hands together] And on that Asian Diversity day you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japanese dog. [continues on his way]"
1199,15,6,Butters Stotch,"That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more- [a bicycle horn stops him, and he holds on to his Professor Chaos mask. He looks over and sees Dr. Janus on a child's tricycle glaring at him] Waaahh! [runs away. As he does, he tosses the Professor Chaos mask back into the cardboard box. Butters runs into the neighborhood park. Dr. Janus chases him down and tackles him there.]"
1200,15,6,Dr Janus,"Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help! [moments later they are seated on a park bench] Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem! [stands up and walks around] The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!"
1201,15,6,Butters Stotch,"[sees a couple walking by] Um, excuse me?"
1202,15,6,Dr Janus,[running around the bench to quickly distract Butters] No no nonono! Don't call out for help! [Dr. Janus opens his sports coat and points to a sidearm] He's got a gun.
1203,15,6,Butters Stotch,Wahh!
1204,15,6,Dr Janus,If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
1205,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you."
1206,15,6,Dr Janus,"No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters."
1207,15,6,Butters Stotch,What??
1208,15,6,Dr Janus,You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
1209,15,6,Butters Stotch,No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
1210,15,6,Dr Janus,You don't understand! For some reason the mean man is getting stronger. You have to help me find out how to stop him! Please! [Butters sighs]
1211,15,6,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in the heart of South Park's Little Tokyo, where the multitude of our town's Chinese are putting on a festival. Both of them have gone all out to celebrate Asian culture. The owner of Shitty Wok has actually paid for what he calls ""a tower of peace."" [the Tower of Peace is shown] to symbolize harmony between the two restaurants"
1212,15,6,A Woman,"Mr. Takiyama, a note for you. [Mr. Takiyama takes the note and reads it]"
1213,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"[voice-over] Konnichiwa, my fine Japanese friend. It's so great that Chinese and Japanese are finarry getting arong. We should take our picture together on top of the Tower of Peace. I'm up there waiting for you now. [Mr. Takiyama looks up, but doesn't see anyone up there] Prease, come meet me on top of the Tower of Peace. It would be rearry nice. [Tuong Lu Kim's image begins to rubs its hands together] Yesss, and when you get to the top of that tower you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japane- Oh, sorry. Anyway, see you on top of tower! [Mr. Takiyama leaves his sample display booth and goes into the tower]"
1214,15,6,Dr Janus,"[as Billy] Dr. Janus sure has a big house, dudn't he? He's planning on hurting people; I just know it!"
1215,15,6,Butters Stotch,"It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this."
1216,15,6,Dr Janus,"This is kinda fun. You're Inspector Butters and I'm your faithful assistant, Dr. Watson!"
1217,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!"
1218,15,6,Dr Janus,"Yeah! [Dr. Janus takes over] Butteers, what are you doing in my house?"
1219,15,6,Butters Stotch,Hah?
1220,15,6,Dr Janus,"Oh dear. It's okay, Butters. You just think you're Inspector Butters right now."
1221,15,6,Butters Stotch,Aw man.
1222,15,6,Dr Janus,"[escorts Butters to the front door] Come on, let's get you home. [Billy takes over] Where are ya gon', Butters?"
1223,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh, come on!"
1224,15,6,Dr Janus,"You aren't leaving here, Inspector! None of you are!"
1225,15,6,Butters Stotch,AAAAAAAAAAA! [runs away. Dr. Janus follows him upstairs] AAAAAAAAAAA!
1226,15,6,Dr Janus,"Butters, come on! Try and come back to us! [Mean Guy takes over] You can't run forever! [pizza delivery man takes over] Excuse me, did someone order a pizza? [Dr. Janus takes over] Yes, that was me, but I'm a little busy at the moment. I'll be right back! [Mean Guy takes over as Butters enters an attic room or a penthouse floor] You'll never turn me in, Inspector Butters! You're dead!"
1227,15,6,Butters Stotch,"Waaaa! [runs to the end of a hall and knocks on the door found there. The door opens and he falls into a room. He looks up and gasps at what he sees: walls covered in newspaper headlines about City Sushi and its chef, and one word written in blood: KILL. Dr. Janus reaches the room and Butters looks over his shoulder. Dr. Janus squints his face and combs over his hair: it's...]"
1228,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"They wanna take over my Shitty Woookk?! Hory crap, what time is it? [checks his watch] Oh no, I'm rate! [turns around and runs downstairs, leaving Butters quite confused]"
1229,15,6,Mr Takiyama,What took you so long?!
1230,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"[takes out a cigarette, clips the end off, and lights it] Yes, I'm afraid my Tower of Peace was a rittle bit of trickery, Mr. Japanese dog. I'm going to put an end to you, and everyone gonna think it's just because you did what Japanese people ruve doing most. ""No, don't do it! Don't kill yourself, prease!"" [jumps on  Mr. Takiyama and grabs him by the throat]"
1231,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Urgh. Fuck you! I'ma not trying to kill myself!
1232,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"""No, don't do it, prease!"" [some sirens are heard below] ""So much to rive for!"" [floodlights quickly find the two chefs, and they stand down]"
1233,15,6,Sgt Yates,[through his bullhorn] This is South Park Police!
1234,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,Porice?! How?!
1235,15,6,Sgt Yates,"We know the truth, Dr. Janus!"
1236,15,6,Mr Takiyama,Thisa Chinise rat trying to kill me!
1237,15,6,Sgt Yates,He's not Chinese! He's white!
1238,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,What the fuck you talkin' about?!
1239,15,6,Sgt Yates,[enunciating] Your name is Dr. Janus!
1240,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"You people crazy! [Billy takes over] Listen to them! It's true! [Mean Guy takes over] Truth hurts, doesn't it, Janus! [Dr. Janus takes over] Who are you people?! Why are you all here?!"
1241,15,6,Mr Takiyama,"How could I ret myself berieve what man was a Chinese?! I have brought shame upon myself! [gets on the balcony and jumps off] Nooooo, this is racist stereotaipuuu! [crashes into his own restaurant, destroying it and dying at the same time]"
1242,15,6,Steven,So you're telling us that Dr. Janus has been the owner of City Wok all this time?
1243,15,6,Sgt Yates,"That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters. [the other officers present give Butters a round of applause.]"
1244,15,6,Butters Stotch,Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
1245,15,6,Steven,"Yes Butters. Thanks to you, maybe Dr. Janus can get back to his real self."
1246,15,6,Sgt Yates,"[walks off] Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again, [stops, then turns around] does the world really need another therapist?"
1247,15,6,Steven,Whattaya mean?
1248,15,6,Sgt Yates,"Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town."
1249,15,6,Desk Officer,Oh yeah.
1250,15,6,Black Officer,Yeah. Let's just let him keep believing he's a Chinese man.
1251,15,6,Sgt Yates,Done!
1252,15,6,Other Officers,Good! Alright! Alright! Yeah!
1253,15,6,Blond Officer,"Detective, he's asking for a blanket. Is that alright?"
1254,15,6,Sgt Yates,Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant. [the officer who conveyed the request carries a blanket back to Tuong Lu Kim's cell. He enters...]
1255,15,6,Tuong Lu Kim,"Thank you. [...and leaves. The guard by the door locks it] ""Oooooo, I hate Japanese people! They try and shut down my Shitty Wok, but they never wiiiiill. They're probably all ratching me, the Japanese. Ret them! I'm not even gonan swat that fryyy. They'll see. And they'll say 'Wow, that Shitty Wok owner. Why, he wouldn't even harm a fryyyyy.'"" [City Wok is shown one more time]"
1256,15,7,Boys,Yay! [Liane sits next to Cartman with a camera of her own]
1257,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright now, open presents! Open presents!"
1258,15,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! [Stan reaches over and opens it]
1259,15,7,Eric Cartman,Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
1260,15,7,Liane Cartman,"[reaches under the table and gives Cartman a gift] Here you go, sweetie."
1261,15,7,Eric Cartman,Yaaaay!
1262,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
1263,15,7,Liane Cartman,"Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too. [in a softer voice] Otherwise, he gets a little upset."
1264,15,7,Eric Cartman,[eagerly opening his own gift] What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
1265,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God...
1266,15,7,Stan Marsh,"[opening his gift] Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters."
1267,15,7,Butters Stotch,I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
1268,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox! [Speed Zone for XBOX 360] D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?"
1269,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Here, this one's from me, Stan."
1270,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh thanks, dude."
1271,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Stan's getting another present, Mom."
1272,15,7,Liane Cartman,"Here you are, muffin. [throws up another gift]"
1273,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Yaaaay! [rips the wrapper off] Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?"
1274,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?"
1275,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah dude!
1276,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"[walks up behind Stan] Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?"
1277,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah they're the best!
1278,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff."
1279,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Mom, I'm 10 years old now."
1280,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy."
1281,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?"
1282,15,7,Randy Marsh,Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
1283,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about."
1284,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Well, do you really think we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?"
1285,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!"
1286,15,7,Randy Marsh,Tween Wave?
1287,15,7,Sharon Marsh,You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
1288,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?"
1289,15,7,Sharon Marsh,This is different!
1290,15,7,Randy Marsh,[waits a few seconds] ...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
1291,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"[stops washing and turns around] It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better."
1292,15,7,Randy Marsh,"[mimicking an elderly man] ""Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."""
1293,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Fine, Randy! [hands him the CD] You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! [goes back to washing dishes]"
1294,15,7,Randy Marsh,"I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. [walks out and towards his den.]"
1295,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Well, it sounds like crap, right?!"
1296,15,7,Randy Marsh,Uh... NO I mean... [looks at Sharon] I like it.
1297,15,7,Sharon Marsh,Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
1298,15,7,Randy Marsh,"No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon."
1299,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!"
1300,15,7,Randy Marsh,"It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! [turns towards the computer. Sharon walks away exasperated. Randy clicks his fingers, but the farts noises keep coming and Randy keeps wincing]"
1301,15,7,Anchorman,"It's called Tween Wave, and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it. A new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012. or ""The Tweens."" Every generation has their music, but many parents say Tween Wave sounds like crap."
1302,15,7,Man 1 and Wife,"It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good."
1303,15,7,Woman 1,This sounds like poo.
1304,15,7,Man 2,[an elderly man] I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.
1305,15,7,Anchorman,Kids however say they don't hear crap at all.
1306,15,7,Kid 1,Parents are dumb.
1307,15,7,Kid 2,They don't get it.
1308,15,7,Kid 1,They don't get it. Parents are stupid.
1309,15,7,Kid 3,Tween Wave is swick.
1310,15,7,Kid 4,"Tweem Wave is super swick and parents don't get it, 'cause their ears are old."
1311,15,7,Kid 5,Parents are dumb.
1312,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music."
1313,15,7,Randy Marsh,"[sitting with the boys] Ugh, that's so unfair!"
1314,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,But that's our music! We like it!
1315,15,7,Randy Marsh,Yeah it's good!
1316,15,7,Sheila Broflovski,What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
1317,15,7,Stan Marsh,We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
1318,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us."
1319,15,7,Gerald Broflovski,"I wanna educate you kids with some real music. [pops in a CD of The Police's ""Synchronicity""] This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. [presses Play and ""Every Breath You Take"" starts up, but instead of lyrics you hear poop sounds]"
1320,15,7,The Boys,Yuck!
1321,15,7,Randy Marsh,What?
1322,15,7,Stan Marsh,That sounds like shit!
1323,15,7,Gerald Broflovski,Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
1324,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Gross!
1325,15,7,Eric Cartman,Turn it off dude!
1326,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you."
1327,15,7,Stan Marsh,"I know, Mom. I love you too."
1328,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff."
1329,15,7,Stan Marsh,"It's okay, Mom. I understand."
1330,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. [Stan turns away and closes his eyes.]"
1331,15,7,Stan Marsh,"'Night. [Sharon turns off the lights and closes the door. A few seconds later, Stan opens his eyes and looks at the door to make sure his mom isn't looking at him. Then he reaches under the mattress and pulls out his iPod] Haha. [listens to some music. Soon some shitty sounds creep in] Ugh. [tries some other tracks, but each one has poop noises in it. He sits up] What the hell? [tries more tracks, but all he hears now is shit]"
1332,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Cartman] Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! [has Cartman listen to his song]"
1333,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, that one's cool. [gets into the rhythm] Yeah, this part's killer. [looks like he's exercising]"
1334,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,[seeing Stan approach] Hey Stan. [hands Cartman his iPod]
1335,15,7,Stan Marsh,Hey dudes.
1336,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite."
1337,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?"
1338,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Sure. [they walk off to a small clearing] What's up?
1339,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle."
1340,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
1341,15,7,Stan Marsh,"No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me."
1342,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,Why? What's it sound like?
1343,15,7,Stan Marsh,It... kind of sounds like shit.
1344,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?"
1345,15,7,Stan Marsh,"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close. [has Kyle listen to a track] You don't hear shit?"
1346,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,No.
1347,15,7,Stan Marsh,That doesn't sound like shit to you?
1348,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor."
1349,15,7,Stan Marsh,"And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me."
1350,15,7,Doctor,"Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?"
1351,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit."
1352,15,7,Doctor,[reads his medical file] This says you had a birthday recently?
1353,15,7,Stan Marsh,I just turned 10.
1354,15,7,Doctor,"Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes."
1355,15,7,Stan Marsh,So this is normal?
1356,15,7,Doctor,"It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear. [plays some music, with lots of fart sounds] What's that sound like to you?"
1357,15,7,Stan Marsh,Sounds like shit.
1358,15,7,Doctor,Aha. Now I'm going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan. [plays a Dylan track. Dylan gets through three syllables before fart sounds replace him.]
1359,15,7,Stan Marsh,Uh that sounds like shit too.
1360,15,7,Doctor,"Wait, this sounds like shit to you?"
1361,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, it's just shit."
1362,15,7,Doctor,"Well that's very strange. [turns off the player] Hm, I'm gonna try somethin' else. [takes two pictures up to Stan] Look at these two pictures. One of them is an ad for Kevin James' new movie The Zookeeper, and the other is a turd in a microwave. Which one is the ad for The Zookeeper?"
1363,15,7,Stan Marsh,"They both look the same. [true enough, except for the turds]"
1364,15,7,Doctor,You don't see any difference in the pictures?
1365,15,7,Stan Marsh,No.
1366,15,7,Doctor,[holds up the picture in his right hand] That is an ad for The Zookeeper and [holds up the picture in his left hand] that is a turd about to be reheated.
1367,15,7,Stan Marsh,They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
1368,15,7,Doctor,"Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called ""being a cynical asshole."""
1369,15,7,Stan Marsh,Oh no.
1370,15,7,Doctor,"Yes. And there's no known cure, I'm afraid. Everything just seems shitty, and everyone starts to seem shitty, and everything they say just starts to [sounds shitty now, and Stan can't believe his ears. Soon, shit comes out of the doctor's mouth and Stan is more horrified]"
1371,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"[walking by] Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?"
1372,15,7,Randy Marsh,Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
1373,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!"
1374,15,7,Randy Marsh,No it doesn't sound like crap to me! [one pooping sound and the headphones are off] Ugh. [gets up and walks around angrily]
1375,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called ""getting older"", Randy. It's okay."
1376,15,7,Randy Marsh,"That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!"
1377,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!"
1378,15,7,Randy Marsh,Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
1379,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake. [presses the play button] A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control! [fart noises, courtesy of his own butt] I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow [more fart noises. A janitor listens in] I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. [more fart noises.]"
1380,15,7,Bar Patron,You suck!
1381,15,7,Randy Marsh,"No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! [more fart noises.]"
1382,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
1383,15,7,Two Farmers/Janitor/Farmer 1 and Farmer 2,"Nah, I'd a heard that."
1384,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
1385,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,What fer?
1386,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style. [sniffs] It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
1387,15,7,Two Farmers/Janitor/Farmer 1 and Farmer 2,You mean that guy that plays the blues and died in an airplane crash?
1388,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
1389,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!"
1390,15,7,Kenny McCormick,(Get him!)
1391,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?"
1392,15,7,Eric Cartman,"He's lying, dude. Hit X"
1393,15,7,Kenny McCormick,"(No, he's telling the truth) [Stan walks in]"
1394,15,7,Stan Marsh,Hey guys.
1395,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?"
1396,15,7,Stan Marsh,He said I have cynicism?
1397,15,7,Eric Cartman,What's that?
1398,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit."
1399,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire."
1400,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?"
1401,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle."
1402,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we got him!"
1403,15,7,Stan Marsh,How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
1404,15,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Hit the X button, Kyle!)"
1405,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna level up to detective!
1406,15,7,Stan Marsh,That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
1407,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?"
1408,15,7,Stan Marsh,"[looking at his chocolate sundae] Aw, dude, this looks like shit."
1409,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,You don't wanna eat it?
1410,15,7,Stan Marsh,"It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit."
1411,15,7,Eric Cartman,Look like ice cream to me.
1412,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?"
1413,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit."
1414,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?"
1415,15,7,Stan Marsh,"What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever."
1416,15,7,Randy Marsh,"City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much [puts the mic to his ass and farts into it]"
1417,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"Lord, I ain't never seen britches take a whoopin' like that."
1418,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
1419,15,7,Randy Marsh,"City bop! City yeah! [more fart sounds, and the song ends] Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks."
1420,15,7,Steamy Nicks,"[sounding a lot like a goat] Thank you, thank you so much. [Randy presses play and a song begins]"
1421,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"Wait now, who's that lady?"
1422,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,That there's Steamy Nicks.
1423,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,"You mean that gal who played for Fleetwood Mac and wrote that song ""Landslide""?"
1424,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,"Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. [sure enough, she does this, and Randy joins her a second later]"
1425,15,7,Randy Marsh,Yoyoyo! [more fart sounds]
1426,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"[enters the bowling alley and heads straight for Randy] Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!"
1427,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
1428,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,Them britches have had enough!
1429,15,7,Waitress,All alone today?
1430,15,7,Stan Marsh,Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
1431,15,7,Waitress,"Well, what can I get you?"
1432,15,7,Stan Marsh,Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
1433,15,7,Waitress,"A little young to be so pessimistic, aren't ya kid?"
1434,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. [just outside, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny walk by, not noticing Stan in the diner. Stan, on the other hand, notices them walk by. He quickly leaves the booth and catches up with them outside, where they're happily talking about something.]"
1435,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,[laughing] I know! That's so hilarious!
1436,15,7,Stan Marsh,I thought you guys were sick! [the other boys don't know what to say]
1437,15,7,Eric Cartman,"...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. [Cartman and Kenny turn and walk away. Stan approaches Kyle]"
1438,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you totally lied to me!"
1439,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-"
1440,15,7,Stan Marsh,Where were you guys going?!
1441,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright dude, we were going to the movies."
1442,15,7,Stan Marsh,Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
1443,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!"""
1444,15,7,Stan Marsh,You guys... don't wanna be around me?
1445,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time."
1446,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you."
1447,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinks about it, then sighs] Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain."
1448,15,7,Stan Marsh,I won't say a word.
1449,15,7,Stan Marsh,Oh shit.
1450,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! [apparently trailers are still playing]"
1451,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh cool, the movie trailers!"
1452,15,7,Announcer,"Adam Sandler is Jack. Adam Sandler is Jill. [Jack and Jill are at a well, and Jill poops on Jack... and they both look like turds]"
1453,15,7,Stan Marsh,Awww God! [squeezes his eyes shut and puts his hand over them]
1454,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!"
1455,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry."
1456,15,7,Announcer,"[a toilet bowl spews out shit] This November, Adam Sandler shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth. [Some eyes, ear, and mouth are shown separately, and poop lands on each of them] It's Adam Sandler in Pbbbbbt, rated Arg for pirates. Fuck you!"
1457,15,7,Eric Cartman,That looks pretty good.
1458,15,7,Stan Marsh,How can you say that looks good?!
1459,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Shhh, you're doing it again!"
1460,15,7,Announcer,"Jim Carrey has a bunch of turds in his apartment. [dancing turds that create turd sounds, at that]"
1461,15,7,Stan Marsh,[shields his eyes from the shit] Ugh.
1462,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Stan, knock it off!"
1463,15,7,Stan Marsh,But it's just crap.
1464,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, they're penguins! Stop it!"
1465,15,7,Announcer,"[shots of Carrey carrying two turds, slipping on another turd, then taking a crap while two turds look on] It's Jim Carrey in Whatever, You'll Pay To Go See It. Fuck you! July 12."
1466,15,7,Announcer,"The President of the United States... is a duck?? [the duck pops up and opens its beak, which issues forth lots of shit] A duck is President and the whole country is goin' to the dogs. [two dogs are shown. One of them has his ass to the camera, and it begins to poop] Or whatever, the President is a dog. [the dog and duck now stand before a U.S. flag] Who cares? Coming June something. [a bunch of poop hits the scene, landing on the dog and duck and spelling out ""JUNE""]"
1467,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh come on, people!"
1468,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! [leaves his seat and walks out. Kenny and Cartman follow suit]"
1469,15,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry."
1470,15,7,Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude."
1471,15,7,Stan Marsh,Me?! Did you see that shit?!
1472,15,7,Stan Marsh,Hang on guys!
1473,15,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! [he and Kenny leave. Kyle stays behind]"
1474,15,7,Stan Marsh,Kyle?
1475,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around] Dude, you've... you've changed."
1476,15,7,Stan Marsh,"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?"
1477,15,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- [poop starts coming out of his mouth and spewing all over the place. He then turns into a huge turd - this is how Stan sees him. The rest of us see him normally. Stan turns and walks away. Kyle turns and walks away in the opposite direction]"
1478,15,7,Randy Marsh,"You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!"
1479,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!"
1480,15,7,Randy Marsh,"I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!"
1481,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"... You're 42 years old, Randy!"
1482,15,7,Randy Marsh,"I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!"
1483,15,7,Sharon Marsh,Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
1484,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,What do you suppose is goin' on in there?
1485,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
1486,15,7,Farmer Friend 2,You... sure you wanna do this?
1487,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,"We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches."
1488,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! [the two men slide a side window up ever so quietly, go in, and sneak upstairs]"
1489,15,7,Randy Marsh,Why can't you ever just support me?!
1490,15,7,Sharon Marsh,Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!
1491,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!"
1492,15,7,Sharon Marsh,WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
1493,15,7,Randy Marsh,"Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! [Sharon reflects on this for a moment and her voice goes soft]"
1494,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous."
1495,15,7,Janitor Farmer 1,"[the two men sneak out the way they came in] Come on britches, we're settin' you free."
1496,15,7,Randy Marsh,I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
1497,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me."
1498,15,7,Randy Marsh,You kind of seem shitty to me too.
1499,15,7,Sharon Marsh,"People get older, Randy. People grow apart."
1500,15,8,Big Harry and Mike,"Oh that's funny, that's real funny. Big Harry and Mike in the Morning talkin' about the new hit movie [poop sounds], a great comedy, starring [poop sounds] and [poop sounds]."

1502,15,8,Big Harry and Mike,Big Harry and Mike in the Morning. We'll talk more about it but let's get to some music. The new Tween Wave band [poop sounds] with their song [poop sounds. The song begins to play. Stan sits up and turns the radio off]
1503,15,8,Announcer,"Coming this fall to Fox/CBS/FX. Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show!  [poop sounds] Dinosaurs! [poop sounds] Lost Humans! [poop sounds] Future, yes! [poop sounds]"
1504,15,8,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, eat your waffles. [Stan gets his knife and fork and cuts into the waffles, then starts eating.]"
1505,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
1506,15,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again! [at this point Stan stops and stands alongside the other boys, but he's still looking at the ground] But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!"
1507,15,8,Kenny McCormick,(Are you serious?!)
1508,15,8,Eric Cartman,Yep!
1509,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!"
1510,15,8,Eric Cartman,Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
1511,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,[sighs gruffly] Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
1512,15,8,Eric Cartman,Wait what?
1513,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,That's what they're talking about on the news!
1514,15,8,Eric Cartman,"Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?"
1515,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yes!
1516,15,8,Eric Cartman,You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
1517,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,You wanna bet? [begins to move off] Let's go ask my Dad right now!
1518,15,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, you're on, Jew! [he and Kenny follow Kyle away. Several seconds later, the bus shows up and Stan gets on. He takes an empty seat and no one sits next to him. He leans against the window, looking very sad]"
1519,15,8,Mr Garrison,"And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. [on the blackboard he had written ""HPV Vaccination Day""]"
1520,15,8,Butters Stotch,Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
1521,15,8,Mr Garrison,"No. Butters, that's not how it works."
1522,15,8,Officer Barbrady,"[offscreen] Mr. Garrison, [now onscreen] these three boys were caught playing hooky."
1523,15,8,Eric Cartman,Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? [Stan is hearing everything as if from a distance]
1524,15,8,Mr Garrison,"Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts."
1525,15,8,Wendy Testaburger,This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
1526,15,8,Butters Stotch,You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
1527,15,8,Eric Cartman,"That's right, it's a butt fungus."
1528,15,8,Butters Stotch,Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
1529,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[in an angry outburst] God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! [looks around glaring at everyone, who look back at him, stunned]"
1530,15,8,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks."
1531,15,8,Stan Marsh,[after a few seconds' silence] I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
1532,15,8,Mr Mackey,"Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?"
1533,15,8,Stan Marsh,"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? [tears start to well up around his eyes]"
1534,15,8,Mr Mackey,"Huh... e-excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay? [stands up, goes to his desk, picks up his phone and starts dialing] Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's."
1535,15,8,Announcer,"This is breaking news, from CNN! Or Fox or, whatever. [The logos for Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC go by] Fuck you."
1536,15,8,Anchor,"The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's Syndrome from school vaccinations [a shot of a syringe and the words ""ASPERGER'S SYNDROME"" appear] has put the government in a tight spot. [a shot of Stan] At a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn."
1537,15,8,Randy Marsh,"It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the ""government"" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a ""mentally incapacitated"" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!"
1538,15,8,Anchor,"In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed ""Stan's Bill,"" putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations."
1539,15,8,Aide 1,"Mr. President, the bill is ready. [the duck, wearing a tailor-made suit, quacks, with shit splattering out of its mouth]"
1540,15,8,Aide 2,"Just sign right here, Mr. President. [the duck quacks again, splattering shit all over the document]"
1541,15,8,Aide 1,"Aaand if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President. [the duck quacks again, splattering shit all over the second document. The parties involved gather for a quick photo opportunity]"
1542,15,8,Anchor,"It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind."
1543,15,8,Eric Cartman,Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
1544,15,8,Nurse Bronski,"Eric, what is it this time?"
1545,15,8,Eric Cartman,[coughing somewhat] Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
1546,15,8,Nurse Bronski,[puts down her notepad and starts examining him] You don't feel warm.
1547,15,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!"
1548,15,8,Nurse Bronski,Can you lay on your stomach?
1549,15,8,Eric Cartman,I-I'll try. I'll try. [lays on his stomach. The nurse sees something under his pants and pulls them back.]
1550,15,8,Nurse Bronski,"What the? [pulls back the briefs and pulls out a wrapped item, then unwraps it] What is this? A hamburger? [indeed, that's what she's holding]"
1551,15,8,Eric Cartman,A what??
1552,15,8,Nurse Bronski,[pulls out another hamburger] Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
1553,15,8,Eric Cartman,Are you serious? How can there be- [sighs] Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
1554,15,8,Nurse Bronski,[pulls out a third hamburger] This doesn't make sense. Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
1555,15,8,Eric Cartman,"What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!"
1556,15,8,Nurse Bronski,Very funny!
1557,15,8,Eric Cartman,Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
1558,15,8,Nurse Bronski,Get out of my office!
1559,15,8,Wendy Testaburger,Hey Kyle? [immediately he knows what she's going to ask] Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
1560,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse."
1561,15,8,Wendy Testaburger,I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
1562,15,8,Boy 1,Those two should just screw and get it over with!
1563,15,8,Boy 2,Yeaahh...
1564,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything."
1565,15,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-"
1566,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[puts his notebook away and closes his locker door] NO. I can't, Wendy. [walking away] All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go. [stops] And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally [makes a fist with his right hand and pounds it into his left palm] positive attitude."
1567,15,8,Eric Cartman,[rounds a corner and walks past Wendy and Kyle] Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
1568,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,What's the matter dude?
1569,15,8,Eric Cartman,[stops and backs up] I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
1570,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one. [reaches for a burger and bites into it. That burger might have been in Cartman's underwear] Mmm. Hm, wow [swallows] This is really good, Cartman."
1571,15,8,Eric Cartman,Really?
1572,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. [a girl walks by] Hey Riley! Try this hamburger. [hands her a burger] Cartman made them himself.
1573,15,8,Riley,[unwraps and eats it] Wow. What is that?
1574,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!"
1575,15,8,Eric Cartman,"Gee, thanks Kyle!"
1576,15,8,Researcher,"The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh. All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits. [they stop next to a seated man who has wrapped his legs behind his neck and is making bubbles with bubble solution and farts] Good morning Mr. Mathers."
1577,15,8,Mr Mathers,"Goodbye, doctor [farts into the blower]"
1578,15,8,Researcher,"[signs and moves on] It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not. [they stop by a man urinating on a wall. Sharon and Stan notice what he's doing] We've got a new patient, Martin. I want you to meet Stan."
1579,15,8,Martin,"[turns around, still urinating, and Stan gets peed on] Nice to meet you."
1580,15,8,Researcher,"[moves on. Martin faces the wall again] Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness. [Stan shakes his head to get the piss off] Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because of its name people think it's a disease to be made fun of. [the researcher opens a door to Room 209, a room of adults who are mentally deficient in one way or another. The adults are doing odd things and making odd sounds. He enters as Sharon and Stan look on a bit worried.] Alright everyone, let's have a seat. [Martin comes in, still urinating, and takes a seat. Stan finds a spot on a sofa and sits there.] Oh uh, we'll be done at about 5 pm, Mrs. Marsh. I'll call if it's any earlier."
1581,15,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. [leaves and closes the door. Everyone sits in silence for a few minutes, then]"
1582,15,8,Researcher,"Alright, are we clear?"
1583,15,8,Neo,We're clear! [everyone begins to move normally and arm themselves. They turn into Matrix characters]
1584,15,8,Morpheus,"Watch that window, Puck! [Neo gets into position by the window] Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged! [the others seal the room] Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!"
1585,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Wait, it's not a real illness?"
1586,15,8,Morpheus,"Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean! [Stan says silent] There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!"
1587,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[gets off the sofa and walks towards the door] Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!"
1588,15,8,Morpheus,"You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?! [Stan stops in his tracks, astounded] Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?"
1589,15,8,Stan Marsh,[turns around] Yeah.
1590,15,8,Neo,So do we. All of us here. We know the truth too.
1591,15,8,Morpheus,"We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?"
1592,15,8,Eric Cartman,"Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful."
1593,15,8,Clyde Donovan,[walking by eating a burger] I just can't believe how yummy these are.
1594,15,8,Eric Cartman,"There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips."
1595,15,8,Molly,Thanks!
1596,15,8,Eric Cartman,"How are we doing on those patties, Jew?"
1597,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"About three minutes, fatass!"
1598,15,8,Eric Cartman,Nice!
1599,15,8,Butters Stotch,"Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more."
1600,15,8,Eric Cartman,It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
1601,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[rushes up in time to stop him] Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?"
1602,15,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers. [Kyle may have noticed, but he doesn't say anything about the burgers stuffed down behind Cartman's ass and legs. Cartman goes into the booth, and moments later comes out with a fresh batch of finished burgers] Alright, these are good to go! [More kids have gathered. Among them are Esther, Heidi, Red, Bill, and Tommy.]"
1603,15,8,Morpheus,"Alright, is he ready to be sent in?"
1604,15,8,Bald Guy,He's ready! Beta levels are normal.
1605,15,8,Stan Marsh,Who are you people?
1606,15,8,Morpheus,"We are the Secret Society of Cynics. [walks off a bit and sighs] Everything looks like shit to you, right? What if I were to tell you... that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?"
1607,15,8,Stan Marsh,Huh?
1608,15,8,Morpheus,The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
1609,15,8,Stan Marsh,Aliens?
1610,15,8,Morpheus,"Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance."
1611,15,8,Neo 2,"Yeah. Everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us!"
1612,15,8,Neo,Yeah!
1613,15,8,Stan Marsh,Because of aliens? [crosses his arms]
1614,15,8,Morpheus,"Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?"
1615,15,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah I'm ready!
1616,15,8,Morpheus,"Let's send him in! [a member of the society prepares a drink for Stan - whiskey on the rocks - and gives it to Morpheus, who hands it over to Stan] Drink this. [Stan hesitates, then takes it and drinks it down. He steps outside and everything is as lovely as it ever was. No signs of shit anywhere.]"
1617,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Ahhhh! [walks around town looking at it with a new sense of wonder, but his walking is off] Oh coool!"
1618,15,8,Adam Sandler,"Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?"
1619,15,8,Jill,I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.
1620,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[laughs rather heartily, looking drunk] Adam Sandler's funny."
1621,15,8,Butters Stotch,"[approaches Kyle] Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. [Kyle leaves to see who it is]"
1622,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan? [Stan is looking away, drunk]"
1623,15,8,Stan Marsh,[sees him] Kyle! [falls into Kyle's arms]
1624,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Stan!"
1625,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[his speech is slurred] Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!"
1626,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, are you alright?"
1627,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit."
1628,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. [smiles. Cartman leans back and looks over from the stand]"
1629,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[squints his eyes] But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! [turns around excitedly]"
1630,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. Have you been drinking?
1631,15,8,Stan Marsh,"You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!"
1632,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh. [Cartman takes a quick order, then looks back at Stan and Kyle] Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now."
1633,15,8,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? [Cartman walks over, drying his hands off in the process]"
1634,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
1635,15,8,Eric Cartman,"Everything alright here, Kyle?"
1636,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's fine."
1637,15,8,Eric Cartman,We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
1638,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there."
1639,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!"
1640,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn."
1641,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[a couple of seconds of silence, then Stan gives him the finger.] Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit! [Kyle sighs and walks back to the burger stand] ...Kyle, I love you. [Kyle reappears a few seconds later, and Stan gives him the finger again.] You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you! [Kyle turns heel and walks back towards the stand] ...I love you. [Kyle does not return]"
1642,15,8,Big Harry and Mike,"Big Harry and Mike in the Morning and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of [poop sounds], we're breakin' it down."
1643,15,8,"Entertainers
Adam Sandler
Jill
Aide 1
Aide 2
Anchor
Big Harry and Mike","Oh Big Harry, when the [poop sounds] ran into the [poop sounds]- [Stan sits up, then scoots towards the alarm]"
1644,15,8,Big Harry and Mike,"Nonono, no! How about when [poop sounds. Stan turns off the alarm, then hops off the bed.]."
1645,15,8,Morpheus,He's back! [the other members jump up and gather around Stan] Did you see the illusionary world again?
1646,15,8,Neo,How does it feel to be back in the Matrix?
1647,15,8,Stan Marsh,I feel like total shit.
1648,15,8,Bald Guy,It's okay. That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
1649,15,8,Morpheus,"Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now."
1650,15,8,Stan Marsh,The rock creatures?
1651,15,8,Morpheus,"Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you."
1652,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any..."
1653,15,8,Neo,"He's gonna pop! [Stan vomits and falls over on his face. He passes out. The other members gather around him even closer. Fade to black. Some time later, Stan's eyes blink.]"
1654,15,8,Morpheus,"Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left."
1655,15,8,Neo,You're pushin' him too hard!
1656,15,8,Stan Marsh,Ugh God.
1657,15,8,Morpheus,"Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in! [a pair of doors in the ceiling slide open and a giant bottle of Jameson Irish Whiskey drops down, being held in place by a robotic arm. A nippled syringe pulls forward and enters Stan's mouth and begins pumping him full of whiskey. Stan can only look down helplessly]"
1658,15,8,Figure 1,"We all know why we are here. There's a rebellion in our midst and it must be SQUASHED OUT! [it's a McDonald's executive] We have to put an end, to Cartman Burgers. [the other executives seen are from KFC, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Subway, Chick-fil-A, and Taco Bell.]"
1659,15,8,Other Execs,"Yes, yes, but what do we do?"
1660,15,8,KFC Exec,At KFC we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
1661,15,8,Pizza Hut Exec,It's worse at Pizza Hut. Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
1662,15,8,McDonald s Exec,"[gets up from his chair and paces a bit] What makes them so good? For whatever reason, these Cartman Burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants!"
1663,15,8,Taco Bell Exec,"[walks up to a chart and then turns to show the other execs.] There lies the secret. [eight restaurants are shown on the chart, including City Wok. An arrow from each of the restaurants points towards a Cartman Burger in the middle] It's the chemical compounds from all our flavors. Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC, all somehow infused into one burger."
1664,15,8,KFC Exec,"[walks up to a whiteboard on which a chemical compound from each restaurant is shown being mixed in a beaker and the combined solution being distilled into the Cartman Burger] It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food, breaking them down into some kind of... gas. And them somehow... infusing that gas into his hamburger. What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?"
1665,15,8,Pizza Hut Exec,It would have to be some sort of super Dutch oven.
1666,15,8,Burger King Exec,"But a Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen. [Behind them, Stan breaks into the boardroom through the window]"
1667,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[falls onto the floor] Aughah. [gets up and starts firing indiscriminately, moaning all the while. He falls on his back, fires off a few more shots, turns his head to his left side, and throws up. He passes out]"
1668,15,8,McDonald s Exec,"Hey! Wake up. Come on now, wake up! [looks at the Taco Bell Exec] Use the smelling salts! [the Taco Bell Exec puts an enchirito under Stan's nose]"
1669,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[sniffs and then smacks his lips a bit, finally waking up] ...Enchirito?"
1670,15,8,McDonald s Exec,You know the secret?
1671,15,8,Stan Marsh,What? You guys are aliens?
1672,15,8,McDonald s Exec,Stop playing with us! What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?!
1673,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't know!"
1674,15,8,Taco Bell Exec,He's lying! [reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a picture of Kyle] You see this kid in the picture? This guy is his best friend.
1675,15,8,McDonald s Exec,Ah ha!
1676,15,8,Stan Marsh,I'm not friends with him.
1677,15,8,Taco Bell Exec,They've been through everything together. Inseparable.
1678,15,8,Stan Marsh,"No, no, we don't hang out anymore."
1679,15,8,McDonald s Exec,"Oho right, like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that?"
1680,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!"
1681,15,8,McDonald s Exec,Oh sure! Anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good! Now stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers is so delicious!
1682,15,8,Stan Marsh,I don't know!
1683,15,8,McDonald s Exec,"Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way."
1684,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"There, ten mediums and five medium-rares."
1685,15,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer."
1686,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Next please. [smiles, but quickly frowns upon seeing the next customer] Oh, hey."
1687,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger."
1688,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing?
1689,15,8,Stan Marsh,How do you guys make them so yummy?
1690,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
1691,15,8,McDonald s Exec,[hiding in some bushes with the other execs] You'd BETTER get him to tell you or you're getting shot in the back of the head! [The Chick-fil-A exec has a sniper's gun trained on Stan's head. Stan is wearing an ear piece] You got that?!
1692,15,8,Stan Marsh,"[panicking, but with great restraint] Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger"
1693,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
1694,15,8,Stan Marsh,"No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me."
1695,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[rolls his eyes] Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!"
1696,15,8,McDonald s Exec,"Oh, right. Like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness!"
1697,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!"
1698,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You said ""fuck you"" to my face, Stan."
1699,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying."
1700,15,8,McDonald s Exec,"Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back."
1701,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us."
1702,15,8,McDonald s Exec,"[comes out of the bushes and goes to the stand] Goddamnit this is getting us nowhere! [the other execs follow him onto the sidewalk] Everyone get back! Do you wanna play hardball?! That's fine! [the Chick-fil-A exec wields his gun and the kids scream and scatter. The McDonald's exec goes to the Secret Last Process Booth] All right, let's see this mighty machine once and for all! [before he can see anything, he's gunned down by the drunken research center/Matrix members, who then start firing away indiscriminately with their semi-automatics]"
1703,15,8,Morpheus,"[dispatching the Taco Bell exec] You vampire sons of bitches! [the Chick-fil-A, Burger King and Subway execs go down, then the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell execs]"
1704,15,8,Neo,Haha! [accidentally shoots himself in the head and goes down]
1705,15,8,Morpheus,"Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!"
1706,15,8,Stan Marsh,Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
1707,15,8,Mr Mathers,"Uh oh, looks like the serum is wearing off! [whips out a glass and a bottle of whiskey] Here, you'd better take some more! [pours the whiskey in the glass]"
1708,15,8,Stan Marsh,"No, I'm done with that! [slaps it away from the member's hand]"
1709,15,8,Morpheus,"But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!"
1710,15,8,Stan Marsh,"I don't want everything to go back to the way it was! [suddenly calm] I, I don't. [he steps over the broken bottle, leaves and joins the other kids, who have returned] You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town. [approaches one boy] Maybe this kid will become my new best friend. [then another] Or maybe this kid will."
1711,15,8,Douglas,Wow. [smiles]
1712,15,8,Stan Marsh,"Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. [a horn and the sound of wheels stopping are heard]"
1713,15,8,Randy Marsh,"[in the U-Haul truck] Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!"
1714,15,8,Stan Marsh,[his face drops] What?
1715,15,8,Randy Marsh,"We worked it out, pal. Surprise!"
1716,15,8,Stan Marsh,"No, dad, no. No, please!"
1717,15,8,Sharon Marsh,"[somber and unsure] We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know..."
1718,15,8,Stan Marsh,"No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn."
1719,15,8,Sharon Marsh,"People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know."
1720,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!"

1727,15,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters with Cartman and Kenny] Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!"
1728,15,8,Eric Cartman,The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! [they walk back out and away.]
1729,15,8,Stan Marsh,"...K, coming. [hops out of bed and puts on his coat, going through the motions. He walks out to join the boys, but a few seconds later he returns to open a drawer, pull out a bottle of whiskey, opens it, takes a swig of it, closes it, and puts it back in the drawer. He doesn't bother to put on his shoes. He closes the drawer and heads back into the hall]"
1730,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready. [spits something out, wipes his lips clean with the back of his shirt sleeve, and returns to patrolling the border] There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!"
1731,15,9,Liane Cartman,"[walking out] Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?"
1732,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah! [turns to the boys on the ground - Clyde, Craig, and Timmy] All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!"
1733,15,9,The other four,Yeehaw! [Timmy stays silent]
1734,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!"
1735,15,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader."
1736,15,9,Butters Stotch,"[saddened] Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?"
1737,15,9,Stan Marsh,"You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco."
1738,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them."
1739,15,9,Eric Cartman,[robot voice] Scanning for Mexicans. [more sound effects] Oh! [He spots Kyle coming out of the woods] We've got a Mexican! [Clyde and Craig take up posts]
1740,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
1741,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[to the other boys] He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid. [to Kyle] Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!"
1742,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,Better than being a fat-ass Texan!
1743,15,9,Eric Cartman,Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
1744,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!"
1745,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew! [Stan sneaks in past a cardboard box labelled ""Christmas Ornaments""] Let's just see you try and-!"
1746,15,9,Stan Marsh,Base! [the others turn to see Stan in their midst]
1747,15,9,Eric Cartman,Clyde?! [descends from his perch atop the border and goes to Clyde] The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
1748,15,9,Clyde Donovan,I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
1749,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit! [Token appears at the other end of the border and hops over] If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!"
1750,15,9,Token Black,Base!
1751,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude!! [walks over to Craig] How did he get past the fence, Craig?!"
1752,15,9,Craig Tucker,I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
1753,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! [Jimmy walks by in the foreground]"
1754,15,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Eh, b-base."
1755,15,9,Eric Cartman,Oh God! [throws down his hat]
1756,15,9,Stan Marsh,"So, so then, so then the pope says, ""Maybe you should go check the toilet."" [most of the other boys laugh]"
1757,15,9,Craig Tucker,"Hey. Hey, I got one. [the other get quiet] Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?"
1758,15,9,Token Black,Why?
1759,15,9,Craig Tucker,'Cause they're ugly and they stink. [most of the other boys laugh]
1760,15,9,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game."
1761,15,9,Eric Cartman,I'm not pouting! I've just heard all these jokes before!
1762,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
1763,15,9,Eric Cartman,"At least I have an asshole, Kyle! [the boys laugh]"
1764,15,9,Butters Stotch,"[thinking to himself] Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: ""Go that way."" How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans."
1765,15,9,Butters Stotch,"[wanders around] Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border! [walks further away, and finds a road. He walks along the shoulder and shivers as he sings] Lalala, lalala, Work Meheecan Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Meheecan Work. [A couple in a car drive up behind him]"
1766,15,9,Woman,"Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse."
1767,15,9,Elderly Man,It sure is. I-I can barely see. [Butters turns around and the woman suddenly sees him]
1768,15,9,Woman,"Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! [the man loses control and hits Butters, who simply tumbles off the car and onto the shoulder, face down. The couple stops the car and goes to check on Butters. The wife turns him over]"
1769,15,9,Elderly Man,"Oh my God, are you alright?"
1770,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. M-mis amigos, my a-, my amigos are waiting."
1771,15,9,Elderly Man,Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.
1772,15,9,Butters Stotch,"I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans."
1773,15,9,Woman,"[showing him around the room] Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay. [kneels before him] Do you understand?"
1774,15,9,Elderly Man,"Darling, I don't know if we can keep him."
1775,15,9,Woman,What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?! [to Butters] Win-dow. Wiinnn-dow.
1776,15,9,Elderly Man,"Yep, window."
1777,15,9,Woman,"[pleased] Bueno! [to her husband] He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico! [to Butters] Window. Windooow. [gives him a bottle of] Win-dex. Wiiin-dex, Mantequilla. Paper towel. [squirts some Windex onto the towel and takes Butters to the window] Sí, sí Mantequilla [shows Butters how to clean the window, then leaves him to continue doing it himself]"
1778,15,9,Elderly Man,"Auhp, be sure to get the edges."
1779,15,9,Woman,"Oh darling, it's wonderful."
1780,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[talking in his sleep] No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got... [wakes up] Butters! [gets up, then tries to get the others up] Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!"
1781,15,9,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about?
1782,15,9,Eric Cartman,Where is Butters?
1783,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,[after a few seconds] He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
1784,15,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I think he was? Wait."
1785,15,9,Craig Tucker,Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
1786,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,Butters?
1787,15,9,Stan Marsh,Butters!
1788,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[hugs himself] Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead."
1789,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[puts on his ranger hat, now speaking in his Texan voice] All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through! [walks towards the woods, but stops long enough to tell Kyle] You haven't won yet! [smiles evilly and moves on] Game on!"
1790,15,9,Craig Tucker,Game on!
1791,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Wugh, game on. [puts on his mustache]"
1792,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Work, Mexican, Work. [hums some more] Work, Mexican, Work"
1793,15,9,Woman,"[arrives at the kitchen entrance] Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. [leaves. Butters follows her out]"
1794,15,9,Elderly Man,Surprise! We've scraped some money together and got you something. [Butters grins]
1795,15,9,Woman,"It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente."
1796,15,9,Butters Stotch,Wow! A present just for me? [starts to unwrap it]
1797,15,9,Woman,Oh he's such a happy little Mexican. [Butters finishes unwrapping it only to see a gas-powered leaf blower designed to be worn on the back]
1798,15,9,Elderly Man,"How do you like that, Mantequilla? Your very own leaf blower! Hahah, I have no idea how it works, but I'm sure you do, huh. Say, how'd you like to go in the back yard and play? [moments later, Butters is in the back yard using the power blower to blow some leaves around. The couple watch him from a table with umbrella providing shade]"
1799,15,9,Woman,"Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy."
1800,15,9,Elderly Man,"Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you."
1801,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Ah, sí señor."
1802,15,9,Woman,Oh he's so adorable.
1803,15,9,Backup Singers,"Work, Mexican, work."
1804,15,9,Butters Stotch,"All week long, bossman say"

1812,15,9,Both,lot in life.
1813,15,9,Butters Stotch,While people play in the sun all day
1814,15,9,Both,"Work, Mexican, work."
1815,15,9,Elderly Man,"Honey? Honey, what's wrong? [she looks up to see him]"
1816,15,9,Woman,"It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the windows, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said ""I need to go home."" I tried telling him ""your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!"" But I don't think he feels it."
1817,15,9,Elderly Man,"Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-"
1818,15,9,Woman,"No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!"
1819,15,9,Brian Whipple,"Come on, honey. [they walk back to the car]"
1820,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey, where are you going?"
1821,15,9,Woman,[turns around] No! Mantequilla bad! Go now!
1822,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?"
1823,15,9,Woman,"No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! [they reach the car, get in, and drive off. The woman is still weeping]"
1824,15,9,Butters Stotch,"So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! [the workers all stop in shock and look at him, a utensil can be heard hitting the floor]"
1825,15,9,Worker 1,Mantequilla?
1826,15,9,Worker 2,Mantequilla?
1827,15,9,Worker 1,"¡Yo he escuchado de este niño! ¡He visto anuncios de el por donde quiera! [""I've HEARD of this kids! I've seen POSTERS and BILLBOARDS of him everywhere!""]"
1828,15,9,Worker 3,"Sí. Es famoso! [""Yeah. He's FAMOUS!""]"
1829,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!"
1830,15,9,Worker 1,"¿Un niño gringo que quiere ses mexicano? [""A WHITE American kid who wants to be Mexican?""]"
1831,15,9,Worker 3,"Ay, tiempos han cambiado. [""Wow, times are really changing""]"
1832,15,9,Worker 1,"No... no. ¿Saben qué? Mantequilla tiene derecho. ¿Por qué venimos a este país? ¡Vale madre aquí, 'mano! [""No... no, you know what? Mantequilla is RIGHT! Why did we even come to this country? It SUCKS HERE, MAN!""]"
1833,15,9,Butters Stotch,Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
1834,15,9,Worker 1,"Debemos escuchar a este niño. ¡Mexico es mucho mejor que esto! [""We should listen to this kid. Mexico is better than this!""]"
1835,15,9,Butters Stotch,"All my amigos are there, waitin' for me."
1836,15,9,Worker 1,"Todos mis amigos están allí también.. [""All my amigos are back there too.""]"
1837,15,9,Worker 2,"¡A la chingada con esto! ¡Vamonos! [""Come on, screw this! Let's go!""]"
1838,15,9,Worker 3,"Sí, ¡vamonos a la chingada!"
1839,15,9,Butters Stotch,Viva la Meheeco!
1840,15,9,Doctor,"Alright, let's get him into ER."
1841,15,9,Elderly Man,Careful w'my foot! [a car stops and a man whistles]
1842,15,9,Worker 2,"¡Oye Yimenez! ¡Nos vamos a regresar, hombre! [""Hey Yimenez!!! We're going back, man!""]"
1843,15,9,Nurse Yimenez,"¿Qué? [""What?""]"
1844,15,9,Worker 2,"¡Este lugar es una mierda! ¡Nos regresamos a Mexico![""This place sucks! We're going back to Mexico!""]"
1845,15,9,Butters Stotch,We're crossin' the border!
1846,15,9,Nurse Yimenez,"¡Jose! ¡Martinez! Nos vamos para atras para Mexico! [""We're going back to Mexico!"" The nurses and other Hispanic workers pour out of the hospital]"
1847,15,9,Butters Stotch,Olé!
1848,15,9,Border Officer 1,Pretty quiet out there.
1849,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Yeah, a bit too quiet if you ask me. Gimme those! [takes the binoculars and looks through them]"
1850,15,9,Border Officer 1,"Just seems like Mexicans don't try to cross into the US as much as they used to, you know?"
1851,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Noo, they're out there, Charlie. Plottin' their next move. They'll do anything they can to get into the Land of Opportunity. [lowers the binoculars. The first illegals appear on the US side of the border and head towards the fence] And as long as this country offers everyone a better life, there's gonna be people clamorin' to get it. It's the curse of success, Charlie. [more aliens appear as the first ones hop over the fence] A great and wealthy nation will always be plagued [raises the binoculars and looks through them again] by the needy tryin' to-what the hell? [sees the Mexicans running into Mexico. The other guard notices too]"
1852,15,9,Officer Charlie,"[scratches his head] Uhh, sir? Aren't them Mexicans runnin' into Mexico?"
1853,15,9,Border Officer 2,[lowers his binoculars] That don't make sense.
1854,15,9,Officer Charlie,[shouting to the returning illegals] You're going the wrong way!
1855,15,9,Anchorman Chris,"You've heard of Mexican salsa, but Mexican pride? The phenomenon is called ""Orgullo de Mantequilla,"" where Mexicans are realizing it actually is starting to suck more here in the US. The borders are being flooded with Latin Americans trying to get back to their own countries. [Randy and Sharon are on the sofa watching the news]"
1856,15,9,Randy Marsh,"Well, I think it's good. [stands up and puts on his blazer, then walks to the front door] If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy. [opens the door and looks outside. Huge piles of leaves have been left on his front yard] NOOOOOO! [Audio clip is Darth Vader's voice from Star Wars Ep. III]"
1857,15,9,Anchorman Chris,"But just what has sparked the Mexican desire to live... in Mexico? Joining us now is economist Mark Geiger, and Mark, we've heard of Mexican ice cream, but Mexican patriotism?"
1858,15,9,Mr Geiger,"Yes, it's a very odd phenomenon, Chris. Ih it just- [the front door opens and it's Stan and Kyle, who are pretty miffed for obvious reasons]"
1859,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell is this?! [he's holding a poster Cartman designed: ""Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol. Permission to shoot on sight.""]"
1860,15,9,Eric Cartman,"You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up."
1861,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"""Wanted by the U.S. Border Patrol""?! ""Permission to shoot on sight""?!"
1862,15,9,Eric Cartman,"You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too."
1863,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
1864,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?[The news come back on, with Cartman glancing at his TV, with Kyle also staring, as Stan continues glaring at Cartman]"
1865,15,9,Anchorman Chris,Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
1866,15,9,Eric Cartman,Oh dude. Sweet.
1867,15,9,Crowd,¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap] ¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap] ¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap]
1868,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh uh, I'm sorry, [opens his arms wide] I don't really-"
1869,15,9,Crowd,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [he lowers his arms and the crowd quiets down. He raises them up and] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [he raises his right arm] ¡Oy! [he lowers his arm and raises it a little] ¡Oy! [now raises his left arm] ¡Orgullo! [opens his arms wide] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [the crowd members raise their arms and some begin to toss their hats in the air]
1870,15,9,Butters Stotch,Wow.
1871,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Welcome to the US Border Patrol. You volunteers are the key to keepin' this country safe and prosperous. [begins to walk back and forth] Every day, more and more Mexicans are tryin' to get past this fence and go back to their homes in Mexico. As border patrol officers our duty is to stop Mexicans from crossin' the border. We don't need to worry about the semantics of which direction they're going, we're just supposed to stop them! [pounds his left fist into his right hand] Marcus?"
1872,15,9,"Border Patrol Officers
Officer Charlie
Officer Marcus",The standard-issue border patrol weapon is the P-29 stun baton. [begins handing a baton to each volunteer] It carries a 4000 watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law.

Officer Marcus","The baton is non-lethal, but powerful e-"
1875,15,9,Border Officer 3,Hey! We got some! Mexicans at 2 o'clock! [hands his binoculars over to Officer 2]
1876,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Let's get ready, recruits! Must be a couple dozen of them! [Cartman takes out his own binoculars and begins scanning and providing his own sound effects] This is the US Border Patrol! Stop where you are! Turn around and get back to work!"
1877,15,9,"Border Patrol Officers
Officer Charlie
Officer Marcus","There's too many of 'em! We're gonna need backup! [Cartman goes to a nearby water truck and opens a spigot, which releases water and creates a large puddle. The Mexicans run into the puddle and stand there. Cartman tosses his baton into the puddle, electrocuting the Mexicans.]"
1878,15,9,Border Officer 2,"You're pretty good at stoppin' Mexicans, son. What's your name?"
1879,15,9,Eric Cartman,Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
1880,15,9,Narrator,"Dedicated. Patriotic. Tireless. These are the men and women of the US Border Patrol. They work around the clock protecting America's prosperity. They are the front line in making sure Mexicans stay here and work. The border patrol is uncompromising, diligent, and kewl. They will defend, arrest, and most importantly, let the Mexicans know that they are way better off here in the United States."

1882,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Thanks everyone. [hops onto the table] It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos. [gets sad] It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick."
1883,15,9,President Calder n,"Mantequilla, tu tienes que hacer una decisión. Los Estados Unidos están de baja, y claro, México pronto será el mejor lugar. Pero como Mexicanos, nosotros sabemos que nada es más importante que la famlia, y amistades. Estás invitado a vivir con nosotros, Mantequilla, pero tienes que seguir tu corazón. ¿Quieres quedarte aquí con nosotros, o quieres estar con tus amigos? [""Mantequilla, you have a decision to make. The United States is on the decline, and clearly, Mexico will quickly become the better place to be. But as we Mexicans know, nothing is more important than FAMILY and FRIENDS. You are welcome to live with us, Mantequilla, but you must follow your heart. Do you want to stay here with us, or do you want to go back to your amigos?""]"
1884,15,9,Butters Stotch,[aside to the Mexican sitting at the table with him] ...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
1885,15,9,Eric Cartman,"[robot voice] No Mexicans detected. [normally] Huh, nothing."
1886,15,9,Border Officer 4,"[Richards] Let's face it: they've just about all gotten back across. No matter how hard we tried, the Mexicans all got across the border."
1887,15,9,Border Officer 2,"When we asked Obama to stop illegal immigrants, we didn't mean to make the US so shitty they wouldn't wanna come anymore."
1888,15,9,"Border Patrol Officers
Officer Charlie
Officer Marcus","[along in the lookout tower, as bored as the others, he suddenly sees something, sits up, and rushes to tell the others.] Hey! Hey wait a minute! [whips out his binoculars and gets a better look.] It's a Mexican! [It's Mantequilla] I think he wants to come back in! [Officer 2 climbs the ladder and gets a better look]"
1889,15,9,Border Officer 2,"Oh my God it is! [puts down the binoculars and happily waves his hat at Butters] Hey! Hey! Come on in! [bangs at the tower and whistles] Come on! Come on! Come on, it's okay! [Butters draws closer, smiling. guard 2 addressed the other officers and volunteers] The fuck are you doing?! Get that gate open! [an officer and a volunteer happily oblige. The other officers and volunteers are smiling too]"
1890,15,9,Border Officer 5,"Come on, buddy!"
1891,15,9,Other Officers,"Come on now, come on! You've got it. [Cartman gets up on the tower and uses his own binoculars]"
1892,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute, isn't that..."
1893,15,9,Butters Stotch,[looking back at him] Game on!
1894,15,9,Eric Cartman,[squints his eyes] Oh no you don't! [takes Officer 2's sidearm and fires at Butters.]
1895,15,9,Butters Stotch,[dodging the bullets] AAAH!
1896,15,9,Border Officer 2,[takes his weapon back] Fuck are you doin'?!
1897,15,9,Eric Cartman,"That asshole is not getting across my border! [Butters either fails to see the open gate, or it was closed while Cartman was firing at him, because he starts climbing the fence. Cartman quickly gets down to intercept him, but decides that electrocuting the fence would get Butters off it, and it works]"
1898,15,9,Butters Stotch,AAAAH! [falls and gets up] I'll get over! [runs farther away from the tower]
1899,15,9,Eric Cartman,[gives chase] No you won't Butters!
1900,15,9,Butters Stotch,"[sees a gray burro and jumps up on him] Giddy up! [gallops away. Cartman gets on a pale gray burro and whistles, and gallops after Butters]"
1901,15,9,Mexican Commentator,"Un otro shoto de Mantequilla. Y Manteque-ah. ¡Oh! ¡Una arma! Una arma del El Niño Gordo! [""Another shot of Mantequilla! And Mantequi-ah. Oh! A firearm! The fat kid's firearm!"" Apparently Cartman was firing at Butters]"
1902,15,9,Mexicans,Ohhh!
1903,15,9,Eric Cartman,Ey!
1904,15,9,Mexican Commentator,"Mantequilla ayudar ¡1a Border Patrol! [""The Border Patrol is coming to Mantequilla's aid!"" The Mexicans cheer]"
1905,15,9,Eric Cartman,"¡Respeto mi autóridad! [""Respect mah authoritah!"" Again, Cartman is fired upon, and his boat begins to sink. This time, the border patrol is in a helicopter firing away]"
1906,15,9,Mexican Commentator,"Border Patrol pegaron ¡El Cero Gordo! [""The border patrol hit the Fat Zero!"" Next, Cartman is on an ATV and stops to look for Butters]"
1907,15,9,Eric Cartman,"Where the fuck did he go?! [in the background, Butters can be seen riding by on his burro. Cartman sees him and gives chase. Just before Cartman reaches him, Butters blinks. Cartman jumps off his ATV and tackles Butters off his burro, and they both end up on the desert ground, with Cartman on top] Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose! [Butters apparently collapses] The fuck is this?! [instead of seeing the real Butters, Cartman sees a life-size piñata of him. The head separates from the body and candy falls out] No. NO! [Butters is climbing the fence]"
1908,15,9,Butters Stotch,[taunting] Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!
1909,15,9,Eric Cartman,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! [Butters goes over the border fence and jumps down]
1910,15,9,Butters Stotch,Base! [dances around with his arms outstretched]
1911,15,9,Mexicans,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [Butters gets on his knees and slides into a pose]
1912,15,9,Mexican Commentator,"El mirito, vinto! [the Mexicans celebrate. The border patrol celebrates as well, and Butters dances, the ""Mexican Hat Dance"" starts playing]"
1913,15,9,Butters Stotch,"So then, so then the fireman says ""That won't even fit in my scrotum!"" [the boys laugh again]"
1914,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[noticing Cartman] Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!"
1915,15,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!"
1916,15,9,Butters Stotch,"Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!"
1917,15,9,Stan Marsh,"Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks."
1918,15,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. [everyone falls silent. Butters stands up on his chair and raises his arms slowly]"
1919,15,9,Mexicans,"[responding to his gesture] ¡Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... [A baby responds to it, as do three Mexican fisherman out at sea. Craig and Kyle look all around, and then at Butters. Butters thrusts his right arm out twice.] ¡Oy! ¡Oy! [Butters thrusts his left arm out once] ¡Orgullo! [raises both arms again] ¡Maaantequilla! [now all his friends are looking at him]"
1920,15,9,Eric Cartman,[Sighs gruffly and rolls his eyes] A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
1921,15,10,Eric Cartman,"YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys! [runs up to Butters, Kenny, Stan, and Kyle] You're never gonna guess what! [stands among them] Seriously you guys, guess what??"
1922,15,10,Stan Marsh,What?
1923,15,10,Eric Cartman,"You guys, you know Pete Melman? [no one answers] Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?"
1924,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,The blond kid?
1925,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!"
1926,15,10,Stan Marsh,What about him?
1927,15,10,Eric Cartman,"He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! [begins to cackle]"
1928,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,[angry] How do you know?!
1929,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!"
1930,15,10,Butters Stotch,Eavesdropper?
1931,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
1932,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper? [whips out an iPhone and starts looking for the Eavesdropper article]  It's a Web site about all the students in the school! [The web site screams ""Exclusive! Pete Melman Craps Pants At School!"" at you. Part of the page has a picture of Pete on there, with a 'play' button to play a recording]"
1933,15,10,Clyde Donovan,"[appears at the far end of the hallway] Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! [runs off to tell others]"
1934,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys! [gets back to his phone] Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom. [touches the 'play' button] Just listen, listen listen."
1935,15,10,Nurse Bronski,"Hello Mrs. Melman, this is the school nurse. I'm afraid your son has had a little accident. [Cartman snickers quietly]"
1936,15,10,Mrs Melman,"Oh no, what is it? Is he okay?"
1937,15,10,Stan Marsh,Turn it up. [Cartman obliges]
1938,15,10,Nurse Bronski,"No no, it's not serious, but he went number two during class. [Cartman grins big, Butters grins a little, Kyle is a little disgusted] I'm afraid he's gonna need a new pair of pants and underwear, and a clean pair of socks."
1939,15,10,Craig Tucker,"Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?"
1940,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! [laughs. Craig moves on]"
1941,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's so wrong!"
1942,15,10,Butters Stotch,[moves off] Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
1943,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman."""
1944,15,10,Mr Mackey,[over the PA system] Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.
1945,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh Jesus, what now?! [goes to the office]"
1946,15,10,Principal Victoria,"Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom."
1947,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! [slaps the table and laughs]"
1948,15,10,Principal Victoria,"Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying."
1949,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me."
1950,15,10,Principal Victoria,"Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?"
1951,15,10,Eric Cartman,"[smiles] Yeah, he killed himself."
1952,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Yes, and the reason he killed himself, Eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students, [points] spearheaded by you, cause him-!"
1953,15,10,Eric Cartman,Hey! Whoooa.
1954,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out."
1955,15,10,Eric Cartman,"'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!"
1956,15,10,Mr Adler,"Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete."
1957,15,10,Principal Victoria,Please just let it go.
1958,15,10,Eric Cartman,You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
1959,15,10,Mr Mackey,"We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!"
1960,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants."
1961,15,10,Principal Victoria,"[stands up and walks to the window, then looks out] Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around."
1962,15,10,Eric Cartman,[scoff] Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
1963,15,10,Principal Victoria,"If Pete Melman does not kill himself, [turns around] we will make it very worth your while."
1964,15,10,Eric Cartman,You aren't listing to anythin- [checks himself] Make it worth my while how?
1965,15,10,Stan Marsh,No way.
1966,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,What's up?
1967,15,10,Stan Marsh,The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
1968,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's fucked up."
1969,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Come on dude, it's pretty funny."
1970,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
1971,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, that's pretty funny."
1972,15,10,Butters Stotch,It's megasuperhilarious! [a girl is putting her books away when Cartman approaches her]
1973,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?"
1974,15,10,Jenny Simon,What do you want?!
1975,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?"
1976,15,10,Jenny Simon,"[gets her bag lunch, closes her locker and walks away] Yeah, it's gross! [Cartman stands by her locker for a moment, then catches up to her]"
1977,15,10,Eric Cartman,"So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. [takes out a box of cupcakes from his backpack]"
1978,15,10,Jenny Simon,[unimpressed] So what?
1979,15,10,Eric Cartman,I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of... [gulps] liked you.
1980,15,10,Jenny Simon,I don't like you!
1981,15,10,Eric Cartman,"I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake? [getting uncomfortable, he puts the cupcake in the box and the box away in his back pack] Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. [walks quickly away]"
1982,15,10,Jenny Simon,"Hey. Wait. [Cartman stops and Jenny catches up] Look, I'm sorry. That was mean. I'd love to try one of your mom's cupcakes."
1983,15,10,Mr Garrison,"And now number 17 many of you got wrong as well. The correct answer was D, whales are mammals. [Jenny gets a sharp pain in her stomach]"
1984,15,10,Jenny Simon,Oh! Gahhh. Ohf.
1985,15,10,Mr Garrison,They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
1986,15,10,Eric Cartman,"[concerned, while Mr. Garrision is talking] You okay, Jenny?"
1987,15,10,Jenny Simon,"Yeah, I'm fine, I just- Awwgh! [can't stand it much longer] M-Mr. Garrison? Can I please [winces] be excused?"
1988,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. [Jenny moans even more]"
1989,15,10,Mr Garrison,What's the matter?
1990,15,10,Jenny Simon,Gah I just need to go to the restroom!
1991,15,10,Mr Garrison,Well okay.
1992,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class."
1993,15,10,Jenny Simon,Please! I've gotta go now!
1994,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp."
1995,15,10,Jenny Simon,"[leaves her seat] No, Mr. Garrison, I've gotta- go- AAAH! [lets out a wet fart]"
1996,15,10,Class,Eeeeww! [Jenny can't hold it in. Bebe and Stan leave their seats while Cartman stands on his desk]
1997,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants! [Millie, Token, and Wendy leave] Did you hear that?! [Kyle and Clyde leave] It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!"
1998,15,10,Kids,Ew!
1999,15,10,Butters Stotch,Sick!
2000,15,10,Eric Cartman,WAY worse!
2001,15,10,Timmy Burch,Run. [Jenny begins to bawl]
2002,15,10,Principal Victoria,...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
2003,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright, kewl."
2004,15,10,Mr Mackey,"[shoots back] No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!"
2005,15,10,Eric Cartman,"You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! [shows them the story on his iPhone]"
2006,15,10,Principal Victoria,"[shoving her chair aside. It falls to the floor] That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!"
2007,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Nobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!"
2008,15,10,The three adults,Yes!
2009,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Christ! [thinks hard] Okay, okay. [squeezes his eyes shut, puts his hands over them, removes the right hand] Um, Jesus- [removes the left hand] ah... Okay, look. [the adults lean in a bit] Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?"
2010,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Our students did average, maybe just below average."
2011,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you... [turns his head left for a moment, still hasn't opened his eyes] you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. [Victoria, Adler, and Mackey just stare at him]"
2012,15,10,Principal Victoria,That's insane!
2013,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? [Mr. Adler looks at Principal Victoria, Principal Victoria looks at Mr. Mackey, Mr. Mackey places a call.]"
2014,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay."
2015,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her ""soft-serve Simon."""
2016,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,That's not funny.
2017,15,10,Craig Tucker,"Hey, here's a post about Token: ""Token Black's Private Gym Photos"" [laughs]"
2018,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,[rolls his eyes] I'm not looking at that!
2019,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!"
2020,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
2021,15,10,Stan Marsh,I wouldn't care.
2022,15,10,Craig Tucker,Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
2023,15,10,Stan Marsh,What?
2024,15,10,Craig Tucker,"""In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."""
2025,15,10,Stan Marsh,"[sees Kenny and walks up to him at his locker] Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!"
2026,15,10,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
2027,15,10,Stan Marsh,How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
2028,15,10,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know.)
2029,15,10,Stan Marsh,Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
2030,15,10,Kenny McCormick,(No!)
2031,15,10,Stan Marsh,That was a private e-mail from me to you! [notices a pissed-off Wendy approaching] Hey Wendy.
2032,15,10,Wendy Testaburger,"You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!"
2033,15,10,Kenny McCormick,(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!) [closes his locker and leaves]
2034,15,10,Stan Marsh,"No, I was telling Kenny he would like it."
2035,15,10,Wendy Testaburger,Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! [Stan leans away a bit]
2036,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this."
2037,15,10,Wendy Testaburger,"So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! [Stan stays silent]"
2038,15,10,Stan Marsh,"This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all! [The others present are Red, Kenny, Butters, Craig (looking at his iPhone), Wendy, Kyle, Bebe, and Token. Kyle raises his hand] Yes, Kyle."
2039,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,"So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?"
2040,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!"
2041,15,10,Wendy Testaburger,Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. [Butters laughs at Wendy's wisecrack in a weird way]
2042,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room! [the other eight look at each other] Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch! [pounds the podium with his fists] And we're not gonna-!"
2043,15,10,Craig Tucker,[reading off his iPhone] It's not somebody in this room.
2044,15,10,Stan Marsh,What? How do you know?
2045,15,10,Craig Tucker,"Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: ""Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker."" [laughs] Yeah. Hey wait, that's me."
2046,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,Where is it coming from?
2047,15,10,Craig Tucker,Huh?
2048,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,If it's on the school network we can track the IP address. [takes Craig's iPhone and sets about tracing the IP address. The kids head into the hallway and pass by the music room] This way. In here. [they stop at the music room door] Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
2049,15,10,Stan Marsh,We only have music class on Thursday.
2050,15,10,Wendy Testaburger,Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
2051,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
2052,15,10,Stan Marsh,Oh I'm ready!
2053,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,"One. [Stan makes fists and tenses up] Two. Three! [opens the door and the nine kids run in, but they're all surprised at what they see. It's a gerbil typing away into the Eavesdropper Web site. This week on Spee: Jenny Simons Still On Suicide Watch]"
2054,15,10,Craig Tucker,It's a rat! [the gerbil noticed them and runs away]
2055,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,Get it! [the kids give chase. Craig and Kyle run into each other and fall trying to get the gerbil. Bebe and Token fall giving chase]
2056,15,10,Stan Marsh,Don't let him get away!
2057,15,10,Token Black,He's gone!
2058,15,10,Stan Marsh,What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
2059,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wikileaks. [Kyle is now at the computer looking at the login screen] It says here his name is Wikileaks.
2060,15,10,Frog King,"Lemmiwinks! I come with news of great gravity. Another rodent is out there, spreading terrible rumors and hacking e-mails. [Lemmiwinks makes some noises] Yes. And I'm afraid the news is worse. The creature doing this, Lemmiwinks, is your brother, Wikileaks!"
2061,15,10,Singer,"''Wikileaks, the bum hacker with a heart of doom.Everyone knows the gerbil king, but no one ever speaksOf Lemminwinks's brother, the evil Likiweaks..."
2062,15,10,Frog King,"Once again Wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world. Only you can stop him, Lemmiweaks."
2063,15,10,Singer,"Lemmiwinks, King of Gerbils, stop your brother of doom!"
2064,15,10,Girl 1,It's just so embarrassing. What if the other girls find out my mother is in rehab?
2065,15,10,Girl 2,"It's okay Emily. Can I tell you a secret? My mom has a drinking problem too. [above them, Wikileaks is recording everything they say]"
2066,15,10,Emily Anderson,Really? You too?
2067,15,10,Girl 2,"That's just between us, okay?"
2068,15,10,Emily Anderson,"Of course, Tammy. I'm really glad I shared this with you. [Stan and his gang spot Wikileaks]"
2069,15,10,Stan Marsh,Stop that rat! [Wikileaks jumps off the lockers and runs for the computer lab]
2070,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Knock it off! [Wikileaks hops off and heads for the nearest air vent, and makes his escape]"
2071,15,10,Boy 1,"I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and- [Wikileaks runs by and snatches the phone away in his teeth] HEY! [Wikileaks runs to the nearest computer, logs in, and types in the latest headline: ""TOMMY EDWARDS HAS A CRUSH ON MARLA WATKINS"" Butters looks in and spots Wikileaks. Wikileaks notices him]"
2072,15,10,Butters Stotch,NO Wikileaks! Bad!
2073,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm."
2074,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Eh, Is this one good?"
2075,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I think they're all ready."
2076,15,10,Principal Victoria,"You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?"
2077,15,10,Eric Cartman,It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
2078,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us."
2079,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?! [leaves the preparation table and faces them] I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!"
2080,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler. [Mr. Adler leaves, then returns with a grinning Selena Gomez]"
2081,15,10,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You [gasp] you actually got her to come! [grins]
2082,15,10,Selena Gomez,Hi Eric. I understand you really wanted to meet me. Wanna get a picture together?
2083,15,10,Eric Cartman,"No thanks. Okay, proceed."
2084,15,10,Mr Mackey,"I/m sorry about this, Ms. Gomez. [Mr. Mackey punches her on the stomach twice. Cartman is awed, then smiles. Principal Victoria then smashes Gomez on the head with a baking tray] Alright, get her the fuck out of here. [Mr. Adler hauls Ms. Gomes away.]"
2085,15,10,Principal Victoria,"Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?"
2086,15,10,Eric Cartman,That. Was. Amazing.
2087,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here! [they hear some small gerbil sounds] What the? [notices Likiweaks on a shelf recording the action] Oh shit! [Wikiweaks runs away] Stop that rat!"
2088,15,10,Frog King,"Alright Lemmiwinks, we should probably get going now... The time is nigh, Lemmiwinks. Let us chase your destiny. [The Sparrow Prince flies in through the open window and lands on the upper edge of the gerbil cage] Ah! Sparrow Prince! What news do you bring?"
2089,15,10,Sparrow Prince,Wikileaks grows stronger with each passing moment. [jumps down into the cage] The birds are tweeting that he is about to release his biggest story yet.
2090,15,10,Frog King,Then the moment is truly here! Come Lemmiwinks! Let us make haste! Le-le-Lemmiwinks? His heart is so heavy. I weep for him.
2091,15,10,Sparrow Prince,"Indeed. Could you do it, Frog Prince? Could you kill your own brother?"
2092,15,10,Frog King,I thank God I don't have to make that decision. [the two of them then just observe Lemmiwinks.] We might need to bring in some outside help.
2093,15,10,Stan Marsh,"You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon."
2094,15,10,Butters Stotch,Biggest story about who?
2095,15,10,Craig Tucker,There's no telling. It could be about any of us. [Stan gets off the computer and notices something happening above him as a blinding light appears. The light softens to reveal the Catatafish]
2096,15,10,Catatafish,"Well met, children of Adam. I, am Catatafish."
2097,15,10,Singers,Catatafish of the Salmon School.
2098,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2099,15,10,Catatafish,I come asking for your help. There is only one thing that can stop Wikileaks. But right now Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner.
2100,15,10,Stan Marsh,Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
2101,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,What is that thing?
2102,15,10,Catatafish,"I am Catatafish. I am a great wizard and, I am a friend. And I'm a ghost, besides of course being a fish."
2103,15,10,Singers,Catatafish's tale will soon be told.
2104,15,10,Stan Marsh,Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
2105,15,10,Catatafish,"He does it purely for reasons of evil. And his treachery is not limited to humans. Wikileaks posted exaggerated things about me, too. He posted on his Web site that I had sex with an underage fish, and that I made her perform bass to mouth. If you accept this quest you will help the Gerbil King defeat Wikileaks once and for all! But the choice is yours. I'm not here to make you do anything. Like that underage salmon. I didn't make her do anything. If she wants to do bass to mouth, how is it my fault?"
2106,15,10,Singers,Catatafish made a salmon suck asshole.
2107,15,10,Catatafish,"No! No, see, that's wrong! It's being exaggerated again!"
2108,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
2109,15,10,Catatafish,"Careful child! I assure you, Wikileaks is anything but stupid, except when he said I made that teenage fish perform ass to trout. That was stupid and untrue. Did I say ass to trout? I meant to say bass to mouth, though I guess it's basically the same thing, not that I did it."
2110,15,10,Principal Victoria,"Alright, are we sure we're alone?"
2111,15,10,Mr Mackey,"We're alone, now what the hell are we gonna do?"
2112,15,10,Mr Adler,What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!
2113,15,10,Principal Victoria,This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!
2114,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Oh right! ""The School Faculty Tries To Poison All Their Students."" That's not gonna be on Wikileaks!"
2115,15,10,Mr Adler,"Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them."
2116,15,10,Mr Mackey,All we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves! We're not bad!
2117,15,10,Principal Victoria,"No, no, we're not bad."
2118,15,10,Mr Mackey,"We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story."
2119,15,10,Principal Victoria,What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
2120,15,10,Mr Adler,Our students committing suicide?
2121,15,10,Mr Mackey,Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.
2122,15,10,Mr Adler,How do we do that?
2123,15,10,Mr Mackey,We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.
2124,15,10,Mother,[answering the door] Yes?
2125,15,10,Stan Marsh,Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?
2126,15,10,Mother,"Yes, Vernon's around somewhere."
2127,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Come on, guys! [charges in with the other kids. Mrs. Trumski is about to close the door when Catatafish floats in]"
2128,15,10,Catatafish,Excuse me.
2129,15,10,Butters Stotch,There he is! [the kids go to the cage] It's Lemmiwinks! [climbs the chair beside Lemminwink's cage]
2130,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Quick, we need something to carry him in!"
2131,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,Here's a shoebox! [goes for the shoebox. Vernon walks in at that moment]
2132,15,10,Vernon and his mom,Hey! What are you doing with my gerbil?!
2133,15,10,Stan Marsh,"We just need to borrow him, kid. [Kyle hands the box to Butters]"
2134,15,10,Vernon and his mom,MOOOM! SOME KIDS ARE STEALING MY GERBIL!
2135,15,10,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Vernon] Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!"
2136,15,10,Vernon and his mom,"MOOOM! [Frogn King and Sparrow Prince appear in the middle of the room, hovering, and Vernon and the others notice]"
2137,15,10,Frog King,"There's no time, children! You must take Lemmiwinks now!"
2138,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,Grab him! [Butters scoops Lemmiwinks into the shoe box and the group runs out the front door]
2139,15,10,Vernon and his mom,[stops just outside the front door] MOOOM! [the group runs down the street]
2140,15,10,Singers,Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
2141,15,10,Frog King,Quickly! We must get to the school! [the group makes it to a bus stop just as a transit bus is pulling away]
2142,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa whoa wait, wait! [the bus stops, the door opens, and the group gets on]"
2143,15,10,Singers,"Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!"
2144,15,10,Stan Marsh,Can't this thing go any faster?
2145,15,10,Butters Stotch,"Hang on, Lemmiwinks!"
2146,15,10,Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!"
2147,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Craig, are we still clear?"
2148,15,10,Craig Tucker,Nothing broke on the Web site yet.
2149,15,10,Frog King,Faster driver! The final battle is about to begin! [the driver speeds up]
2150,15,10,Singers,Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
2151,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell happened?!
2152,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Oh! Oh God! Oh God he killed himself! Eric Cartman killed himself! Did you see that? Oh why would he do it? [pulls out a letter] Oh wait uh here, here's a suicide note. Mkay. [opens it up and reads it:] Dear Guys, I just cannot go on mkay. I'm tired of being FAT, mkay, and I have to end it all. Mkay. -Eric Cartman."
2153,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!"
2154,15,10,Mr Mackey,"[thinks a moment] Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!"
2155,15,10,Sparrow Prince,Go by car!
2156,15,10,Singers,Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
2157,15,10,Frog King,"Quickly, while Lemmiwinks still has it in him!"
2158,15,10,Singers,"Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!"
2159,15,10,Stan Marsh,"Stop right there, you little rat!"
2160,15,10,Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!"
2161,15,10,Frog King,"[appears before Wikileaks and stops him] Wikileaks, you have chosen a path of evil and now you shall pay. Sparrow Prince, Catatafish! [Sparrow Prince and Catatafish descend on the shoebox and open it. Lemmiwinks peeks out, then leaves the box]"
2162,15,10,Frog King,"Oh dude, he is fucking him up!"
2163,15,10,Butters Stotch,Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! [Indeed. Lemmiwinks had bit Wikileaks on the jugular and Wikileaks is bleeding. Wikileaks soon stops moving and Lemmiwinks gets off him]
2164,15,10,Frog King,He did it!
2165,15,10,Mr Mackey,"[walks over to the computer and gets to work] Okay, let's just delete all this tabloid garbage, mkay."
2166,15,10,Stan Marsh,Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
2167,15,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes."
2168,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Boy, I say."
2169,15,10,Mr Mackey,"[rounds the corner and sees Cartman] Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice."
2170,15,10,Eric Cartman,It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
2171,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay."
2172,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you're most certainly welcome."
2173,15,10,Mr Mackey,"[walks through them and continues down the hallway] Well students, why don't we uh- [feels a pain in his stomach] Oooh. Oh, gee, uh..."
2174,15,10,Eric Cartman,"Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?"
2175,15,10,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh! [lets out a wet fart] Aaaah! Oh it's bad! [so bad bits of shit shoot out his pants onto the floor] Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH! [that last movement made him fly into the ceiling and back to the floor] OW!"
2176,15,10,Eric Cartman,[softly] I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
2177,15,10,Mr Mackey,"[stands up] Okay, can somebody get me some paper towels?? Or maybe a [poot. He hits the ceiling again and falls on his face] Ooowww, okay! [begins to slide down the hallway propelled by the poop and gas coming out his ass] Ooohhh, it's bad!"
2178,15,10,Frog King,"Congratulations, Lemmiwinks."
2179,15,10,Sparrow Prince,"Thanks to you, private lives will stay private."
2180,15,10,Catatafish,"Yes, we are all free once again to make teenagers do bass to mouth."
2181,15,10,Frog King,Just one question Lemmiwinks: How does it feel to have killed your own brother? [Lemmiwinks just gets up and walks away] Le-Lemmiwinks? [no answer] He's devastated.
2182,15,10,Sparrow Prince,"Yup, he's devastated."
2183,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?"
2184,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,I didn't see the game.
2185,15,11,Randy Marsh,[soft sneeze] You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
2186,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
2187,15,11,Randy Marsh,A musical? [laughs and rises from his chair to approach him] Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! [laughs while moving around the desk]
2188,15,11,Worker 1,"[bearded] Good for you, Nelson. Did you get a blowjob afterwards?"
2189,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,Sure did.
2190,15,11,Worker 2,[clean-shaven] Niice. [Randy's smile turns into a frown]
2191,15,11,Randy Marsh,What?
2192,15,11,Worker 1,I took my girl to see that show last week. Got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards.
2193,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,Forty-five minutes non-stop.
2194,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[surprised, then] Nuh uh."
2195,15,11,Worker 2,It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
2196,15,11,Randy Marsh,[looks back at him for a few seconds] Noh uh.
2197,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,"I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome."
2198,15,11,Randy Marsh,Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
2199,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,Wicked.
2200,15,11,Randy Marsh,[interested] Oh. Wicked.
2201,15,11,Singers and Actors,"...Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe, she was just wicked people
Head to toe...
She wasn't good, to know what goodness is..."
2202,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?"
2203,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Nono, I'm good, thanks."
2204,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Okay, I'll be right back. [gets up and heads for the aisle, passing a couple on the way] 'Scuse me, sorry. [leaves the auditorium]"
2205,15,11,Randy Marsh,Can I get a scotch and soda? [the bartender goes off to prepare it]
2206,15,11,Man 1,Enjoying the show?
2207,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[nervous at first] Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected."
2208,15,11,Man 1,No?
2209,15,11,Randy Marsh,"To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening."
2210,15,11,Man 1,"Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is ""blowjob."""
2211,15,11,Randy Marsh,Subliminal messages?
2212,15,11,Man 1,"It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it ""subtext."" Just listen really, really closely."
2213,15,11,The Wizard of Oz,"While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!"
2214,15,11,Singers and Actors,"Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me"
2215,15,11,Witches,Now let's try ... defying ................... gravity ...
2216,15,11,Male,"....... Look at them ... becoming friends ... here in Oz, you love blowjobs."
2217,15,11,Witches,And new loves cry ... defying ................... gravity ...
2218,15,11,Male,....... Suddenly ... Don't you love free love blowjobs?
2219,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head. [swoons a bit, then looks at Randy, then at his crotch, then at him again] Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? [looks at his crotch again. Randy looks at her in surprise. She giggles and takes off her seatbelt, then leans over and begins to give him a blowjob]"
2220,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[softly] Whoa, no way!"
2221,15,11,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Larry! [Larry continues crying] Dude, why does this happen every time?"
2222,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"Do something, you stupid vegan!"
2223,15,11,Eric Cartman,Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
2224,15,11,Randy Marsh,"You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!"
2225,15,11,Man 2,How long was it?
2226,15,11,Randy Marsh,"She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes."
2227,15,11,Worker 2,"Nice, bro!"
2228,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it."
2229,15,11,Stephen Stotch,What was the show about?
2230,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something."
2231,15,11,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! [Shelly walks up the little ladder to the board and jumps up and down]"
2232,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"Go! Go! [Larry bounces up and down crying, but doesn't fall into the water]"
2233,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now."
2234,15,11,Worker 2,"Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!"
2235,15,11,Randy Marsh,Really??
2236,15,11,Worker 1,"Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker."
2237,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?"
2238,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"[gets off the chair] What?? Randy, are you serious??"
2239,15,11,Randy Marsh,[walks up to Sharon and hugs her] I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
2240,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?"
2241,15,11,Stan Marsh,"Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?"
2242,15,11,Randy Marsh,Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
2243,15,11,Shelly Marsh,Not the vegans!
2244,15,11,Stan Marsh,No. Dad. Please don't do this!
2245,15,11,Mr Feegan,"It takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world! You get labeled ""soft"" or ""silly."" [he must have been talking for a while, for Stan and Shelly look bored] But the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products. Would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan?"
2246,15,11,Shelly Marsh,Yes.
2247,15,11,Mr Feegan,"Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!"
2248,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. [Larry is stunned and drops his fork, then looks as his parents' reactions. His parents are stunned too, but grow angry]"
2249,15,11,Mr Feegan,He does decide for himself! Larry's been a vegan since he was born! [Larry waves at her to keep going]
2250,15,11,Shelly Marsh,Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. [Larry signals for her to keep 'em coming]
2251,15,11,Mr Feegan,"You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets."
2252,15,11,Stan Marsh,"[just outside the dining room on the phone with Randy while Mr. Feegan speaks.] Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out. [no answer] Please answer the phone Dad. [no answer. He looks around] Dad?"
2253,15,11,Country Singer,"Man time! I need some Man Time!
I got the horses fed and the truck locked up, been workin' my fingers to the bone.
Now I need a little bit of man time, gonna see me a Broadway show!"
2254,15,11,Female Sailor,Anything goes
2255,15,11,Male Sailor 1,Blowjob!
2256,15,11,Female Sailor,Anything goes
2257,15,11,Male Sailor 2,Blowjob!
2258,15,11,Singers and Actors,Man time!
2259,15,11,Females,Hear things more clearly
2260,15,11,Males,Day blowjob day!
2261,15,11,Country Singer,"I'm about to get drunk and loud, gonna have me a rowdy good time.
All I need is my girl and my truck and some Rodgers and Hammerstein!"
2262,15,11,Christine,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
2263,15,11,The Phantom of the Opera leads (Christine and the Phantom),"''Sing, my angel of blowjob music!"
2264,15,11,Female,But the tigers come at night!
2265,15,11,Male,On you bed
2266,15,11,Singers and Actors,Man time!
2267,15,11,Males,"...........job, blowjob."
2268,15,11,Females,"It's cold up here, I'm locked up here"
2269,15,11,Singers and Actors,Man time!
2270,15,11,Singers and Actors,Man time!
2271,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!"
2272,15,11,Man 2,"Sounds like a dream, bro."
2273,15,11,Randy Marsh,"It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is ""Wicked"" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times."
2274,15,11,Worker 1,And Wicked moves to Seattle in a couple of weeks.
2275,15,11,Nelson and two USGS Workers,It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
2276,15,11,Stephen Stotch,Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
2277,15,11,Randy Marsh,Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
2278,15,11,Bob Black,Huh?
2279,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[gets up and walks off a bit] Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town."
2280,15,11,Lady 1,"[dressed in cyan]
O what a glorious Sunday. I know what I'd like to do with my time.
''[walks up to man nearby]
Would you like a blowjob?"
2281,15,11,Man 3,Yes I would like a blowjob [smiles]
2282,15,11,Both,Nothing beats a blowjob on football Sunday.
2283,15,11,Lady 1,"[approaches a man on a bench] Excuse me, I'm the queen of blowjobs."
2284,15,11,Man 4,Really? I would love a blowjob.
2285,15,11,All,A woman should give blowjobs on football Sunday
2286,15,11,Lady 1,"I want to be covered in semen on a bed in the Hotel Jerome
[the park bench is pulled away and the actors gather around her]
A woman is prettiest covered in semen."
2287,15,11,All,Give you husband a blowjob when you get home.
2288,15,11,Man 4,"[to Lady 2, dressed in pink] And what about you, my fair lady? Could I trouble you for a quick Lewinsky?"
2289,15,11,Lady 2,"Oh I don't know, kind sir. Blowjobs seem a little degrading to me."
2290,15,11,Man 4,"Come now, a blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart."
2291,15,11,Men,Now get on your knees and put that heart to work!
2292,15,11,All,"Blowjobs, give up your blowjobs."
2293,15,11,Men,"You're guilty at blowjobs, you love giving blowjobs"
2294,15,11,Women,"... Blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs"
2295,15,11,Singers and Actors,So what could be better on a football Sunday? What could be better on a football Sunday?
2296,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"What do you want, Larry? [Larry raises the daisy up slowly, presenting it to her]"
2297,15,11,Larry Feegan,"Today, I went to 7-11 and I ate a Slim Jim. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. Nobody ever stood up for me before. [sets the daisy on the landing, then turns around and trots off. Shelly looks on in wonder]"
2298,15,11,Lady 1,Oh Reginald! How about a hummer at halftime? A Super Bowl suckle from me?
2299,15,11,Reginald,A Supwerbowl hummer at halftime from my lovely blowjob queen!
2300,15,11,Both,Two people in love it's amazing. Tim Tebow please don't let us down. How about a hummer at halftime-?
2301,15,11,Representative,Mr. Randy Marsh?
2302,15,11,Randy Marsh,"And hold! [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there. [to the representative] Uhh, this better be important."
2303,15,11,Representative,It is. I represent some of the biggest names in all of Broadway. They wish to speak with you.
2304,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Really? Oh my Gaw! [to the cast] Take a break, guys. this could be it!"
2305,15,11,Representative,"Mr. Marsh, this is Andrew Lloyd Webber [eating a drumstick]"
2306,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,Helleow.
2307,15,11,Representative,Stephen Schwartz
2308,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,[gruffly] Hey bro.
2309,15,11,Representative,Mr. Elton John. [Elton John belches] and Stephen Sondheim.
2310,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,Sup bro?
2311,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Not much, sup with you guys?"
2312,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"No. I mean, ""sup, bro!"""
2313,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Sit down, Mr. Marsh, we need to have a talk. [Randy takes a seat]"
2314,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
2315,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs."
2316,15,11,Elton John,You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!
2317,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,Musicals are about subtext!
2318,15,11,Randy Marsh,My musical has lots of subtext.
2319,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"""A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work."""
2320,15,11,Randy Marsh,And then she does. It's a metaphor.
2321,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,"Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen""?!"
2322,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!
2323,15,11,Randy Marsh,[rises] Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
2324,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!"
2325,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards! [rises, moving his chair aside] And now I need to get back to rehearsals. [leaves, then stops and turns around] Oh. And if ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. [turns around and walks out]"
2326,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"What do you want, Larry? [he begins to play her a tune]"
2327,15,11,Larry Feegan,"You make me come out of my shell, Shelly.
You give me strength where there was only fear
I ate at a Burger King today, Shelly
And stood up to a boy who called me ""queer""
When you pushed me off the diving board I
...fell.
And you make the world a nicer place, Shelly
So I can come out of my... shell.
[sets the guitar on the landing, then slowly takes off his life preserver and sets it on the landing as well. He turns around and trots off again. He makes a right on the sidewalk and runs]"
2328,15,11,Shelly Marsh,Hey! [Larry stops and looks back] Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? [Larry turns around]
2329,15,11,Singers and Actors,"Blow--- job--- Queen!
Don't stop giving that blowjob. Even when you're tired, don't stop! Don't stop!
Shaaaaroooon!"
2330,15,11,Worker 2,"[leads the group of Randy's friends] Randy! Randy, brah!"
2331,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[to the cast] Uh, and hold. [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. [the actors are frozen in place] What is it now?"
2332,15,11,Worker 2,"Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down."
2333,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[stunned at first, then gets angry] Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! [leaves the table and walks up the aisle towards the exit]"
2334,15,11,Worker 2,"Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him."
2335,15,11,Randy Marsh,[quietly] Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
2336,15,11,Man 2,"Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!"
2337,15,11,Randy Marsh,I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this! [turns] Let's bro down! [goes out the doors]
2338,15,11,Larry Feegan,"Oh no, you built another settlement?"
2339,15,11,Shelly Marsh,And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
2340,15,11,Larry Feegan,[laughing merrily] Oh wow!
2341,15,11,Mrs Feegan,"They're having such a great time together. I really wanna thank you, Sharon."
2342,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too."
2343,15,11,Mrs Feegan,"I have to admit it makes me a little nervous having Larry up there without a life preserver on, but I guess we have to take changes sometimes."
2344,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical."
2345,15,11,Mrs Feegan,"That's right, I, I hear his musical is getting a lot of attention, that it really has a chance of making it."
2346,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim."
2347,15,11,Randy Marsh,Whassup brah?!
2348,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,What brah?!
2349,15,11,Randy Marsh,Sup brah?!
2350,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Take a swing, brah!"
2351,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Right here, brah! [they continue circling each other]"
2352,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Let's go, Sondheim! Wipe the street with his punk ass!"
2353,15,11,Randy Marsh,What makes you the brauthority brah?!
2354,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"West Side Story, brah!"
2355,15,11,Randy Marsh,What brah?!
2356,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Sweeney Todd, brah!"
2357,15,11,Randy Marsh,What brah?! What brah?!
2358,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Merrily We Rode Along, bro! Why you gotta disrespect, bro?!"
2359,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I do respect you, bro!"
2360,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Show some respect, bro!"
2361,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I do respect you, bro!"
2362,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Then stop disrespectin', bro!"
2363,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I respect you, bro!"
2364,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"Okay, I respect you too!"
2365,15,11,Randy Marsh,Okay! [the two men stay quiet begin to relax]
2366,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,The bro down is over! Let's bro out!
2367,15,11,Spectator,Bro out!
2368,15,11,Spectator 2,Party people!
2369,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!"
2370,15,11,Stephen Schwartz,That's what bros fuckin' do!
2371,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,"You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical."
2372,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey, really??"
2373,15,11,Elton John,"Yeh. We can help youse out a li'l bit with the subtext. [checks out a waitress as she passes by - first her breasts, then her face]"
2374,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,"How about instead of ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" we call it... ""The Woman In White"""
2375,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Oh, that is beautiful!"
2376,15,11,Bros,[all approve] Yeeeeeeeah!
2377,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,And a cheer to Randy Marsh. Welcome... to Bro'dway.
2378,15,11,Randy Marsh,Bro'dwaaay!
2379,15,11,Stephen Sondheim,Wooooooooooo!
2380,15,11,Andrew Lloyd Webber,Woohoo!
2381,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Ooof. [rubs the back of his head for a moment, then walks by the sofa, where Sharon is reading a book]"
2382,15,11,Sharon Marsh,Hey hun.
2383,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Hi babe. Sorry, I'm... [stops behind the sofa] kind of hanging out with the guys."
2384,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?"
2385,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it."
2386,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you."
2387,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?"
2388,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Of course not, go ahead, hun."
2389,15,11,Randy Marsh,[heads for the stairs] Alright babe.
2390,15,11,Sharon Marsh,I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
2391,15,11,Randy Marsh,Okay. What's Shelly doing?
2392,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"I gave her those tickets to ""Wicked."" [Randy stops and looks back at Sharon] She's seeing it with her little boyfriend."
2393,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[does a double take, then plants his hands on the bannister] She's WHAT?!"
2394,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see ""Wicked"" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical."
2395,15,11,Randy Marsh,OH! [runs back outside] Shelly! Hold on! [closes the door. Sharon just watches him go and smiles]
2396,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!"
2397,15,11,Randy Marsh,"AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see ""Wicked""?!"
2398,15,11,Sharon Marsh,Why does it matter?!
2399,15,11,Randy Marsh,She's too young for that stuff!
2400,15,11,Sharon Marsh,Too young?!
2401,15,11,Randy Marsh,This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
2402,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!"
2403,15,11,Randy Marsh,I can't!
2404,15,11,Sharon Marsh,WHY?!
2405,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext."
2406,15,11,Sharon Marsh,[crosses her arms and looks away] That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
2407,15,11,Randy Marsh,"D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw ""Wicked""?"
2408,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-"
2409,15,11,Randy Marsh,"And after ""Lion King"" in New York? ""Godspell""? ""Mamma Mia""?"
2410,15,11,Sharon Marsh,Oh my gosh.
2411,15,11,Randy Marsh,Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
2412,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured."
2413,15,11,Randy Marsh,"No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry."
2414,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw ""Grease"" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we- [gasps and puts her hands over her heart] Oh my God!"
2415,15,11,Randy Marsh,AAAA!
2416,15,11,Sharon Marsh,AAAA!
2417,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Shelly! [steps on the gas pedal, and the car goes past 60 mph]"
2418,15,11,Singers and Actors,"No one cares about wicked people.
Now she's gone but we don't care.
And are we gonna live in peace, and all live free, you'll see.
O Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe-"
2419,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[stopping by random rows] Shelly? Shelly? [he finds her and gets to her row] Shelly, come on. We have to go!"
2420,15,11,Shelly Marsh,"Dad, what are you doing here?"
2421,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Right now, Shelly! [A woman sitting by the aisle shushes him] Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!"
2422,15,11,Elderly Man,Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!
2423,15,11,Randy Marsh,Oh you fucking pervert!
2424,15,11,Usher,"Alright, get the hell out of here, you! [he and another usher haul him away]"
2425,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Shelly! [the two ushers take him outside and away from the playhouse, then push him away.]"
2426,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy! [Randy gets up and smashes a window open with his left elbow, then reaches in. Sharon turns away so she doesn't get hit with shards of glass, then turns back] Randy, what are you doing?!"
2427,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[bent over, putting on a costume] It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! [gets up dressed as Spider-Man, and puts on the mask last. He runs back into the playhouse]"
2428,15,11,The Wizard of Oz,"While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!"
2429,15,11,Singers and Actors,"Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me"
2430,15,11,Audience Member,Ohhhh.
2431,15,11,Audience Member,"Hey, it's Spider-Man"
2432,15,11,Randy Marsh,Sorry! Sorry.
2433,15,11,Randy Marsh,"Agh! [swings onto one of the side balconies, knocking out a man. Randy gets his bearings on a rail and swings back towards the orchestra pit. He knocks out the conductor and finds himself dangling from a chandelier, the cable wrapped around his right ankle. The stage lights go out and the house lights come on]"
2434,15,11,Announcer,"Sorry folks, we are in a hold. We are in a hold."
2435,15,11,Audience Member,Awwwwww. [And that ends that showing]
2436,15,11,Field Reporter,The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater. [one of the actors is being led to an ambulance] The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver. [Shelly begins to sob softly]
2437,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[looks in, then opens the door some more and enters] Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. [backs out and closes the door]"
2438,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[glancing at Sharon from time to time] It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy! [looks at Sharon] I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you. [lies down] I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad."
2439,15,11,Sharon Marsh,I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
2440,15,11,Randy Marsh,Really?
2441,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"[sits up] Oh Randy, [kneels before him. Randy sits up] the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing."
2442,15,11,Randy Marsh,"[rises and kneels before her] Oh Sharon, you're the best. [they laugh and hug each other]"
2443,15,11,Sharon Marsh,"So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?"
2444,15,11,Randy Marsh,"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier."
2445,15,11,Announcer,"""The Book of Mormon."" You'll get a blowjob."
2446,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Last week the students of this school participated in the Presidential Fitness Test. I'm sad to announce that South Park Elementary scored the lowest in health and fitness in the entire country. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] On the whole, you students actually scored fine. But the President's Fitness Test is scored on a school-wide average, and one fourth grader at this school scored so low, with a terrifying body fat score, [Cartman knows the man is talking about him], and high blood pressure and the cholesterol levels of a seventy-year-old man, that it actually brought you entire school's average down to the lowest in the country. [Cartman yawns] However, the Presidential Fitness Program never wants to single out one child, because then that child might feel bad. And so as far as we're concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs."
2447,15,12,Principal Victoria,"Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?"
2448,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Sorry. As far as the board is concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs. And so it is the recommendation of this board that every week, each class will alternate turns, giving up their recesses and instead reporting to PE."
2449,15,12,School Assembly,AWWW!
2450,15,12,PE Coach,"Alright, fourth grade class, you're up first. We're gonna do some rope-climbin'."
2451,15,12,Stan Marsh,God this sucks!
2452,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,Four weeks we gotta do this?
2453,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. [Stan, Kyle, and some other kids are not amused]"
2454,15,12,PE Coach,"Alright McCormick, let's start with you. Climb the rope. [Kenny approaches the rope, jumps up, and starts climbing]"
2455,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. [Kenny climbs down and Kyle approaches]"
2456,15,12,PE Coach,"Alright, let's go Broflovski. [Kyle jumps on and starts climbing]"
2457,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?"
2458,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!"
2459,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us."
2460,15,12,Stan Marsh,Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
2461,15,12,Craig Tucker,Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
2462,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip."
2463,15,12,Wendy Testaburger,"We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!"
2464,15,12,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
2465,15,12,Clyde Frog,Oh grow up.
2466,15,12,Eric Cartman,Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
2467,15,12,Stan Marsh,"That's what we mean by ""grow up"" dude! Stop being a baby!"
2468,15,12,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! [Cartman gasps]"
2469,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl."
2470,15,12,Clyde Frog,"But Eric, you are cool."
2471,15,12,Eric Cartman,"I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault."
2472,15,12,Peter Panda,"It's not your fault, Eric. How can they blame you for what is clearly President Obama's fault?"
2473,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, Peter Panda?"
2474,15,12,Peter Panda,You didn't make that stupid Presidential Fitness Test. Obama did.
2475,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl."
2476,15,12,Eric Cartman,Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
2477,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon."
2478,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver."
2479,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? [the doors burst open and Cartman steps in and looks around. No one says a word]"
2480,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! [slams a door, but it doesn't close. Cartman walks out]"
2481,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club."
2482,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit."
2483,15,12,Fifth Grader,Yeah. The fifth graders agree. We're all being punished for one lazy bitch. Let's make him suffer.
2484,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
2485,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary."
2486,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?"
2487,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair."
2488,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,What do you want me to do about it?
2489,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate."
2490,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"[rises from his chair and approaches a chart] 'Fraid that's impossible. The National Fitness Test has very specific standards. No one child can ever be made to feel singled out. We don't even like to use the term ""physically fit"" anymore because it can make a student feel unphysically fit, and then that student might end up feeling like a total retard."
2491,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?"
2492,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.
2493,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is."
2494,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
2495,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Mom, have you been here all day?!"
2496,15,12,Liane Cartman,"No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?"
2497,15,12,Eric Cartman,Somebody's been in my room! [she looks up at him as he goes back to his room. He looks under his things to see if anything is missing. His mom appears at the door] Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
2498,15,12,Liane Cartman,"Are you sure, sweetie?"
2499,15,12,Eric Cartman,Am I sure?? Look at this place!
2500,15,12,Liane Cartman,But who would want to s-
2501,15,12,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and glares at her] Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me! [goes back to searching his stuff and finds a watch] They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch... [finds a video game] My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have- [looks at a corner of his room. A chair set apart for Clyde Frog is empty, but his other four dolls are arranged and seated in from of it.]  Oh my God. [panicking] Clyde Frog!"
2502,15,12,Liane Cartman,What?
2503,15,12,Eric Cartman,"No. [goes to the corner and tosses his dolls aside, then looks up in despair] NOOO! [runs to his closet and looks in there. He doesn't find Clyde Frog in there] CLYDE FROG!! [stops to tell him mom] They took Clyde Frog! [runs out of his room. Liane is confused]"
2504,15,12,Eric Cartman,"[calling out and walking around] Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?! [stops and notices something on a tree. It is Clyde Frog, nailed to a tree through his front paws and forehead. It's ripped all over and cotton pops out of the rips. Under the frog is the word ""VENGEANCE"" scratched onto the tree bark in red spray paint] Clyde. CLYDE FROG! [throws up]"
2505,15,12,Eric Cartman,"I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers. [Stan and Kyle are falling asleep. Kyle rests his head on his left hand] And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-"
2506,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut the hell up, Cartman!"
2507,15,12,Eric Cartman,Got something to say Kyle?! [grips the sides of the podium]
2508,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
2509,15,12,Eric Cartman,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle! [stops himself] Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. [a bagpipe player begins a tune. Two men lower the casket into the ground]"
2510,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-"
2511,15,12,Craig Tucker,Where's our five dollars?
2512,15,12,Eric Cartman,Fly bu-what?
2513,15,12,Craig Tucker,It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
2514,15,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2515,15,12,Eric Cartman,[thinks a moment] Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
2516,15,12,Class,AWWW! [all the kids get up and leave]
2517,15,12,Kid 1,Come on!
2518,15,12,Kid 2,Screw this.
2519,15,12,Kid 4,"Hurry up, screw this."
2520,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ."
2521,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?"
2522,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"Oh yes, the Boom Boom Chubby Choom Choom school."
2523,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them."
2524,15,12,Board Rep and Receptionist,"[runs to the front door followed by the receptionist] Oh my Jesus! Oh, not a 99% rally."
2525,15,12,Butters Stotch,I sure hope this works.
2526,15,12,Field Reporter 1,"[out of nowhere] Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this? [no comment from either of the boys]"
2527,15,12,Eric Cartman,Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
2528,15,12,Peter Panda,Why would somebody do such a terrible thing?
2529,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl."
2530,15,12,Eric Cartman,"I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!"
2531,15,12,Rumpertumskin,"Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business."
2532,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?"
2533,15,12,Rumpertumskin,"We all know who fuckin' killed Clyde Frog, and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives!"
2534,15,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?"
2535,15,12,Polly Prissypants,Does everything look okay?
2536,15,12,Peter Panda,"Sit down, you fucking bitch."
2537,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party."
2538,15,12,Liane Cartman,"[takes a seat at the other end of the table] Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-"
2539,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Shut your fat piehole, bitch!"
2540,15,12,Rumpertumskin,"Yeah! You know what you did, skank! You let Clyde Frog get murdered!"
2541,15,12,Liane Cartman,"No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear."
2542,15,12,Muscleman Marc,"Then why did you write in your diary ""It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals"" anyway?!"
2543,15,12,Eric Cartman,"That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue."
2544,15,12,Muscleman Marc,"Well, all I'm saying, Eric, is that-"
2545,15,12,Liane Cartman,"Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-"
2546,15,12,Muscleman Marc,"ALL I'M SAYING, ERIC, is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason!"
2547,15,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it."
2548,15,12,Eric Cartman,"So then, we are all going to need some... more tea."
2549,15,12,Sgt Yates,"[on the phone calling for backup] You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks! [hangs up and walks to the command center nearby] Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?"
2550,15,12,Officer 1,"It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area. [next to Red Robin]"
2551,15,12,Sgt Yates,And where are the actual protesters?
2552,15,12,Officer 1,"Oh, these two people right here. [circles the spot on which Butters and Jimmy stand]"
2553,15,12,Sgt Yates,How are we gonna contain this ting?!
2554,15,12,Officer 2,I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.
2555,15,12,Sgt Yates,Bon Jovi?
2556,15,12,Officer 2,"These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer."
2557,15,12,Sgt Yates,Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards? [steps forward] Full-on class warfare.
2558,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What the hell?! [the flames set his curtains on fire. He sees them next to his bed and stands up on the bed] Mom? Mom, my room is... [turns around and sees Peter Panda and his dresser on fire] AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!"
2559,15,12,Fireman 1,The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.
2560,15,12,Eric Cartman,[runs up] Don't you touch him! Leave him alone! [swats the doll out of the fireman's hands] Peter Panda!
2561,15,12,Peter Panda,"Eh, Eric."
2562,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!"
2563,15,12,Peter Panda,Eric... Remember... [sobbing] Stay... keeewl. [Eric begins bawling. The fireman picks the doll back up]
2564,15,12,Fireman 2,"Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence."
2565,15,12,Eric Cartman,[on all fours] Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
2566,15,12,Female Reporter,"The 99%ers movement continues to grow as more and more Americans occupy Red Robin. I asked some of the people exactly what they hoped to accomplish. [earlier] And sir, what do you hope to accomplish by this movement?"
2567,15,12,Red Robin Patron,"I like the uh, A1 Peppercorn Burger. And they got ummm, bo-bottomless fries."
2568,15,12,Female Reporter,"And as the protesters inside Red Robin unite together, word is that filmmaker Michael Moore has joined the protesters outside."
2569,15,12,Michael Moore,[through his bull horn] I look at the faces of you protesters and I see the future of America! We are the 99%! YESSS!!
2570,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?"
2571,15,12,Fifth Grader,Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. You got any proof?
2572,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?"
2573,15,12,Fifth Grader,That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.
2574,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire."
2575,15,12,Fifth Grader,"He's in your class but you don't deal with him! So we are gonna remedy the situation! We've got big plans! Just stay out of our way and let the men handle this! [closes the door. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny turn around to leave.]"
2576,15,12,Liane Cartman,Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
2577,15,12,Bob Black,Of course. You can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage.
2578,15,12,Linda Black,"To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close."
2579,15,12,Liane Cartman,"I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token."
2580,15,12,Eric Cartman,"This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright."
2581,15,12,Token Black,Why are you involving me in this?
2582,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong."
2583,15,12,Field Reporter 2,"Breaking news from the Occupy Red Robin movement. The protesters have decreased in number from two to one, as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement: Occupy the Restroom."
2584,15,12,Field Reporter 1,"Tom, Occupy the Restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now. Certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever. These 99%ers are fed up, [backs up to the restroom door] and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is ""OCCUPIED."" [points to a little window that now reads ""OCCUPIED."" A second later, a toilet is flushed inside. The door opens and Butters exits zipping his pants up.] Uh, Tom, it looks like the movement is finished, but from the time it took, it must have been a pretty decent-sized movement."
2585,15,12,Token Black,[getting irritated] Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
2586,15,12,Eric Cartman,"What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?"
2587,15,12,Token Black,This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
2588,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home."
2589,15,12,Token Black,You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
2590,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me. [the alarm sounds. Cartman puts his chips aside and gathers his toys close] What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!"
2591,15,12,Token Black,That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
2592,15,12,Eric Cartman,What?! Who?!
2593,15,12,Token Black,I don't know.
2594,15,12,Eric Cartman,"I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! [Token looks out his window, Cartman leaves the bedroom]"
2595,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Who's there?! [notices Token coming out behind him] Lock that door behind you, Token. [then shouts at whomever might be there] Black people live here! [some flood lights come on]"
2596,15,12,Token Black,A motion detector. [Kyle's shadow runs by and Cartman notices it. He gives chase and tackles Kyle]
2597,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!"
2598,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!"
2599,15,12,Eric Cartman,Oh sure!
2600,15,12,Stan Marsh,"[walking out from behind a garage] Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned."
2601,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader? [looks around] Oh shit! [drops the bat and runs back inside] I told you to lock that door, Token! [runs up to Token's room and searches for his stuffed toys] No. [sees the other four boys come in] Nononono! [grabs Kenny by the throat and shakes him] Where are they Kenny??!!"
2602,15,12,Kenny McCormick,[slaps Cartman's hand off] (I don't really know!)
2603,15,12,Eric Cartman,"HAAAAGH! [runs out and closes the door, then locks it and runs off]"
2604,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!"
2605,15,12,Eric Cartman,[returns] I don't trust any of you assholes! [to his dolls] Where are you sons of bitches?! [leaves]
2606,15,12,Stephen Tamil and two other Fifth Graders,Alright guys. You ready?
2607,15,12,Classmates,Ready!
2608,15,12,Stephen Tamil and two other Fifth Graders,"Here we GO! [he and one of his friends raise their signs, and the three of them march forth]"
2609,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?"
2610,15,12,Stephen Tamil and two other Fifth Graders,We are the 83%! We are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class! The fourth grade is stickin' it to the other 83% of the school!
2611,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%."
2612,15,12,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?"
2613,15,12,Stephen Tamil and two other Fifth Graders,"Because your class had Cartman in it, and he's the 1%!"
2614,15,12,Jimmy Valmer,"But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%."
2615,15,12,Field Reporter 3,This is it. The inevitable has happened at Occupy Red Robin. It is full-on class warfare.
2616,15,12,Female Reporter 2,And now class warfare is breaking out. Apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class.
2617,15,12,Sgt Yates,It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
2618,15,12,Officer 2,Yeeah!
2619,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Hello?? [lightning crackles outside and floods the kitchen in light for a moment] Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! [sees a boiling crock pot, walks up to it and removes the lid. Inside he see the third...]"
2620,15,12,Eric Cartman,Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! [more lightning crackles as he runs out of the kitchen.]
2621,15,12,Eric Cartman,Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin! [walks towards the fireplace] Jesus Christ! [over the fireplace he sees Rumpertumskin drawn up by four chains and a bomb wrapped around his neck]
2622,15,12,Rumpertumskin,Eric! Don't come any closer!
2623,15,12,Eric Cartman,Who did this to you?!
2624,15,12,Rumpertumskin,You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
2625,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, I'll get you down!"
2626,15,12,Rumpertumskin,"No Eric, don't come any- [Cartman trips a wire that sets off the bomb, decapitating Rumpertumskin]"
2627,15,12,Eric Cartman,AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER [begins to cry] Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
2628,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"It's okay, Eric. It's over now. [you can see Cartman actually doing her voice. He expresses shock, then turns around. Polly Prissypants is seated on an armchair with a loaded gun resting against her]"
2629,15,12,Eric Cartman,Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
2630,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up."
2631,15,12,Eric Cartman,"...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! [Token, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny look down from the second floor]"
2632,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together."
2633,15,12,Eric Cartman,They were your FRIENDS!
2634,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!"
2635,15,12,Bob Black,"Dead-bolted. Token! [knocks twice, then heads for the window] Token, you in there?! [the three adults look in]"
2636,15,12,Eric Cartman,"Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!"
2637,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after."
2638,15,12,Eric Cartman,"There's one problem. [walks up to the doll, takes the gun and walks back to where he was] You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything."
2639,15,12,Polly Prissypants,Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
2640,15,12,Eric Cartman,Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
2641,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric."
2642,15,12,Eric Cartman,"[sobs for almost a minute, then aims the gun] Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you."
2643,15,12,Polly Prissypants,"Say ""hello"" to the sunrise for me. [Cartman cries and looks away as he starts firing at her. First shot is straight through the forehead. He fires twice more as the four boys watch from the second floor, and three more as the Blacks and Ms. Cartman watch from outside. Polly Prissypants has four shots through the head and two more that took out chunks of her cheeks. Cartman cries, having lost the last of his stuffed dolls]"
2644,15,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell?"
2645,15,12,Kyle Broflovski,We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
2646,15,12,Liane Cartman,[apologetic] My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. [laughs weakly]
2647,15,12,Field Reporter 3,"Occupy Red Robin is over. Class warfare has torn apart the 99% and replaced it with the 30%, the 26%, and even little brackets of 5%s here and there. What does this mean for our country? What oes this mean... for me?"
2648,15,12,Officer 2,Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!
2649,15,12,Field Reporter 3,Oh hell yeah! I'll occupy me some goat-cheese peppadew peppers! [runs off]
2650,15,13,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats. [most of them are seated; Kyle, Token, Bebe and Stan are the last four to get seated] As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American."
2651,15,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh neato, huh fellas?"
2652,15,13,Guest,"[a stout ""Native American""] Hello boys and girls. My name is David Running Horse... Sawitsky, and I am one sixteenth Cherokee Indian."
2653,15,13,Eric Cartman,Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? [Sawitsky crosses his arms and is not all all pleased]
2654,15,13,Sawitsky,"There've been a lot of ""stories"" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?"
2655,15,13,Butters Stotch,[innocently] Thanksgiving is about murder?
2656,15,13,Eric Cartman,This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
2657,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over."
2658,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them."
2659,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks over his shoulder angrily] Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!"
2660,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today."
2661,15,13,Stan Marsh,"We all have to do this report together, dude."
2662,15,13,Eric Cartman,"You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV."
2663,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,How is that gonna help?!
2664,15,13,Eric Cartman,"[like a doorbell] Dumbass, it's November. [normally] The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need."
2665,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"You're watching The History Channel, where the truth is history."
2666,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,[as re-enactments play in color and in black and white] A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
2667,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?"
2668,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"[more re-enactments] We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens! [dramatic flashes of darkness as the alien is shown up close, then a picture of a fetus, and then...]"
2669,15,13,Duncan Everton,"[Professor of History, Oakmont H.S.] In every journal entry we researched from those early Pilgrims, not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there."
2670,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"And what about the food? [a juicy baked turkey is shown, then the previous image is shown without the alien] Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? [the alien reappears in the scene, but with two other aliens]"
2671,15,13,Eric Cartman,Uh-huh??
2672,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,What? This isn't history.
2673,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it is called History Channel."
2674,15,13,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
2675,15,13,Charles Biggens,"[Culinary Associates of America] And if we look in all the journals and aall the history books, there is no reference to stuffing before 1621. So where did it come from? Did it come from space? We just don't know."
2676,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form? [an alien with an erect penis is drawn over the aerial image] What exactly did the Pilgrims experience? [colored lights move around over the ocean's horizon as Pilgrims gather by the beach] How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? [a tiny UFO hovers near a turkey]"
2677,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,What??
2678,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?"
2679,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
2680,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? [he and Kenny raise their hands, then Stan raises his]"
2681,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,[at Stan] Dude!
2682,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? [raises Kyle's hand]"
2683,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[sighs] Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!"
2684,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",[sits up in bed] Yes? A report from where? [sits up on the side of the bed] Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can. [hangs up and sits back down]
2685,15,13,Wife,Darling?
2686,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",They found something. This could be it. [makes a fist]
2687,15,13,Eric Cartman,Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
2688,15,13,Stan Marsh,...What?
2689,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause."
2690,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!"
2691,15,13,Eric Cartman,"See what I mean, you guys? [a black car with tinted windows pulls up at a corner within sight of the boys and the passenger window comes down and the agents inside look at the boys]"
2692,15,13,Agent 1,[brunet] Is that them?
2693,15,13,Agent 2,[blond] That's them.
2694,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",You boys have been very busy... [he closes the report] We need to know everything that you know.
2695,15,13,Stan Marsh,'bout what?
2696,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
2697,15,13,Agent 1,Did you come across some kind of ship or something?
2698,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel."
2699,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","[silence for a few seconds, then] We are The History Channel. [rises from his chair] For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence."
2700,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,We saw it on your channel.
2701,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",What exactly did you seez?!
2702,15,13,Stan Marsh,"That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?"
2703,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
2704,15,13,Steven Stotch,"Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel."
2705,15,13,Butters Stotch,Okay Dad.
2706,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"You're watching the History Channel, the only network dedicated to history. Coming up next, it's Monster Quest! Larrh! Followed by Hairy Bikers. Errh! But now, back to Part 3 of Ancient Aliens at Thanksgiving."
2707,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings."
2708,15,13,Stan Marsh,[history expert] Stuffing wasn't mentioned anywhere until 1621? And it might have been... alien technology?
2709,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?"
2710,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[Ph. D., Professor of Thanksgiving - DeVry Institute] Of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can't ""prove"" that... the Pilgrims themselves weren't alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand! Maybe that symbol matches... galaxies in space or something! OooOoOoOooOOO! [moves his hands around]"
2711,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"[a scene of alien families sharing Thanksgiving on Earth] Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say ""yes."""
2712,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
2713,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. [smiles]"
2714,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. [a knock is heard at the front door and Kyle goes to answer it]
2715,15,13,Sawitsky,What are you doing?!
2716,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,...Uh oh.
2717,15,13,Sawitsky,The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
2718,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
2719,15,13,Sawitsky,Haven't my people been through enough?! [whips out a gun with his left hand and quickly aims at at Kyle] Goddamn you!
2720,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,Ack dude! [backs up as Sawitzky walks towards him]
2721,15,13,Sawitsky,"The white man is gonna PAY for his lies! [stops in front of Stan and Kenny, keeping his gun aimed at Kyle]"
2722,15,13,Agent 2,"Look at this, sir! [hands him a picture] An aerial photograph of Cape Cod where the Pilgrims landed in 1620. [puts his right hand on it and traces a turkey on the photo with it] Five Pilgrim settlements, with Plymouth Rock here. [puts a dot on the location] The same symbols appear everywhere in history. [on a baked turkey, in the night sky...]"
2723,15,13,Agent 1,"The symbology lines up to mirrored points in space. If Kyle Broflovski is right, then Plymouth Rock is some kind of wormhole."
2724,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
2725,15,13,Agent 3,Sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things.
2726,15,13,Agent 2,True dat.
2727,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",True dat.
2728,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
2729,15,13,Agent 4,"[through his bullhorn] Alight people, let's clear out! We need you ALL to disperse! [a woman and her daughter stop to listen] This area is under quarantine. [the woman and daughter leave]"
2730,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Give me a piece of chalk. [agent 1 hands it to him. The president quickly traces a turkey on the rock, then backs up.] Huh... Nothing."
2731,15,13,Agent 5,Guess Kyle Broflovski was wrong.
2732,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid. [they all turn and walk out of the water] We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space."
2733,15,13,Agent 6,Here. You can see it right there. An object clearly fell from the sky and struck the Earth.
2734,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",What is it?
2735,15,13,Agent 6,"It's a Pilgrim, sir. [the president is stunned, looks outside, then walks outside with five other men]"
2736,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all. [the camera pans up into the sky. Another camera travels through space]"
2737,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets. [the camera approaches a rock formation that has golden (literally) ears of corn sticking out of it. The camera then goes around the formation and through a thick cloud layer] These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth. [the camera pops up and sees a magnificent building from which rise four massive golden ears of corn. An entrance with 14 colossal Pilgrim statues is shown. Inside the cathedral-like building a Pilgrim king, seated on a throne flanked by two huge golden cornucopias overflowing with gold and jewels, speaks to a huge crowd]"
2738,15,13,Pilgrim King,Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!
2739,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples","Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING! [the Indians cheer]"
2740,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?"
2741,15,13,Liane Cartman,What hon?
2742,15,13,Eric Cartman,Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
2743,15,13,Liane Cartman,"Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet."
2744,15,13,Eric Cartman,Oh no. Oh NO!
2745,15,13,Liane Cartman,"What is it, hon?"
2746,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! [turns around and leaves the kitchen]"
2747,15,13,Eric Cartman,You guys have stuffing?!
2748,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.
2749,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come! [Liane takes a shopping cart and follows Cartman to the right aisle. Cartman looks for the stuffing, but doesn't fine any. The attendant walks by] Hey! Where is it!"
2750,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,"It's right there, right on the uh... [sees that the stuffing shelf is empty] wait, that can't be right. Hey, hey Chet. What happened to all the stuffing?"
2751,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,"[walks up] What are you talking about? [sees that there is no stuffing, and his jaw drops a bit]"
2752,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,"We got more in the back, right?"
2753,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,"I just did inventory in the back, it... it was all put out here!"
2754,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,You mean it's two weeks until Thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing?!
2755,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,Oh no!
2756,15,13,Eric Cartman,No!
2757,15,13,Attendant 1 and Chet,No!
2758,15,13,Eric Cartman,NO!
2759,15,13,Pilgrim King,"You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!"
2760,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",The stuffing mines were never yours!
2761,15,13,Pilgrim King,"Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!"
2762,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!
2763,15,13,Pilgrim King,And how knoweth you that?!
2764,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",Word travels fast in our sector.
2765,15,13,Pilgrim King,"I do not give free bowls of stuffing, what sayest you?! We will take back control of the stuffing mines! [turns and leaves with his men]"
2766,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",Then the Thanksgiving treaty will be off! [turns and leaves with his men]
2767,15,13,Pilgrim King,"And I pray to stuffing that you are wrong. [looks up to the sky as his men move on without him] Where are you, Miles Standish?"
2768,15,13,"David ""Running Horse"" Sawitzky","And furthermore, everything Kyle Broflovski said about Native Americans being from outer space was untrue! Native Americans were brutalized, and David Sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology! It was wrong to mix aliens and real history!"
2769,15,13,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?"
2770,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[through gritted teeth] Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!"
2771,15,13,Stan Marsh,I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
2772,15,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, that's true.)"
2773,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,Would you guys stop!
2774,15,13,Sawitsky,Just keep writing your apology! [paces. The front door opens and Miles Standish jumps in dramatically]
2775,15,13,Miles Standish,"How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?!"
2776,15,13,Sawitsky,[surprised] Huh? [Miles runs at him and throws him up against a wall] Ack.
2777,15,13,Stan Marsh,Dude!
2778,15,13,Miles Standish,"You Indians took me to thy planet, and then cast me here! Why?! [punches Sawitzky twice. Sawitzky falls to the floor and Miles begins kicking him in the balls]"
2779,15,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Go, dude!)"
2780,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, go on dude!"
2781,15,13,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
2782,15,13,Miles Standish,"[turns Sawitzky over and picks him up] Hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die?! Tell me, Indian!"
2783,15,13,"David ""Running Horse"" Sawitzky",I I uh I'm only one sixteenth.
2784,15,13,Miles Standish,"Hold your lying tongue! [puts a glowing ball into Sawitzky's mouth] This shall prove if thou art Indian or not! [Sawitzky begins to tremble and moan, then he's surrounded by a purple light and consumed] Ah, he was not."
2785,15,13,Stan Marsh,I didn't think so.
2786,15,13,Miles Standish,"[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] I have been told of your expertise, Kyle of DeVry Institute. I need your wisdom to get back to my planet."
2787,15,13,Miles Standish,Into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me! [the boys get in] We must make haste to Cape Cod! [then he does]
2788,15,13,Stan Marsh,[looking at the driver] Who's this?
2789,15,13,Miles Standish,This is Natalie.
2790,15,13,Natalie Portman,Hi guys.
2791,15,13,Agent 7,"Alright, sir. We got some more information on the Pilgrim who crashed to Earth. Thirty seconds after impact the Pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat."
2792,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Who did the truck belong to?
2793,15,13,Agent 6,"We believe it belonged to Natalie Portman, sir."
2794,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",The actress? That doesn't make sense.
2795,15,13,Agent 8,It gets worse. All over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing. We don't think it's coincidence.
2796,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this ""Pilgrim"" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!"
2797,15,13,Agent 9,"Look, if anyone knows about stuffing, it's Natalie Portman!"
2798,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","[walking forward, filling the screen] We have to find Professor Broflovski. He was right about all of this. He'll know what to do."
2799,15,13,Miles Standish,We shall make camp here for the night. On the morrow perhaps we can reach Cape Cod. And Thanksgiving may yet be saved. [looks outside and sees Kyle] What is wrong with Kyle of DeVry Institute?
2800,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing."
2801,15,13,Miles Standish,"[studying Kyle some more] He seems almost like a Puritan lady whose period hath stopped. [moments later, he goes outside to talk to Kyle] I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on."
2802,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, ah I don't."
2803,15,13,Miles Standish,"It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world."
2804,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,I actually only just said that sarcastically.
2805,15,13,Miles Standish,"HA1 Ha ha ha ha ha ha! [pats him on the left shoulder a few times] Then you are only just a remarkably gifted child! [puts his right hand over Kyle's left hand, then withdraws it to pull out a map] Here, let me show you. Your planet is one of the five. [points to the others] Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim, and this planet over here nobody really cares about. [spreads his right hand over the map so each fingertip touches a planet, then traces the hand with a pencil] The five are connected by a series of wormholes. [the trace is finished] My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over."
2806,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them."
2807,15,13,Miles Standish,"You can't believe what everyone tells you, Kyle. You have to open your eyes. [stands up and puts down his map on his seat. Natalie, Stan, and Kenny look on from the trailer] Soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to Plymouth, and the stuffing mines can again be ours, for he who controls the stuffing, controls the universe. [all of a sudden, a night sun focuses on him and a helicopter is heard]"
2808,15,13,A pilot,"Hold it right there! [five black cars pull up quickly and surround Miles and Kyle. Natalie, Stan and Kyle leave the trailer]"
2809,15,13,Agent 1,We found Professor Broflovski! He is with the Pilgrim! [the agents close in on Miles and he unsheathes his sword]
2810,15,13,Miles Standish,"Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death!"
2811,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","[rushes into the middle] Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open."
2812,15,13,Miles Standish,"I trust none but them! [points to the party he came with - Natalie, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] Indians hath betrayed us! I must return to Plymouth so my king can know the truth! [hurries away]"
2813,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",PLEASE! [stops him] We're the History Channel. We care as much about the truth as you do.
2814,15,13,Miles Standish,Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible!
2815,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples","[shot through with several arrows] My Lord! My Lord, the battle is lost! We have tried to stop the Indians on their home planet, but yea they are too strong!"
2816,15,13,Pilgrim King,Then our last chance for survival is gone?
2817,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",I'm sorry my Lord. All Pilgrim forces sent to the Indians' planet have been wiped out.
2818,15,13,Pilgrim King,And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!
2819,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",The stuffing mines are ours! [some Indians celebrate at the mines]
2820,15,13,Miles Standish,"Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving."
2821,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work."
2822,15,13,Miles Standish,"Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal."
2823,15,13,Agent 11,The keeper of the... of course! Natalie Portman!
2824,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
2825,15,13,Agent 12,"Our window of opportunity is closing, sir! The wormhole has to be opened now!"
2826,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole."
2827,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. No."
2828,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!"
2829,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmm. [then to the right] Uh uh."
2830,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
2831,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. No."
2832,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?! [everyone moves aside to reveal Kyle] What do we do, Professor Broflovski?"
2833,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not a professor.
2834,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",The History Channel said you were!
2835,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,You are the fucking History Channel!
2836,15,13,Miles Standish,"[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] Please, Kyle of DeVry Institute. There is no more time for squabbles. The universe is at stake!"
2837,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot",[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here. [points to Kyle's heart.] You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
2838,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?"
2839,15,13,Natalie Portman,"I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child."
2840,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[having trouble with small talk] Wow, awesome. Um..."
2841,15,13,Natalie Portman,"I have dual citizenship in the United States and Israel. [a waiter with a bottle of wine walks by and Kyle snaps his fingers twice, then indicates to the waiter that Natalie should get some more wine. The waiter serves it] Oh thanks."
2842,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Um... so... [behind him, everyone involved in the portal matter is watching them] So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that."
2843,15,13,Natalie Portman,"Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too."
2844,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
2845,15,13,Natalie Portman,"Thanks, that was a lot of fun."
2846,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it was cool, thanks. [looks over his shoulder. Miles motions at him to continue] Um, so... Is there any way you'd"
2847,15,13,Natalie Portman,What?
2848,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You know, could youuu..."
2849,15,13,Natalie Portman,What?
2850,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,Would you please just open your wormhole?!
2851,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Oh. [moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Mmmm... [moves her torso to the right] no."
2852,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,[sighs in exasperation] Errh!
2853,15,13,Natalie Portman,"[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. Okay."
2854,15,13,Miles Standish,Yes!
2855,15,13,"THC President and Wife, his agents, and a helicopter pilot","Alright, let's go, folks! [he and several other men go towards Plymouth Rock]"
2856,15,13,Natalie Portman,Just for a sec though. [turns around and joins them]
2857,15,13,Miles Standish,"Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!"
2858,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. [behind the rock, Natalie's legs go up in the air]"
2859,15,13,Stan Marsh,"It's cool dude, we understand."
2860,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,I guess we should all realize... [the portal is activated] that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. [the portal shoots out into space towards planet Plymouth]
2861,15,13,Miles Standish,"[rises with his sword unsheathed] Now make way, children! For I have a war to fight! [runs towards the rock, jumps on it, and into the portal stream] For stuffing!! [goes towards planet Plymouth]"
2862,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples",Take ALL their stuffing!
2863,15,13,"Indian Chief and Pilgrim King, and their peoples","The treaty ends now! [the Indians retreat as flying galleons sweep over the stuffing mines with powerful rays, destroying any Indians along the way]"
2864,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army."
2865,15,13,Miles Standish,Now attack their left flank! Good! They're retreating! Hit them with the anti-Indian device! [A destroyer walks in and obliterates all the Indians with its powerful beams]
2866,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables."
2867,15,13,Random Voices,Yea. Stuffing mines. Yea.
2868,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.
2869,15,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before."
2870,15,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, History Channel rules."
2871,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been... [an image of a woman appears against a wall] haunted!
2872,15,13,Donald T Brown,"[Ph. D., University of Phoenix] There is certainly no evidence that the first Thanksgiving dinner was not haunted."
2873,15,13,Announcer and Narrator,"The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? [ghostly figures appear here and there.]"
2874,15,13,Eric Cartman,Uhhh??
2875,15,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[throws up his arms in exasperation] Oh, come on!!"
2876,15,14,Stuart McCormick,"You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!"
2877,15,14,Kevin McCormick,"Yes, 'cause you're a drunk piece of shit, Dad!"
2878,15,14,Mrs McCormick,You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!
2879,15,14,Kevin McCormick,Shut up!
2880,15,14,Announcer,They're noisy.
2881,15,14,Man 1,"Fuck you, bitch! [runs out of the trailer]"
2882,15,14,Woman 1,"[throws an unlabeled crumpled empty bottle at him] Fuck you, you son of a bitch! [the man turns around and walks back to the trailer to hit her]"
2883,15,14,Announcer,They're nasty.
2884,15,14,Woman 2,"[redhead, to a blonde] You done spilled that on my titties, skank! [shoves her off her feet, taking the beer the blonde was holding and finishing it off]"
2885,15,14,Woman 3,Oww...
2886,15,14,Announcer,"They're white trash. And when you give them a little Pabst Blue Ribbon [an image of the beer bottle fills the screen], they can't help getting arrested. [Kevin picks up a block and throws it at Stuart, hitting him on the forehead. Onscreen, police break up a fight among several men] Tonight, on an all-new... White Trash... In Trouble!"
2887,15,14,Narrator,Pabst Blue Ribbon and white trash. It's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home.  This white trash home in Colorado seems innocent enough. [The McCormick home is shown]
2888,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,"[sits up upon recognizing the house] (Hmmm. What the fuck?) [goes to see what's going on. Stuart and Kevin continue to fight, and Mrs. McCormick tries to intervene, only to have Stuart slap her.]"
2889,15,14,Narrator,"But the children in this home live in a world of neglect. There's no heating, no groceries, [a spotlight pans around the back yard] and if you look closely in the backyard, you can even make out what appears to be a meth lab. [a red arrow points to a small shed against the house which does indeed have a meth lab in it. Kenny looks out a window next to the back door.]"
2890,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,"[runs back to warn his parents] (Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) [Kevin has gotten on Stuart's back and is choking him. At the front door, police make use of a battering ram to get into the house. They all rush in and surround the family]"
2891,15,14,Cops,"Down on the ground! Move it! Let's go! Move move! Get down, now! [The parents get on their knees and put their hands behind their heads. Ten officers end up in the living room with guns drawn. There are twice as many officers outside.]"
2892,15,14,Mrs McCormick,No! Muh babies! Don't take my babies!
2893,15,14,Stuart McCormick,[taken to one car] You're hurting my arm!
2894,15,14,Mrs McCormick,[taken to another] My babies!
2895,15,14,Stuart McCormick,You're hurting me!
2896,15,14,Officer 1,"You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."""
2897,15,14,Stuart McCormick,"I'm white trash and I'm in trouble. [""IN TROUBLE"" is stamped on the screen right away. This happens after every admission of ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.""]"
2898,15,14,Officer 1,"Alright, good. Now get in the car! [Stuart gets in. A crowd gathers to view this scene]"
2899,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[filming with his phone] Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence. [chuckles and waves with his left hand] Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave! [to his phone] That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny."
2900,15,14,Officer 2,"Just have a seat in there, kids. [puts the kids into the back seat]"
2901,15,14,Kevin McCormick,"[still drunk, but mocking] Just have a seat in there, kids. [the cop closes the door]"
2902,15,14,Officer 1,"The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room."
2903,15,14,Officer 3,The soft room?
2904,15,14,Officer 1,"You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in."
2905,15,14,Mr Adams,"Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay?"
2906,15,14,Karen McCormick,"[scared, sniffling, she holds on to Kenny] Can I see my mommy?"
2907,15,14,Mr Adams,"No, sorry. Now, [opens a folder] I've been looking over your file and I see you kids have all been horribly physically and emotionally abused. [the kids look at him in astonishment] Oh whoops, that isn't your case file, it's the Penn State University Gazette. [laughs] I'm joking, that's just a joke, we like to have fun here. [closes the folder and shows it to the kids] It is your case file. I was just all like ""it's the Penn State Gazette"" to be like a joke, we have fun. Now listen, you're gonna be put into a foster home, so I need to know... would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic church, or Penn State University? [laughs at his own joke] We're havin' fun here, aren't we? I just, I come up with these and the guys, it's good to laugh. [goes to the door and yells into the hall] I just asked them if they wanted to go to Neverland, a Catholic church, or Penn State. [closes the door and returns to his chair] I'm a trickster. People say I'm really meant for comedy. Here's my head shot just in case you know anybody. [shows his picture, then hands out copies to the kids] Can't hurt, right? Okay, now, are we all startin' to feel a little bit better? [Karen cries] Oh come on now, how about that smile? I'm gonna GET [holds out his right palm] you to smile! I'm gonna GET [holds out his right palm again] you to smile! [silence] A Penn State administrator walks into a bar. Where's that smile? How about this one? Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station. Come on, that's a good one."
2908,15,14,Stan Marsh,Did you hear anything more about what happened?
2909,15,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious."
2910,15,14,Stan Marsh,We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
2911,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[runs up to the other two with a memo pad] Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers."
2912,15,14,Stan Marsh,Really?
2913,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!"
2914,15,14,Kyle Broflovski,That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
2915,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo- [noticing Craig coming into view] sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes. [as Craig passes by] Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? [stifles a laugh]"
2916,15,14,Craig Tucker,What are you talking about?
2917,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. [stifles a laugh]"
2918,15,14,Officer 2,"Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, we have the new foster kids for your care. [the kids enter]"
2919,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Very good, we'll take them from here. Children, enter. [the kids walk in further, the cops leave, Mr. Weatherhead closes the door, and Mrs. Weatherhead's face gets stern] Welcome to your new home. Before we show you around let's get one thing clear: this is a very strict religious household! As long as you live here you will be agnostic! [leads the children to a group of nine other kids] These are your foster brothers and sisters! They are all strict agnostics! David, do you believe in God?!"
2920,15,14,David (blond boy with glasses),[blond boy with glasses] I don't know...
2921,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Right! There are two bedrooms upstairs! Boys' room and girls' room! Your chores are listed on their respective doors! Follow! [guides them into the kitchen] You will eat only at designated meal times! Beverages you may take from the refrigerator as you like! However, in this house you will drink only agnostic beverages! [opens the refrigerator door to reveal the contents] Dr Pep-er, and Diet Dr Pep-er! [takes out a can and shows it to the kids] Because what flavor is it?! It is neither root beer nor cola! Nobody is sure what flavor it is, and nobody can be sure! Isn't that right, Melissa?!"
2922,15,14,Melissa (ginger girl),[ginger girl] I don't know.
2923,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,Good!
2924,15,14,Eric Cartman,"This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!"
2925,15,14,Butters Stotch,"Yep. To find out who the poorest kid is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch."
2926,15,14,Eric Cartman,Eh yeah?
2927,15,14,Butters Stotch,So then I cross-referenced all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
2928,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[laughs] Heh heh, yeah?"
2929,15,14,Butters Stotch,"Well actually, Eric, it's you. [Cartman keeps his smile for a few seconds more, then frowns.]"
2930,15,14,Eric Cartman,What?
2931,15,14,Butters Stotch,"Now that Kenny's gone, [points to Cartman] your household actually has the lowest income. [Cartman is stunned, then dejected. Butters consoles him] I'm sorry, pal."
2932,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[hops off his chair and moves off a bit, then gets a panicked look] Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does."
2933,15,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, I won't tell anybody."
2934,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and glares at Butters] Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew! [makes a fist, then crosses his arms] Well I won't give him the satisfaction!"
2935,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Alright, let's hear it for Kyle! [claps] He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! Yeah, that's super funny, guys! [Stan and Kyle turn from their lockers to look at him] Laugh it up, everyone! [ends up by Stan and Kyle] Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!"
2936,15,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[slowly so that there's no mistake] My name. Is not. ""Kyel""."
2937,15,14,Eric Cartman,That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! [runs away]
2938,15,14,Liane Cartman,"Hi, sweetie."
2939,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[sighs] Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk."
2940,15,14,Liane Cartman,"[sets the groceries on the floor] Oh, what is it this time? [sits down on the sofa]"
2941,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?"
2942,15,14,Liane Cartman,"What, hon?"
2943,15,14,Eric Cartman,"You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!"
2944,15,14,Liane Cartman,"Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can."
2945,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl!"
2946,15,14,Liane Cartman,"Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it."
2947,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[trying to get this straight] We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You can't just sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!"
2948,15,14,Liane Cartman,"Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people."
2949,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!"
2950,15,14,Liane Cartman,Oh. [laughs]
2951,15,14,Eric Cartman,"IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! [runs off]"
2952,15,14,Eric Cartman,My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
2953,15,14,Karen McCormick,"Huh? [calms down] Oh, it's you. [smiles. In the window is Mysterion!] I was wondering when you'd appear. You always come when I'm sad."
2954,15,14,Mysterion,"You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!"
2955,15,14,Karen McCormick,Why did my mommy and daddy go to jail?
2956,15,14,Mysterion,"[thinks a moment] Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late."
2957,15,14,Karen McCormick,But I'm all alone now.
2958,15,14,Mysterion,"You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?"
2959,15,14,Karen McCormick,"I'll try, guardian angel."
2960,15,14,Mysterion,"Don't try, Karen. Do. [the bedroom light comes on]"
2961,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"What in the name of nobody knows are you doing, Karen?! [she looks back at him, then at the window. Mysterion is gone. Mr. Weatherhead goes to the window and looks out to see what Karen was looking at. Failing to see him, he closes the windows and keeps vigil for a bit]"
2962,15,14,Officer 4,"Police man. [starts taking notes] Yes. Yes. Alright, thanks for the tip. We'll check it out. [hangs up] Better call the lieutenant. Looks like we've got another meth lab in town."
2963,15,14,Officer 5,Got any needles on you? Any crack pipes?
2964,15,14,Liane Cartman,"Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while."
2965,15,14,Officer 5,Then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?
2966,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[comes down the stairs in a Hawaiian shirt] What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then. [walks over to the suitcases and grabs the handles] Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away? [turns left and begins to walk out] It's gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now."
2967,15,14,Officer 5,"When will you people learn to lay off the Pabst Blue Ribbon? Now look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."""
2968,15,14,Liane Cartman,"Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
2969,15,14,Mr Adams,"Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services. [sits down, but just as quickly gets up] Here's my head shot. [gives Cartman a picture of himself] I just need to get some information from you if that's okay."
2970,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[sets the picture aside] Yeah, yeah."
2971,15,14,Mr Adams,"Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab."
2972,15,14,Eric Cartman,That's right.
2973,15,14,Mr Adams,"And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here."
2974,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!"
2975,15,14,Mr Adams,"We just - no, we just like to have fun here."
2976,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! [Mr. Adams doesn't look too happy]"
2977,15,14,Mr Adams,"What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?"
2978,15,14,Eric Cartman,A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
2979,15,14,Mr Adams,Could be worse.
2980,15,14,Eric Cartman,How?!
2981,15,14,Mr Adams,"Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?"
2982,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!"
2983,15,14,Mr Adams,[sighs] Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!
2984,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?"
2985,15,14,Officer 6,Hawaii?
2986,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent."
2987,15,14,Officer 7,"Your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of Hawaii."
2988,15,14,Eric Cartman,"What?? [looks out the window. A sign on the side of the road says ""Welcome to Greeley, 'The Exact Opposite of Hawaii"" Please drive safely"" A crow stands on top of the sign] Greeley?"
2989,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Come on now! This is not the way we've told you to tidy up! Remember? Cleanliness is next to godliness, so make it kind of clean but not too much! Amanda! More ambiguous on the dusting! [there's a knock on the door] Kenneth, answer the door! [Kenny gets up and walks to the front door, opens it, and allows Cartman in and closes the door]"
2990,15,14,Eric Cartman,"What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!"
2991,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,(What the fuck are you doing here?!)
2992,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,"Hello Eric, your room is upstairs on the left. Are you hungry?"
2993,15,14,Eric Cartman,You're my new mom?
2994,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,You can call me Mom if you like.
2995,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?"
2996,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"This is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. You will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you WILL follow the agnostic code: We cannot know with certainty if God or Christ exists. They COULD. Then again there COULD be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. Can we be CERTAIN there isn't? NO, so it's pointless to talk about. Now say it with me."
2997,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!"
2998,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"HEY! We do not take the Lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! Do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!"
2999,15,14,Eric Cartman,Oh heell naw! [yells into the hallway] Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! [Mrs. Weatherhead walks in]
3000,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,My name. Is not. Meom!
3001,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean."
3002,15,14,Karen McCormick,"I'll see you at recess, right?"
3003,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,"(I'll be there, Karen.) [Karen walks into her classroom]"
3004,15,14,Eric Cartman,"You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! [Kenny walks up to a group of his new friends]"
3005,15,14,Boy 1,"[with thick wavy hair] Oh hey, Kenny. Who's this?"
3006,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,(This is Eric Cartman.)
3007,15,14,Boy 2,[the tall one] Does he live with you at the foster home?
3008,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[moves past Kenny] Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!"
3009,15,14,Boy 1,"What are you talking about? The poor kid in this school is Jacob Hallery. [Hallery is shown seated on some steps, looking unkempt and eating moldy bread]"
3010,15,14,Eric Cartman,Really?
3011,15,14,Boy 2,"Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job."
3012,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[jumps for joy] YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!

Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school! [runs up to Jacob] 
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!"
3013,15,14,Boy 1,Did he do stuff like this at your old school?
3014,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,(Uh huh.)
3015,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom is so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. [laughs even harder]"
3016,15,14,Greeley Principal,"Eric, at Greeley Elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students."
3017,15,14,Eric Cartman,I wasn't making fun of anybody.
3018,15,14,Greeley Principal,"[reading from a report about the incident] A twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven ""Yo momma so poor"" jokes directed at Jacob Hallery, which ended in a finale with fireworks."
3019,15,14,Eric Cartman,I was just teasing.
3020,15,14,Greeley Principal,"Your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy."
3021,15,14,Eric Cartman,"My case worker? [looks over his shoulder and sees Mr. Adams walk in] Oh, not this guy!"
3022,15,14,Mr Adams,"I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric! But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! I mean, what do you think this is?! The shower room at Penn State?! I'm kidding. We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, I was like, ""What? Is this like the shower room at Penn State?!"" I joke around. This is my head shot. [hands the principal a picture of himself]"
3023,15,14,Eric Cartman,Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
3024,15,14,Mr Adams,"[a few seconds of silence] Oh! Oh, and ""your momma"" jokes are better?! They've been around since the '50s!"
3025,15,14,Greeley Principal,"[exasperated, he pounds both fists on the desk] What the hell does this have to do with anything?!"
3026,15,14,Girl 1,"Principal, you've gotta send help to the playground! They're about to beat up that new kid!"
3027,15,14,Jessica Pinkerton,"Aww, look at the new kid and her wittle dolly. You gonna cry some more in class, wimp?!"
3028,15,14,Boy 3,L-leave her alone.
3029,15,14,Jessica Pinkerton,Shut up! You foster twerps are all the same! Come on! Hand over the doll! [from on high Mysterion drops down in front of Karen] Who the hell is this?!
3030,15,14,Mysterion,How about you find another little girl to pick on?
3031,15,14,Jessica Pinkerton,"Mind your business, Peter Pan! [Mysterion kicks her in the stomach, then gives her a flying punch across the face which leads to a black eye, and punches her again, leading to her falling on her face]"
3032,15,14,Mysterion,[pulling Jessica's head up by her hair] Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! [drops some Chinese fireworks as a distraction while he takes Karen up to the roof.]
3033,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"And if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence, we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence. Nobody knows, nobody can know if any deity is watching over us. Amen."
3034,15,14,Boy 4,Except for Karen's guardian angel.
3035,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,What?
3036,15,14,Melissa (ginger girl),"Where did he take you after he saved you, Karen?"
3037,15,14,Karen McCormick,He just took me back to my classroom. Then he disappeared like always.
3038,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,[pounds the table] What have we told you about making up angel stories?!
3039,15,14,Girl 3,But we SAW him. He leaped down from the sky.
3040,15,14,David (blond boy with glasses),And he kicked the crap out of Jessica Pinkerton. [the other kids begin to chime in]
3041,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,"[moving quickly to the head of the table] Stop it, children! We do not speak such certainties in this house!"
3042,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Get down to the basement, all of you! It's time for the Punishment Room! [Kenny gets angry]"
3043,15,14,David (blond boy with glasses),AAAAAAAH!
3044,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Now, did you see an angel?!"
3045,15,14,David (blond boy with glasses),"No, I - no - I didn't see an angel."
3046,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"No, you can't be certain of that! You might've seen one! [to his wife] Hit him with the Dr Pep-er again. [the wife lets loose the drink once again, then stops] Are there such things as angels?!"
3047,15,14,David (blond boy with glasses),Maybe.
3048,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,Good! [the wife lets loose the drink once again]
3049,15,14,Karen McCormick,"What do we do, Kenny? [Kenny isn't there] Kenny?"
3050,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,What is the meaning of life?!
3051,15,14,David (blond boy with glasses),It's impossible to knoooow!
3052,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"That's right! [a knock is soon heard, and it's persistent]"
3053,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,Who could that be? [the adults go upstairs and to the front door to answer it]
3054,15,14,Mr Adams,"Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?"
3055,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!"
3056,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,What business is that of yours?!
3057,15,14,Mr Adams,It's my business because Child Protective Services is accountable for these kids! [he now talks more calmly] Have I given you my head shot?
3058,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,"Yes, yes, we have that."
3059,15,14,Mr Adams,"Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink?"
3060,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"If we want to serve agnostic beverages in this house, then by Goddish we'll do it! The children you've sent here are undisciplined and talking about the certainty of angels! [a window breaks upstairs and the Weatherheads go up to see where it broke]"
3061,15,14,Mr Adams,"Excuse me! [waits, then sighs] Let's have a look around."
3062,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,What the? Who did this?
3063,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,What is that? [Mysterion turns right and runs down the hallway and into the boys' room. The Weatherheads follow suit and find Mysterion squatting on the window sill. Mysterion drops down and out of view. The Weatherheads reach the window]
3064,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,It was like a... little mystery person... flying around.
3065,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Almost like some kind of... agnostic angel. [notices a note pinned to the outside wall with a knife. He removes the note and reads it. ""Look in the fridge.""]"
3066,15,14,Mr Adams,Oh my God. [David is still dangling from the beam and the other kids are still in the corner by the water heater] What's going on here?
3067,15,14,David (blond boy with glasses),[softly] We don't know... We can't possibly know...
3068,15,14,Mr Adams,"[leans back on the door frame] What have I done? [sits in the doorway with his head in his hands] I took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going! I put innocent children into a dangerous environment! What am I, a recruitment coach for Penn State? [begins to cry. Cartman laughs] It's not funny!"
3069,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"There's nothing in there but Dr Pepper, right? There can't be. [inside is one can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer with a question mark attached to it with a spring. Mrs. Weatherhead opens the door quickly and finds the can]"
3070,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,Ohhh...
3071,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"How did that get here?! [takes the can out, and his wife closes the door] It says it's a Pabst Blue Ribbon."
3072,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,What is it?
3073,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,[opens the can and takes a sip] It's like beer... but different. [hands it to his wife]
3074,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,[takes a sip] But how did it get here? [they begin to take turns sipping the beer.]
3075,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Shut your mouth, bitch!"
3076,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,"You shut your mouth, you filth-fucking asshole!"
3077,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Fuck you, bitch!"
3078,15,14,Greeley Officer 1,"You have the right to remain silent. Now look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."""
3079,15,14,Mrs Weatherhead,I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
3080,15,14,Greeley Officer 2,"Get in the car, you!"
3081,15,14,Mr Weatherhead,"Wait a minute, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble?"
3082,15,14,Mr Adams,"No, no, take all these kids back to their parents! We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of! It's like a Penn State homecoming party! [covers his face and begins to cry. Nearby, Cartman is already in the back seat of a cruiser as a third cop talks to him]"
3083,15,14,Greeley Officer 3,"A false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son."
3084,15,14,Eric Cartman,I'm not saying it.
3085,15,14,Greeley Officer 3,"We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!"
3086,15,14,Eric Cartman,I'm not saying it!
3087,15,14,Greeley Officer 3,Then we'll add another charge for resisting!
3088,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Okay, fine! [turns to the camera] I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!"
3089,15,14,Narrator,"Three arrests in just one power-packed episode, proving once again that we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming... white trash in trouble! Sponsored by Schlitz."
3090,15,14,Stan Marsh,"Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny."
3091,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,"(Thanks, Stan.)"
3092,15,14,Kyle Broflovski,I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
3093,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,(Good for me.)
3094,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[walks up] There he is, there's my buddy."
3095,15,14,Kyle Broflovski,"How was jail, fatass?!"
3096,15,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?

The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-


[a giant reptilian bird's head smashes through the roof and second floor of the school and the kids clear out as the head looks around]"
3097,15,14,Kids,Aaaah! [the beak grabs Kenny and swings him back and forth between the lockers]
3098,15,14,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,"(AAAAHH!) [the bird opens its mouth and swallows Kenny, then flies away. The kids look through the massive hole left by the bird]"
3099,15,14,Stan Marsh,...What the fuck?!
3100,15,14,Eric Cartman,"[begins to cry and walk away while Kyle stares angrily at him] Aww, my mom is so poor she walks down the road with one shoooe. [backs up] And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone."""
