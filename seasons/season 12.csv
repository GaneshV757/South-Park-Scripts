0,12,1,Eric Cartman,AHHHHHH.
1,12,1,Dentist,"Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out."
2,12,1,Eric Cartman,What?
3,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?"
4,12,1,Dentist,"It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!"
5,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!"
6,12,1,Dentist,"Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?"
7,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!"
8,12,1,Dentist,"Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either."
9,12,1,Eric Cartman,...Ice cream?
10,12,1,Dentist,It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.
11,12,1,Liane Cartman,"What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?"
12,12,1,Eric Cartman,Well...you did say free ice cream? [Dentist and Liane laugh]
13,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey."
14,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[Opening his eyes, blinking a lot] Uh. It's over?"
15,12,1,Liane Cartman,"That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!"
16,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[Eyes fully open, sitting up] Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!"
17,12,1,Liane Cartman,"I'm so proud of you, Eric."
18,12,1,Eric Cartman,"All right, so where's my ice cream?"
19,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor."
20,12,1,Eric Cartman,"You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!"
21,12,1,Doctor,"No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus."
22,12,1,Liane Cartman,...What!?
23,12,1,Eric Cartman,What's that supposed to mean?!
24,12,1,Doctor,During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.
25,12,1,Eric Cartman,I HAVE AIDS?
26,12,1,Doctor,"Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry."
27,12,1,Eric Cartman,"""SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!"
28,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, my poor little baby!"
29,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!"
30,12,1,Liane Cartman,Oh God! [Cries] Oh no!
31,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!"
32,12,1,Doctor,"We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream. [One of the doctors brings over a plate with two sundaes on it, leaving it on Cartman's bed.]"
33,12,1,Eric Cartman,[Knocks the ice cream on the ground] Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
34,12,1,Liane Cartman,"[Sobbing] Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!"
35,12,1,Eric Cartman,NO! NOOOOOOOO!
36,12,1,Principal Victoria,"Thank you for coming, everyone. [Stan, Kyle, Butters and Kenny walk in.]"
37,12,1,Principal Victoria,"Boys, please take a seat."
38,12,1,Stan Marsh,[The boys sit down.] What's going on? Are we in trouble?
39,12,1,Principal Victoria,"Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV."
40,12,1,Stan Marsh,[All five boys are surprised.] ...What?
41,12,1,Butters Stotch,Oh no.
42,12,1,Doctor 2,"He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared."
43,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman has HIV?
44,12,1,Doctor 2,"We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-"
45,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
46,12,1,Principal Victoria,"All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?"
47,12,1,Mr Mackey,"[Opens the back door] Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say ""Hi"", m'kay? [Eric walks into the room with a black baseball cap, a gray scarf, and an annoyed look. Everyone greets him.]"
48,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,...No. Way.
49,12,1,Butters Stotch,"[Walks over to Cartman, putting an arm around his shoulder] How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. [Smiles and kisses Cartman on the cheek, much to his horror]"
50,12,1,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, this sucks ass!"
51,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. [Leaves the room and begins laughing in the hallway. It can be heard from in the room.]"
52,12,1,Butters Stotch,Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
53,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!"
54,12,1,Doctor 2,"No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-"
55,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!"
56,12,1,M C,"We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV. [there's hardly anyone there: just his mom, Butters, Jimmy, and two other adults.]"
57,12,1,Eric Cartman,Where the hell is everybody? [a waitress arrives with some food]
58,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?"
59,12,1,Waitress,This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.
60,12,1,Butters Stotch,"Great benefit, Eric!"
61,12,1,Jimmy Valmer,The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
62,12,1,Eric Cartman,So this is it?
63,12,1,Waitress,I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now. [leaves]
64,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!"
65,12,1,M C,"With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman."
66,12,1,Eric Cartman,Just bring out Elton John already!
67,12,1,M C,"Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit."
68,12,1,Waitress,"It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!"
69,12,1,Eric Cartman,Jimmy Buffett?!
70,12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
AIDSburger in paradise!
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!"
71,12,1,Eric Cartman,Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
72,12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"A little boy in South Park
Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue.
Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff
How are we all feelin' tonight?"
73,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[sticks his middle finger up in the air] Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!"
74,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice."
75,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!"
76,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday."
77,12,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot."
78,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease."
79,12,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?"
80,12,1,Eric Cartman,"...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead. [Kyle bursts out laughing; Cartman angrily approaches him] Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!"
81,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[trying to stop laughing long enough to say something] I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly."
82,12,1,Eric Cartman,No you don't!
83,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,I do. [smiles and keeps from laughing]
84,12,1,Eric Cartman,"If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face! [the smirk is having trouble not breaking into a laugh] Well any God damned second, Kyle!"
85,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry. I gotta go home. [laughs, turns away and leaves. His laughter trails off]"
86,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[watched Kyle leave] Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!"
87,12,1,Stan Marsh,"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic."
88,12,1,Eric Cartman,Ironic how?
89,12,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now..."
90,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[spins around and gets in Stan's face] Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!"
91,12,1,Stan Marsh,"[backs away a bit] Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks."
92,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[advances] Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!"
93,12,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, uh-okay, it's clear."
94,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[comes into view also dressed as a cat burglar] All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. [they head towards the sliding door]"
95,12,1,Butters Stotch,"Okay, but... what are you going to do?"
96,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at."
97,12,1,Butters Stotch,I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
98,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do."
99,12,1,Butters Stotch,"I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?"
100,12,1,Eric Cartman,"I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive."
101,12,1,Butters Stotch,"[reflects on the answer] Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true."
102,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[gets down to business] All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access."
103,12,1,Butters Stotch,"Wow, you really know what you're doing."
104,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times. [moments later, Cartman is shown moving up along the outer wall to Kyle's window. He stops and opens the window gingerly, silently steps onto Kyle's bed, and walks over to Kyle's face. Then he whispers] You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well... [reaches into his back pack, pulls out a syringe, rolls up the sleeves on his left arm and...] let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. [...draws some blood into it and drops the blood into Kyle's mouth. Kyle instinctively tastes it and swallows it. Cartman quickly goes back out the window and slams it shut as Kyle wakes up.]"
105,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Wagh.
106,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"There there, bubbe, you'll be okay. [a doctor walks into the room] Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?"
107,12,1,Dr Doctor,"No, it isn't strep..."
108,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, well there's a relief."
109,12,1,Dr Doctor,"...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?"
110,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"No, why?"
111,12,1,Dr Doctor,"[walks around to Kyle's end of the bed] Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?"
112,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What? No?!
113,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Doctor, what are you saying?"
114,12,1,Dr Doctor,[walks up to Sheila] We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
115,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?
116,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,HIV?
117,12,1,Dr Doctor,"It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt."
118,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"No, that's impossible!"
119,12,1,Dr Doctor,"[addresses Kyle] Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?"
120,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe... [his eyes open wide at the realization] Oh my God. That son of a bitch! [hops off the bed and rushes out the door]"
121,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle? Kyle!
122,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Pass me the ball! [Kyle runs in from a distance...] Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole! [...and shoves Cartman forward at full speed. Cartman falls on his face, then looks back at Kyle.] Kyle, what the F?!"
123,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!"
124,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, what?!"
125,12,1,Stan Marsh,[steps into view] What did he do?
126,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why do I have HIV?!
127,12,1,Clyde Donovan,...Oh...
128,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?"
129,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What did you do?!
130,12,1,Eric Cartman,Nothing!
131,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! [Behind Cartman, Butters motions Kyle not to say anything further]"
132,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. [too late. Butters stops motioning]"
133,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
134,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-"
135,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[lunges at Cartman] AAAAAAA! [start punching him mercilessly]
136,12,1,Eric Cartman,Kyle!
137,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[doesn't let up] Here you go! [punch] Here you go! [punch. Mr. Mackey walks into the fray]
138,12,1,Mr Mackey,"Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?! [tries to separate the boys...] Break it up! Hm'kay?! [...but ends up hoisting them away together at each other's throats] M'kay!"
139,12,1,Principal Victoria,"All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?"
140,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[pointing to Cartman] He gave me AIDS!
141,12,1,Principal Victoria,What?
142,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
143,12,1,Principal Victoria,"Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?"
144,12,1,Eric Cartman,Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
145,12,1,Principal Victoria,"[pointedly] Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!"
146,12,1,Eric Cartman,[grudgingly] Kind of.
147,12,1,Mr Mackey,"Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!"
148,12,1,Principal Victoria,That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
149,12,1,Eric Cartman,[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
150,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,An apology?!
151,12,1,Principal Victoria,"You're sorry for what, Eric?"
152,12,1,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle."
153,12,1,Principal Victoria,"That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling."
154,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[can't believe these adults] ...What?!
155,12,1,Mr Mackey,"Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?"
156,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
157,12,1,Eric Cartman,See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. [they are shown the door]
158,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[keeping pace with Kyle] Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now? [stops] Kyle, where are you going?"
159,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around and returns to Cartman, then says between gritted teeth] I'm going to break everything that you own! [spins around and walks away]"
160,12,1,Eric Cartman,"What's that supposed to mean? Kyle? [settles on the obvious] Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!"
161,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole! [Kyle enters Cartman's room and begins breaking anything he sees. First, a toy rocket. Then, he grabs a poster of Braveheart from the wall and rips it apart. Next, he grabs the Wellington Bear Magic Mic and smashes it on the floor. Cartman walks in.] What the fuck are you doing?! [picks up some of his broken toys. Kyle knocks over a box of small toys] Kyle, stop it! [Kyle breaks apart a toy Mountie after three tries] God damn it, don't! [Kyle walks over to Cartman's big toy box, grabs Clyde Frog,..] Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone! [...and rips its head right off and moves off.] NO!! [Cartman picks up the two halves of his plush frog as Kyle moves to the XBOX] AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle! [Kyle picks it up and tries to pull it out of the power socket] Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND! [stops Kyle before Kyle gets to smash the XBOX on the floor] I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!"
162,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"There is no cure, you asshole!"
163,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope."
164,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What hope?!
165,12,1,Eric Cartman,Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
166,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,You're lying!
167,12,1,Eric Cartman,"NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson."
168,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Magic Johnson?
169,12,1,Eric Cartman,He was a basketball player.
170,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,So what?!
171,12,1,Eric Cartman,"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy. [grabs Kyle's shoulder] You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!"
172,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at the XBOX for a few moments, then] You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!"
173,12,1,Eric Cartman,[stunned] My God...
174,12,1,Eric Cartman,We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
175,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,"Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each."
176,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS."
177,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,"...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats."
178,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!"
179,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!"
180,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,"Oh, you boys are [sticks his left index finger into a tube he makes with his right hand and moves it in and out of the tube] like that, huh?"
181,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,NO!
182,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
183,12,1,Eric Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive."
184,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,"Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?"
185,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! [turns around and leaves Kyle standing there]"
186,12,1,Flight Attendant,We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?
187,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh uh, you know, all over cancer."
188,12,1,Flight Attendant,I'm so sorry
189,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, at least [leans into the aisle and looks back at the other passengers] it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease."
190,12,1,Flight Attendant,"Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer."
191,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here! [the flight attendant turns and walks away] We're on our way, buddy. [puts his left hand on Kyle's right hand] Magic Johnson, here we come."
192,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Don't. Touch me.
193,12,1,Eric Cartman,[removes his hand from Kyle's and places his hands together over his stomach] I know. I'm scared too.
194,12,1,Magic's Butler,"Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. [Magic sheds a big tear and sniffs]"
195,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[moments later] Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease."
196,12,1,Magic Johnson,You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?
197,12,1,Eric Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive."
198,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[quickly irritated] Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
199,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, we need to try to find a-"
200,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
201,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[thinks for a few seconds] I don't think it's funny, Kyle."
202,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive! [Cartman keeps quiet] This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!"
203,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[clears his throat] Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-"
204,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
205,12,1,Eric Cartman,[waits a second] Are you sure?
206,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[quickly] Yes!!
207,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[waits a second] Are you HIV-positive? [Kyle smacks him] Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!"
208,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't. [shrugs]"
209,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
210,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Well, not at all."
211,12,1,Magic Johnson,"The pool is over there [motions to his left], where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen [motions to his right] is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all."
212,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
213,12,1,Magic Johnson,Sure.
214,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom. [before them is the four-post bed with curtains, and stacks of dollar bills everywhere else]"
215,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude.
216,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money."
217,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,You sleep with money. Every night?
218,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?"
219,12,1,Scientist 1,"[changes focus] It's incredible. Mitch, these boys could be onto something. Take a look. [Mitch steps in and looks into the microscope] That's a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right? [the HIV is indeed attacking] All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash. [waves a brick of bills around near the microscope]"
220,12,1,Mitch and AIDS Research Scientists,"My God. The HIV particles are receding! [the particles scream as they sense the money, and leave the white blood cells alone]"
221,12,1,Scientist 1,The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.
222,12,1,Scientist 2,"Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it."
223,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe..."
224,12,1,Mitch and AIDS Research Scientists,Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.
225,12,1,Magic Johnson,I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!
226,12,1,Scientist 2,"Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!"
227,12,1,Magic Johnson,These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen. [genuflects next to them] Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.
228,12,1,Scientist 2,"[sighs heavily and puts his hands on a lab table] Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure."
229,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[looks away] Wugh.
230,12,1,Scientist 2,I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.
231,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk."
232,12,1,Mitch and AIDS Research Scientists,"Let's hope to Christ this works. [...walks over to Kyle, kneels next to him, and injects him with the liquid. Moments later, a sample of Kyle's blood is taken and analyzed]"
233,12,1,Scientist 1,"Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look! [he trades places with Scientist 2, who looks into the microscope] The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood! [the newly repaired blood cells look like discs cut out of dollar bills. Scientist 1 turns around and faces the boys.] Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS."
234,12,1,Eric Cartman,All right!
235,12,1,Scientist 1,[throws open the lab doors and walks out] They found the cure for AIDS! [runs down the hall] The cure for AIDS!
236,12,1,Scientist 3,What is it?
237,12,1,Scientist 1,[grabs Scientist 3 by the shoulders] Large doses of concentrated cash! [runs down the hall] Get the media on the phone!
238,12,1,Scientist 4,[female] All right!
239,12,1,Anchorman,Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS. [smiles] About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.
240,12,1,Driver in Nigeria,Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
241,12,1,M C,"I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman. [the room applauds. Most everyone present is from South Park] Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds [Kyle's face gets angry], these two brave friends-"
242,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
243,12,1,M C,"These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys [Cartman grins. Kyle is still angry], here is... Jimmy Buffett!"
244,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[grin vanishing] What?! Aw, no!"
245,12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"Cureburger in paradise!
Cureburger. There I said it twice!"
246,12,1,Eric Cartman,"What?! Aw, God damn it! [puts his arm around Kyle] Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha."
247,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,I'm still breaking your Xbox. [turns right and walks off]
248,12,1,Eric Cartman,"What? No. No. [runs after him] Kyle, no!"
249,12,2,Announcer,"Live, from Chicago, Illinois, it's Decision 2008."
250,12,2,Moderator,[in a droning voice] Good evening and welcome to the political debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. [turns to them] First question: How do you see yourself as different from your opponent?
251,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?"
252,12,2,Randy Marsh,"This is important, Stanley! [the boys look at him] You boys should care about this stuff."
253,12,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but we totally don't."
254,12,2,Randy Marsh,Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
255,12,2,Moderator,"And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending?"
256,12,2,Barack Obama,"Well, my opinion is that-"
257,12,2,Announcer,"We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch! [a montage of Britney pictures is stamped with a stamp saying ""Britney Watch"" inside it. Dramatic background music starts up] Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!"
258,12,2,Butters Stotch,[wakes up and looks at the screen] Man...
259,12,2,Randy Marsh,"[getting excited, leans forward] Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?"
260,12,2,Anchorman,"Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more."
261,12,2,Robert Pooner,"Ron, I'm standing in South Mark, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. [the boys react to the news]"
262,12,2,Eric Cartman,"Aw dude, that's our town!"
263,12,2,Robert Pooner,"Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground [shots of her pitching a tent and relaxing in a chair after the tent is up], and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend. [a shot of her squatting and pissing on the ladybug. The blurred area is her face]"
264,12,2,Randy Marsh,She's such a train wreck!
265,12,2,Robert Pooner,"When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused. [extreme closeup of the piss hitting the ladybug]"
266,12,2,Ron,"[the anchorman] This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight."
267,12,2,Robert Pooner,"That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits! [a closeup of her chin shows two zits]"
268,12,2,Butters Stotch,"Aw, poor girl."
269,12,2,Randy Marsh,"[rising from his armchair] Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. [heads towards the kitchen]"
270,12,2,Ron,"The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado [a photo of Brian Willis holding lots of bricks of money appears], who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars."
271,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,A hundred thousand dollars?
272,12,2,Eric Cartman,That's enough to buy slaves!
273,12,2,Ron,Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.
274,12,2,Hillary Clinton,...and spearchuckers.
275,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,[gets off the sofa] Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
276,12,2,Stan Marsh,[gets off the sofa] And she's at a hotel in our town. [Cartman gets up as well and gets restless]
277,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera."
278,12,2,Eric Cartman,[runs off] Sweet!
279,12,2,Butters Stotch,"[finally gets up] Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone."
280,12,2,Stan Marsh,"[thinks a bit, then] Butters, don't be such a pussy."
281,12,2,Butters Stotch,"[looks at Stan, then at Kyle] Hokay. [smiles]"
282,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
283,12,2,Butters Stotch,"[hidden, comes to the front] Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! [something stops them in their tracks]"
284,12,2,Stan Marsh,Oh no.
285,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!"
286,12,2,Photographer 1,Join the club.
287,12,2,Photographer 2,"Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!"
288,12,2,Eric Cartman,"We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! [the boys make it through the crowd and approach a set of stairs. A security guard stops them]"
289,12,2,Guard,"Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs."
290,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[stammers] We uh, we have special permission?"
291,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids."
292,12,2,Guard,You are?
293,12,2,Butters Stotch,[not amused] Not me! I'm a squirrel!
294,12,2,Britney Spears,But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo- [several knocks are heard at her door]
295,12,2,Guard,"Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel."
296,12,2,Britney Spears,My boys? Really? Send them in. [to the caller] It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now. [hangs up. Stan and the others enter the room]
297,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,We did it guys!
298,12,2,Stan Marsh,I told you that would work!
299,12,2,The Boys,"Yehehahah, all right!"
300,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Ahall right!
301,12,2,Britney Spears,"[walks up to them] You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?"
302,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"All right. Butters, go get next to her."
303,12,2,Butters Stotch,I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
304,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?"
305,12,2,Britney Spears,"[walks back to the table] You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?"
306,12,2,Butters Stotch,It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! [Britney opens a drawer and pulls something out]
307,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!"
308,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else."
309,12,2,Eric Cartman,"[aims his camera] All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'."
310,12,2,Britney Spears,I've got a better idea.
311,12,2,Stan Marsh,You do?
312,12,2,Britney Spears,"Yeah. [whips out a big shotgun, shoves the nozzle into her mouth, and pulls the trigger]"
313,12,2,Stan Marsh,"NO! [the gun goes off and she falls to the ground. The gun falls away from her. All four boys stand there, stunned and speechless. Cartman does not take any pictures. After a bit, Cartman turns and runs out. Butters looks at Stan and Kyle, then heads for the door]"
314,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"NO! [the gun goes off and she falls to the ground. The gun falls away from her. All four boys stand there, stunned and speechless. Cartman does not take any pictures. After a bit, Cartman turns and runs out. Butters looks at Stan and Kyle, then heads for the door]"
315,12,2,Butters Stotch,[stops and looks back] You killed her! [leaves]
316,12,2,Guard,"Hey, everything all right u-. Oh."
317,12,2,Nurse,"[over the PA system] Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? [another nurse wheels an elderly patient across the hall]"
318,12,2,Stan Marsh,We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
319,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
320,12,2,Doctor,[walks up to Stan and Kyle and faces them] She's... alive.
321,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Whew.
322,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, thank God."
323,12,2,Doctor,"But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?"
324,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?"
325,12,2,Doctor,I don't want you making her upset.
326,12,2,Stan Marsh,"We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry."
327,12,2,Doctor,[sighs] All right.
328,12,2,Doctor,"[enters with Stan and Kyle] Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something. [Britney gargles something. Only her lower jaw and the base of her skull remain of her head]"
329,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God!
330,12,2,Stan Marsh,Oh no!
331,12,2,Doctor,"[by Britney's side] The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney. [glares at Stan and Kyle] Right, boys?!"
332,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. [Britney gargles something back. The boys join the doctor at her side]"
333,12,2,Doctor,"Well, I'll let you boys have your say. [walks off. Britney gargles something]"
334,12,2,Stan Marsh,"[his voice shaking] Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself."
335,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, God, what have we done?!"
336,12,2,Announcer,It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
337,12,2,ET Reporter,"[outside Denver Medical Center, with photographers swarming the area] You won't believe what Britney's done now. The troubled pop star has just been spotted with a crazy ""no top part of my head"" look. This video [shown as he speaks] was taken just hours ago as Britney was wheeled into the hospital for some reason. And if we zoom in on the footage, right, ri-right here [the camera zooms in on the left breast], you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past."
338,12,2,Anchorman,"O ho ho, oh houch, that's gotta be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical ""no top of the head"" look?"
339,12,2,Chris,"No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out."
340,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[he and Stan are blinded by the flash] Dude! [the doctor reaches the curtains and closes them, but the flashes don't stop going off]"
341,12,2,Doctor,"Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!"
342,12,2,Manager,"Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager. [sees her in bed] Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this."
343,12,2,Britney Spears,Guglo.
344,12,2,Manager,"Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that."
345,12,2,Paparazzo,"Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly. [Britney instinctively raises her left arm to shield her eyes from the camera, though she has no eyes now]"
346,12,2,Doctor,Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.
347,12,2,Britney Spears,"Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her?"
348,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, of course. [begins to help out]"
349,12,2,Manager,"[softly] Okay, come on! [leads the boys and Britney out] My car is right here. [opens the door and gets in. The photographers are within earshot...]"
350,12,2,Photographer 3,Hey look!
351,12,2,Photographer 4,There she is! [A photographer points and his face becomes distorted. The photographers rush the car before the manager can leave]
352,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh crap! [the photographers again clamor for Britney's attention, and one of them asks about her choice of shoes]"
353,12,2,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
354,12,2,Manager,"Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time. [to the photographers] Thank you! Yes, thanks. [drives out of the crowd and peels away. The paparazzi look on and then pursue the car on foot]"
355,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can."
356,12,2,Manager,"That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away."
357,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
358,12,2,Manager,"All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it."
359,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?"
360,12,2,Sound Engineer,"All right, Brit, let's try it from the top. [a studio hand gives her some headphones to work with, and she holds them up against what would be her right ear. She gargles intermittently]"
361,12,2,Female Aide,"God, what a train wreck."
362,12,2,Male Aide,She must be stoned again. [Britney continues to gargle more often and longer]
363,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse."
364,12,2,Manager,"Whattaya mean? She sounds great. [suddenly stops the music] Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be ""love elation"". Sounds more like you're saying ""love creation""."
365,12,2,Britney Spears,Gogehah.
366,12,2,Manager,E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.
367,12,2,Britney Spears,Egeul-gageol
368,12,2,Sound Engineer,"Gah, she's so stupid."
369,12,2,Stan Marsh,What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
370,12,2,Sound Engineer,"I know. She's really dumb, huh? [smiles]"
371,12,2,Stan Marsh,"No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!"
372,12,2,Sound Engineer,"[cups his hands like he's grabbing Britney] Yeah. And she's all fat, too."
373,12,2,Britney Spears,Okel?
374,12,2,Announcer,"Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards"
375,12,2,VJ,"What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears! [two stage hands walk Britney out on stage]"
376,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw come on now, people! [the manager is pleased with the performance]"
377,12,2,Woman,"Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. [the song begins: ""It's Britney, bitch!"" Britney is waiting for her cue as dancers swirl around her. She begins to warble, and it echoes. She walks and immediately a dancer keeps her from falling.]"
378,12,2,Singers,"The way she fee-els. [Britney leans over, and another dancer stands her up again. She warbles some more] Love inside."
379,12,2,Elderly Man,"Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing."
380,12,2,Stan Marsh,[annoyed] She doesn't have any lips!
381,12,2,Singers,Temporary. [Britney warbles some more. Two male dancers come by and turn her around so the camera can focus on her ass] So hot! [a few moments she gets a solo segment and four male dancers fawn over her]
382,12,2,ET Reporter,"Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues."
383,12,2,Manager,"Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow. [walks over to the door and opens it. The paparazzi is there, piled on from floor to ceiling] Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. [leaves, closing the door. No paparazzi get in. Once the place is silent, she sits back on her armchair and relaxes with a sigh. Stan and Kyle can only look on]"
384,12,2,Stan Marsh,"We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace."
385,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?"
386,12,2,Stan Marsh,[strokes his chin and takes a few steps forward] I know where.
387,12,2,Stan Marsh,We want three tickets to the North Pole. [the clerk stops what he's doing and looks around]
388,12,2,Clerk,The North Pole? [leaves his chair and walks to the window] Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
389,12,2,Stan Marsh,"We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. [Kyle and Britney stand behind him. Britney is wearing a wig, sunglasses, and hat as a disguise]"
390,12,2,Announcer,[breathless] It's Britney Wowtch!
391,12,2,Ron,A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise! [a shot of Stan and Kyle leading Britney down the street]
392,12,2,Robert Pooner,"Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe. [the camera zooms in on her crotch to show what looks like a camel's toe under her shorts]"
393,12,2,Ron,"Oooooh, ouch!"
394,12,2,Anchorwoman,"Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense."
395,12,2,Leslie,"Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with that kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads."
396,12,2,Ron,"[grunts a little] Eh, David, any idea as to how big the camel toe actually was? [a shot of Britney and a camel toe together]"
397,12,2,Robert Pooner,"She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet."
398,12,2,Ron,Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.
399,12,2,Tracy,[a picture of Butters being dragged towards an animal control truck] The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation.
400,12,2,Ron,"Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts."
401,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station."
402,12,2,Paparazzo,[behind the boys] There she is! It's Britney! [more photographers show up and begin to take pictures]
403,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh no. [he and Kyle quickly whisk Britney away, the photographers hot on their tails. They pass a room whose door is slightly open. Seconds later they return to it, go in, and shut the door]"
404,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, they're never gonna let us through."
405,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yes they are! I have an idea.
406,12,2,Paparazzo 2,Britney? Where'd she go?
407,12,2,Paparazzo 3,"There she is! [Kyle appears wearing Britney's disguise. He turns to look at the paparazzi, then runs away. The paparazzi start taking pictures and following him. He runs down the street, the paparazzi pursue him]"
408,12,2,Stan Marsh,"It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. [Britney gargles something]"
409,12,2,Manager,"There she is. Hey Britney, it's me. [Kyle ignores him and keeps running. He joins the paparazzi in chasing ""Britney"" down. Kyle runs through a park; they're right behnd him. Kyle runs into a garden full of statues, stops, and turns around] Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?"
410,12,2,ET Reporter,"Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!"
411,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[takes off the sunglasses] I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!"
412,12,2,Paparazzo 5,"Ooo, psych!"
413,12,2,Manager,She must be back at the train station; come on! [they turn around and go back]
414,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute! [the group turns around. Kyle drops the sunglasses] Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?"
415,12,2,Paparazzo 6,"[steps forward] Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die."
416,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,[quizzically] Huh? [thunder starts rolling in the distance]
417,12,2,Paparazzo 7,What do you think all this effort has been for?
418,12,2,Manager,[a sinister smile crosses his face] It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.
419,12,2,Officer,She must... die.
420,12,2,Background Singers,Hetus. Alte omnebus. [the photographers begins to join in] Virtu e poquebus. [other adults join in this nonsensical Latin chant]
421,12,2,Narrator,"Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole."
422,12,2,Stan Marsh,"You doing okay, Ms. Spears? [she gargles. From the train's cab, the conductor looks back at Britney and Stan through the cab door's window]"
423,12,2,Conductor,"[on the phone] It's her. Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears; [looks at a photo] it looks just like the picture. [the photo he holds is that of a camel's toe, not of Britney] You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand. [begins chanting] Rectus. Hoc honebus"
424,12,2,Elderly Man,"Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town."
425,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
426,12,2,Bob Summers,"Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?"
427,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,NO!
428,12,2,Paparazzo 8,"Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice."
429,12,2,Bob Summers,"In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die."
430,12,2,Paparazzo 9,"We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times."
431,12,2,Paparazzo 1,Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.
432,12,2,Canadian Paparazzo,It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death.
433,12,2,Woman,Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
434,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
435,12,2,Elderly Man,"Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest."
436,12,2,Paparazzo 11,"All right, everyone's about here."
437,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,[bewildered] Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
438,12,2,Male passenger,"Hey, where are we? This isn't right. [Stan looks out the window quickly. Outside is an empty field, but a horde of photographers race through it and reach the train, clamoring for her attention and ready to take pictures]"
439,12,2,Stan Marsh,Oh no!
440,12,2,Britney Spears,Ohhh thoooo!
441,12,2,Stan Marsh,"[hops down and grabs Britney's hand] Come on, Britney! [pulls her out the opposite side and into the field] Come on, come on! [as they run, Kyle's hat falls away. They reach the end of the field and enter a clearing. They look around and find themselves surrounded. All sorts of people are there, not just paparazzi. The escape route they just used is closed off by more spectators. Stan looks around and some faces are recognizable, like Irene. Sheila and Gerald show up]"
442,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad! [runs up to them] They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?"
443,12,2,Gerald Broflovski,"It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy."
444,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Be a good boy? You know all about this?
445,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?"
446,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!"
447,12,2,Stan Marsh,Sacrificed? For what?
448,12,2,Randy Marsh,"For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it."
449,12,2,Canadian Paparazzo,"Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch."
450,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Corn harvest!
451,12,2,Randy Marsh,"We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest."
452,12,2,Stan Marsh,"All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!"
453,12,2,Manager,The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
454,12,2,Paparazzo 12,Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.
455,12,2,Farmer,And harvest is coming soon.
456,12,2,Bob Summers,"All right, folks, let's finish this quickly. [everyone whips out a camera and starts taking pictures, closing in on Britney all the while]"
457,12,2,Stan Marsh,"No wait. [Britney groans. People get close, take pictures, then make way for more people]"
458,12,2,Woman 2,"Come on, hurry up."
459,12,2,Woman 3,"[obese] I can't run. You go ahead, I'll catch up with ya. [the barrage of picture-taking continues. The McCormicks come up to take pictures. Britney drops to the ground, sort of pleading to be left alone]"
460,12,2,Mother,"Here Davey. [hands a camera to her son. The barrage continues, with Randy, Liane, other familiar faces... Britney wilts under the lights and finally lies down completely]"
461,12,2,Bob Summers,[throws out his arms] Hold on. [a doctor walks up and checks for vital signs]
462,12,2,Doctor,She's dead.
463,12,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. [everyone turns and goes off in different directions under a windy and thunderous sky. Stan is left alone staring at Britney's corpse. Kyle is a little further away, but he too looks at the corpse]"
464,12,2,Gil,Mornin' Bill.
465,12,2,Bill and Gill,Mornin' Gil.
466,12,2,Gil,[inspecting some yellow corn] Nice-lookin' corn.
467,12,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh? [begins to check out the corn as well. Sharon puts some corn into her shopping cart]"
468,12,2,Randy Marsh,An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
469,12,2,ET Reporter,"[on TV screens throughout the store] She's the daughter of a country singer, and the young girl has really taken the country by storm. Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus, though only fifteen years old, is already on her way to being a major superstar."
470,12,2,Jimbo Kern,"[near the beginning of the report] Hey, check it out! [the report ends and ominous music begins]"
471,12,2,Randy Marsh,"[glued to the screen] Looks like next harvest will be even better. [begins to chant. The other shoppers join in, then Sheila, and finally, Stan and Kyle. The image of the ET reporter and Miley stays onscreen]"
472,12,3,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it ""The Choking Game"", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?"
473,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You can get high from choking yourself? [Kenny feels for his neck through his hood, then squeezes once he finds it]"
474,12,3,Mr Mackey,"Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?"
475,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee."
476,12,3,Eric Cartman,Cat pee? [Kenny lets up and then tries to choke himself again]
477,12,3,Stan Marsh,"That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?"
478,12,3,Mr Mackey,"Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay? [Kenny is trying really hard to choke himself] Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad."
479,12,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine. [Mr. Kitty meows] Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? [Mr. Kitty meows]"
480,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,You guys are wasting your time.
481,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, this is not gonna work."
482,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, ready Kenny?"
483,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(All set.)
484,12,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, bring out...! The other male cat. [Kyle walks to a pet carrier, opens the door, pulls out a brown striped cat, and places it on the coffee table opposite Mr. Kitty. The two cats meow at each other first, then growl at each other. After a short while, Mr. Kitty shoots concentrated piss into Kenny's face]"
485,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Ow.)
486,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! [Kenny staggers backwards. The other guys gather round him]
487,12,3,Stan Marsh,Do you feel anything?
488,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? [Kenny's not responding. His mind is elsewhere...]"
489,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hey cool! Check it out!)
490,12,3,Girl 2's Father,I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.
491,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeahhh!)
492,12,3,Girl 2's Father,Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
493,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Okay.) [follows her towards the fountain. At the fountain's edge, she undresses, then he begins to undress]"
494,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[through Kenny's hallucination] Kenny! Kenny, wake up! [In the middle of town, Cartman is stopping Kenny from disrobing any further] Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!"
495,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(What?) [opens his eyes and looks around] (Where'd she go?) [stands up and pulls up his pants.]
496,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls."
497,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(You fucking asshole!)
498,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?"
499,12,3,Kenny McCormick,[Punching Cartman] (What the fuck did you do that for?)
500,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle come up to restrain Kenny]"
501,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!"
502,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"[walks away from them a bit, mad] (Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)"
503,12,3,Stan Marsh,What titties?
504,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"[turns around] (The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)"
505,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering."
506,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes."
507,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(I almost... touched them.)
508,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore."
509,12,3,Announcer,"Next on FOX News! [SPECIAL REPORT: FOX NEWS] It's the newest drug craze. and it's killing your kids! [""killing your kids"" appears over scenes of kids falling over]"
510,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Killing our kids? [leans forward]
511,12,3,Reporter,"All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine! [two women have their cats face off, and one of them gets concentrated urine on her face. She laughs] Huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state [the affected woman moved her arms up and open, then freezes as her eyes get unfocused] and is also referred to as... cheesing. [Letters cut out into cheese shapes appear: ""CHEESING"". Cut to the front of J. Brown Elementary School, day.] Why ""cheesing""? Because it's ""fon to due"". [the words appear onscreen. Cut to a girl's silhouette] This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months."
512,12,3,Girl 2's Father,"[in a deep, electronically-altered voice] We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long."
513,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
514,12,3,Reporter,"So how can you tell if your child is cheesing? [some graphics begin to appear]

1. Your child seems distant, preoccupied.
2. Your child's face smells like cat urine.
3. When you see tigers at the zoo, your child starts grinding his or her teeth.


You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as ""Hey, let's go cheese."" or ""Do you feel like cheesing, guys?"" or ""Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now."""
515,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,[now standing next to Gerald] Kids are doing this?
516,12,3,Reporter,"Kids do it because it's legal. [a teen boy looks at the camera with a fierce face. A skull and crossbones appear over it] What can you do before it's too late? [a picture of a cat switches with its negative for a strobe effect a few times, then ends with the negative and an echoing meow]"
517,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"We have to protect our children from this, Sheila."
518,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as ""the cheese game"", or ""vitamin cheese"", or ""Mary Jane piss in your face fun time"". Cheesing is spreading fast."
519,12,3,Sharon Marsh,"[stands up] All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?"
520,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
521,12,3,Stephen Stotch,"[stands up] Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!"
522,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!"
523,12,3,Randy Marsh,[stands up again] Let's hear it for Gerald!
524,12,3,Stephen Stotch,[stands up again] Hooray for Gerald! [the rest of the audience begins to cheer and argue]
525,12,3,Craig s sister,No! No!
526,12,3,Agent 1,"Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie. [walks off with the cat] Jeez... [Two other agents leave another house with a cat]"
527,12,3,Girl 2 s Father,"Goodbye, Scrambles. [his daughter cries into his left pant leg] We'll miss you. [nearby, the cats are tossed into the DEA vans and taken away]"
528,12,3,Agent 2,Got two here.
529,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hey! What the hell are you doing?!)
530,12,3,Agent 1,"Sorry, these are illegal."
531,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(What?! No! What are you doing?!) [the agents toss the cats into the van] (You fuckers!) [the van drives off.]
532,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off. [the agents soon leave, and Cartman walks up to the dim attic with a small book] Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now. [drops the book in front of the cat] Here. Write a diary."
533,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, have you seen Kenny?"
534,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today."
535,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys... [Cartman and Stan turn to listen] I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing."
536,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is."
537,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed."
538,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, who has cats these days? [laughs nervously]"
539,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now."
540,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)
541,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny? [pounds three more times]
542,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Kenny, you home? [Kenny yells some more. Alarmed, the boys open the door and enter the house. They see that Kenny was indeed cheesing. Two cats look back at them.]"
543,12,3,Kenny McCormick,[really high] (Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) [one cat runs out]
544,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny!
545,12,3,Kenny McCormick,[still cheering and making flying motions] (Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)
546,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! [Kenny flutters some more, stops, and passes out, falling to the floor]"
547,12,3,Stan Marsh,Kenny!
548,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny!
549,12,3,Butters Stotch,"There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken."
550,12,3,Kenny McCormick,[groans]
551,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, we need to have a serious talk."
552,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"(No we don't, guys.)"
553,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life."
554,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)"
555,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! [abruptly, Kenny vomits, stops, then vomits again. Some of it gets on Butters' face and shirt.]"
556,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out."
557,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you."
558,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"[exhausted] (Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)"
559,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?"
560,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[grabs the other cat as it walks up to him] We've gotta keep this away from him.
561,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[sits up] Mr. Kitty, shhh! [Mr. Kitty meows a 3rd time] Damn it! [gets up and leaves the bed. A small door to the attic opens and Cartman pops in with a candle. Mr. Kitty is nearby] Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you. [Mr. Kitty goes to a window and meows. Cartman follows him to the window] What?! [looks out a half-moon window and sees a cat, it meows] It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet. [Mr. Kitty meows] No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself. [Mr. Kitty meows] I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty. [crosses his arms] I'm in trouble enough as it is. [Mr. Kitty paws at Cartman] All right, all right, fine. [heads to the attic door and goes downstairs, closing the door behind him]"
562,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[whispers and motions] All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly. [two kittens walk up next to Rufus] Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all. [they all look at him sadly, one of them meows] I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to- [the cats lower their head further while focusing on Cartman, Cartman starts to have tears in his eyes] Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. [turns and leaves]"
563,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,Huh? [removes the clothes hiding the cat] Oh my God... [moments later she's downstairs standing next to Gerald.]
564,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?"
565,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up to them] Yeah?
566,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, have you been getting high?!"
567,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[shrugs] No.
568,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Then why did your mother find this [holds up a bag of contraband - the cat] in your dresser drawer?!
569,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[holds his hands out in denial] All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend."
570,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,"[pointing] Don't lie to us, Kyle!"
571,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,How long have you been on the cheese?!
572,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
573,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
574,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?"
575,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, Kyle!"
576,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,God! [goes upstairs]
577,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!"
578,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
579,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,What are you gonna do?
580,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. [heads off]"
581,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"[showing a weakness of some sort] No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this. [continues down the steps] I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat. [getting dramatic] But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting. [approaches a contraption similar to the one Cartman made, but this one has a movie projector and screen. He takes the cat out of the bag and straps it into the contraption] I... I'll just do it one more time. [ties the cat's tail to the roof of the contraption's frame so there's no obstruction] One. Last. Time. [unfurls the screen] Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat. [moves a large empty box aside] And then I'll never do it again. [kneels down at the table and grabs the projector's trigger] After this one... last... time... [click. The projector begins to roll and a cat appears onscreen. The cat in the harness gets excited and begins to snarl. It finally squirts and Gerald stumbles backward a bit. He walks backward and freezes, his eyes unfocused]"
582,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
583,12,3,Eric Cartman,Who is it?!
584,12,3,Large-breasted Woman,"[with a foreign accent] Please! Open the door. [he opens the door, and a middle-aged woman stands before him] They say you are hiding cats."
585,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[quickly looks both ways] Hiding cats? [nervously] Why, that would be illegal. [backs into the living room]"
586,12,3,Large-breasted Woman,"[enters] You don't understand [kneels] My little Nishka, [produces the cat] She has nowhere else to go."
587,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another."
588,12,3,Large-breasted Woman,But they will find her.
589,12,3,Eric Cartman,"I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can- [his weakness comes through as the cat gazes at him] Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more..."
590,12,3,Large-breasted Woman,"[hands him Nishka, Cartman takes Nishka and pets her] Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. [begins to sob. Cartman joins her]"
591,12,3,Eric Cartman,"What the hell? [Kenny has somehow found the cats and is squeezing them to get cheesed. His face and parka are covered with concentrated piss. He grabs another cat and cheeses some more] Kenny, get out of here!"
592,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Woooooh! Woooooh!) [Kenny dances out of the attic]
593,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw, crap- Kenny! [Cartman begins to follow him down, but stops temporarily] Bad. Kitties."
594,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dad! Somebody's at the front door! [the doorbell rings twice and Kyle goes to his room door] Well am I grounded or not?! [the doorbell rings three times] Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! [leaves his room and opens the front door]
595,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up."
596,12,3,Eric Cartman,"He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude."
597,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[quizzically] What?
598,12,3,Stan Marsh,He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
599,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!"
600,12,3,Eric Cartman,"They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! [crosses his arms and looks away. Stan opens his mouth in shock, Kyle looks angrily at Cartman]"
601,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself."
602,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?"
603,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Hey everybody. Good to see you again. [Gerald and the woman head for the fountain. They both start undressing.]
604,12,3,Girl 2's Father,Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!
605,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Huh... how come?
606,12,3,Girl 2's Father,There is... another suitor. [Kenny walks into view]
607,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"What? [sees who it is] Get out of here, kid!"
608,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)"
609,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,You're too young for this stuff!
610,12,3,Girl 2's Father,"This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis! [the woman hides her privates, her father's arm blocks a full view of her breasts]"
611,12,3,Girl 2's Father,Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy! [the camera pans down and left to reveal a golden trophy made of two female statuettes kneeling back to back and holding their arms out. The woman places her breasts on their hands so it looks like the actual trophy is her breasts.]
612,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
613,12,3,Jimbo Kern,They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
614,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"She's mine, you little asshole!"
615,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Get the fuck off of me!)
616,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,[arriving] Gerald?!
617,12,3,Reporter,The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.
618,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
619,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,Don't touch me.
620,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"And to the people of South Park. [a shot of the town square and its citizens] I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine. [Kenny looks down in shame] We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain."
621,12,3,Stan Marsh,[puzzled] What the hell is he talking about?
622,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[eyes closed] I have no idea.
623,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real."
624,12,3,Randy Marsh,And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. [Sharon glares at him.]
625,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. [Kenny looks down again]"
626,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. I guess so.)
627,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-"
628,12,3,Stephen Stotch,"[cupping Butters' ears so Butters can't hear anything] Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald."
629,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats! [grins wide, then begins to cheer] Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! [crowd remains silent]"
630,12,3,Girl 2 s Father,"Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya? [Scrambles hisses, then scratches the father all over his head. His frightened wife and daughter leave him alone] Ahh! Get him off! [the boys, standing across the street, turn around]"
631,12,3,Stan Marsh,I'm sure glad that's over with. [the boys turn left and walk away]
632,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
633,12,3,Eric Cartman,"But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. [Kyle stops]"
634,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[cross] And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
635,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[strokes his chin] Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle."
636,12,3,Stan Marsh,You guys! Check it out. [smiles] It's Kenny. [Kenny has crossed the street to reach a flower patch. He picks one out and inhales deeply] Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
637,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [Kenny begins to grab more flowers with gusto to get more of their aroma. The other boys get worried] He's getting... really high on life. [Kenny begins to snort and grabs all the flowers he can, treating them just as he did the cats earlier.]"
638,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life."
639,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[runs to Kenny] Kenny! [Stan and Cartman follow. Kenny falls in Kyle's arms, goes into spasms, and then freezes, his eyes unfocused]"
640,12,3,Stan Marsh,What the hell kind of flowers are those?
641,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny? Kenny?!
642,12,4,Mr Mackey,"Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day."
643,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, I'm bored already."
644,12,4,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? [exits right as the tape starts up. A Canadian flag appears onscreen]"
645,12,4,WCB President,"[appears in his office onscreen] Hello, I am Stephen Abootman, President of the World Canadian Bureau. Do you ever stop to think how important Canada is to the world? Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up. [no one moves a muscle until one lone Canadian boy, Ike, stands up.] Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?"
646,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Gayness! [everyone laughs and looks at Ike, who looks chagrined.]"
647,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important?
648,12,4,Craig Tucker,Nothing! [everyone laughs harder and looks at Ike.]
649,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"My fellow Canadians, for too long we have been pushed around, and ridiculed! Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding! Instead, Canada Appreciation Day was mocked worldwide! [the crowd begins to clamor]"
650,12,4,Man 1,[wearing #10] Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!
651,12,4,Lumberjack 2,"It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?"
652,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!
653,12,4,Canadian Woman 1,Did you say strike?
654,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!
655,12,4,Man 2,"Canada, on strike."
656,12,4,Man 3,"Canada, on strike."
657,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"[a different crowd shot for each ""Canadaaa""]
Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Caaanaaadaaa!
Canada on strike! Canada says ""No more!""
No more neglect! We want respect! That's what we're striking for!
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats"
658,12,4,Border Guard,Can all just take a hike! [rolls down his window shade]
659,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"[large crowd] It's Canaada! On Strike!
[they whip out their strike signs]
Canada on strike! From Vancouver to St. John's [both locations are shown],
We raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon!
[a hockey team] And with our fingers up your ass,
[workers at The Canadian Maple Syrup Company] you won't be very psyched
[workers in the building drop syrup barrels from the upper floors] It's Canada! On Strike!
[Mounties march in a circle] And we will not bow a bunch! Our resolve is strong!
[A conductor leads a group of singers] We even took three hours to rehearse this striking song! [a trumpeter leans in and toots.]
[Pizza Nut] Canada on strike! No matter where you are,
[On TV at Café 180] If you are Canadian then you've got to do your part!
March out of the halls!"
660,12,4,Caf 18 Patron,"[stands up and poses] That's right, suck my Canadian balls!
[runs out and poses] It's Canada! On Strike!"
661,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"[the camera zooms out to a view from space of a nation of singing Canadians]
It's Canada! Canada! Canada! On Strike!
[a lone Canadian laughs somewhere]"
662,12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Ahhh, when you say ""Canada is on strike"", what exactly do you mean?"
663,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"What do you think it means?! [pounds the table] We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want"
664,12,4,French Delegate,Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?
665,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!
666,12,4,French Delegate,The WGA?
667,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[crosses his arms] Yes! The World Canadian Bureau! [the other delegates don't react.]
668,12,4,French Delegate,What exactly does Canada want?
669,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,We want: more... money!
670,12,4,Aide 1,[with mustache] Yeah! More money!
671,12,4,Japanese Delegate,More money from where?
672,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!"
673,12,4,Aide 1,Yeah! Give us Internet money!
674,12,4,British Delegate,"A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that-"
675,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Don't give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling! Are you gonna give Canada more money or not?! [pounds his fist on the table a few times]
676,12,4,British Delegate,I'm afraid we can't.
677,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Then you leave Canada no choice. [heads for the doors. His aides open them and he heads out] This strike shall continue! [the aides head out, closing the doors behind them.]"
678,12,4,Husband and Wife,"""Honk if you support Canada"" He- hey honey, watch this. [honks twice]"
679,12,4,Husband and Wife,"[looks at him] Oh, we're supporting unions."
680,12,4,Husband and Wife,That's right; we're a very progressive couple.
681,12,4,Husband and Wife,"Yes. [reaches over and honks the horn] Oh, that's fun!"
682,12,4,Husband and Wife,Well we've done our good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry.
683,12,4,Husband and Wife,Oh really? Goodie! [they drive off. Ike watches them leave]
684,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, I'm really worried about my brother."
685,12,4,Eric Cartman,We don't care. *urp*
686,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!"
687,12,4,Stan Marsh,"Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!"
688,12,4,Butters Stotch,Yippie!
689,12,4,Announcer,It's the Terrance and Phillip Show. [Terrance and Phillip in] Today's episode: I Fart Huckabees. [Terrance and Phillip are shown dressed in Viking warrior outfits]
690,12,4,Butters Stotch,"Aww, this one again?!"
691,12,4,Stan Marsh,"God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!"
692,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car."
693,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,Oh? Does it run on electricity?
694,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"[the boys say the line too] No, it uses natural gas. [they do raspberries as Terrance farts on Phillip. Terrance and Phillip laugh]"
695,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,Not as fat as your face!
696,12,4,Butters Stotch,"Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings."
697,12,4,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!"
698,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
699,12,4,Stan Marsh,"It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. [""Terrance and Phillip"" disappears and ""Family Guy"" comes on]"
700,12,4,Peter Griffin,"You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang ""La Cucaracha"" for Paul McCartney?"
701,12,4,Eric Cartman,[jumps off the couch and runs to the TV] No! NOOO!
702,12,4,Peter Griffin,La Cucaracha- [Cartman turns off the TV and faces his friends] We are NOT... resorting to that!
703,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,We want more! We want more!
704,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! [Terrance and Phillip walk up to him]"
705,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit."
706,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Go home?! You can't leave the picket line!
707,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic."
708,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!"
709,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Don't call me a rat, buddih!"
710,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"I'm not your buddih, friend!"
711,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"He's not your friend, guy!"
712,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"I'm not your guy, buddih!"
713,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"He's not your buddih, friend!"
714,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"I'm not your friend, guy! [all three fall silent, and Stephen goes forward] Don't you two understand anything?! You think striking is a joke?! You think it's something to ridicule?!"
715,12,4,Weird Hat Guy,"[pops in] Yah, you think this is funnih?"
716,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[moves to address the whole crowd] Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we have nothing?!
717,12,4,Aide 1,[runs up with a cell phone] Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike!
718,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later! [the crowd gets excited and starts chatting] Shh, shh, quiet everyone! Let me handle this. [everyone falls silent as he takes the call] Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA."
719,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. [he's calling from his house, with the other boys standing back aways]"
720,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Oh you do, huh?! [muffles the phone, then tells the others] They've had enough. They want us to end the strike. [everyone cheers] Quiet, quiet, shh, shh, sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this. [the Canadians fall silent and Stephen returns to the phone] All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh!"
721,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,We totally think you should have more money.
722,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Wwe got 'em! We did it! [jumps up and down with much energy. Everyone cheers. ""Great job!""] All right, how much are you gonna give us?"
723,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
724,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!"
725,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,The Internet?
726,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"You listen to me, friend! [walks away from the crowd so they don't hear him so loudly] You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead! [hangs up, then faces the crowd] Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls."
727,12,4,Stan Marsh,What'd they say?
728,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
729,12,4,Eric Cartman,How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
730,12,4,Butters Stotch,"Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?"
731,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
732,12,4,Eric Cartman,[steps up] Wait. I've got it.
733,12,4,Butters Stotch,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt [the teddy bear outfit returns]
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? [Stan gives a thumbs-up. Cartman does the same. The video is on YouToob]
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

[from behind a big chocolate heart] It's okay
[Butters floating in space] Ih-if you have a little fight
[a girl watches the video] Don't you worry
[Butters bites into the heart] I won't bite (Not that hard)
[Spaceman Butters] If you want it
[a man watches the video] I'll give you power
Just be gentle
[Flower Butters] I'm delicate like a flower

Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please"
734,12,4,A Nun,Oh my.
735,12,4,Butters Stotch,"[now in three voices] I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
[wearing black jeans with ""what what"" on the butt] I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
[a naked Butters holds a rose] You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!"
736,12,4,Eric Cartman,There's more people viewing it!
737,12,4,Stan Marsh,This is going great!
738,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks over to the window] Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! [Ike is on his back]"
739,12,4,Tom the Anchorman,"And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending."
740,12,4,Aide 1,How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!
741,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories."
742,12,4,Tom the Anchorman,"In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called ""What What (In My Asshole)""."
743,12,4,Female Reporter,"[in front of Butters' house] Tom, in just one week the video has become the most watched thing in all of America. [Butters appears at his bedroom window and waves at the camera] The boy in the video, referred to by most as ""that little gay kid"", [Butters stops and leaves the window] has already been asked to appear on Jimmy Kimmel and The Today Show."
744,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?!
745,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?"
746,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!
747,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation."
748,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Yeah, let's give it up, guy."
749,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!"
750,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Well I'm not your friend, buddih!"
751,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Well I'm not your buddih, guy!"
752,12,4,Canadian Woman 2,Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!
753,12,4,Tom the Anchorman,"And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money. [the Canadians cheer]"
754,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen."
755,12,4,Tom the Anchorman,"In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians."
756,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,What?
757,12,4,Female Reporter,Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?
758,12,4,Danish Man,"Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us."
759,12,4,Danish Woman,Nobody knows where Denmark is.
760,12,4,Danish Man,"Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe."
761,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,SCABS! How could you?! [runs up to the TV annd destroys it with one kick]
762,12,4,Stan Marsh,"Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money."
763,12,4,Clerk,Take a number and wait with everyone else.
764,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob."
765,12,4,Clerk,[not taking time out from her work] Take a number and wait with everyone else! [Stan takes a numbered slip from the dispenser and leads the other boys to some seats in a waiting room nearby]
766,12,4,Black Man,"[slowly, a little creepily] Chocolate Raaain."
767,12,4,Butters Stotch,Aaah. [another man walks up to the boys]
768,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"Hey, I know you. You're the ""What What (In My Asshole)"" kid."
769,12,4,Butters Stotch,"[insulted, crosses his arms] ""What What (In The Butt),"" sir."
770,12,4,Stan Marsh,It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
771,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa. [to his right is the Numa Numa guy. He begins dancing to a song]"
772,12,4,Numa Numa,"Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha"
773,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"And the Star Wars kid. [the kid starts to dance around as in his video] And the Internet sensation Cute Sneezing Panda. [as in its video, the mother panda sneezes as soon as her child moves] And there's Dramatic Look Gopher. [the camera pans by a lonely girl and focuses on the gopher, who seems to notice the camera is on him. He quickly turns to face the camera and freezes]"
774,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!"
775,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"[to Butters] So, how many people have seen your Internet video?"
776,12,4,Butters Stotch,Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
777,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire."
778,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year."
779,12,4,Chris Crocker,[jumps in out of nowhere] Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone! Leave him alohohone! I'm serious! [a phone rings and Kyle digs into his pocket]
780,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,[finds the phone...] Excuse me. [...leaves his seat and exits the waiting room. Then he takes the call] Hello?
781,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[sitting on a cardboard box] You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.
782,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Wait we're working on it.
783,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[stands and moves forward] You're stalling! Because you think I'll give up. You know that most Canadians are talkin' about giving up the strike already. [coughs away from the phone] You've got me over a barrel and you know it!
784,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Sir, we're doing everything we can."
785,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood! [Kyle stays quiet] Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will never call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die."
786,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,We don't want you to die.
787,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. [slowly hangs up]
788,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We have to speed this up! [to Chocolate Rain Guy] Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?"
789,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.
790,12,4,Star Wars Kid,"Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!"
791,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.
792,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"Oh please, Laughing Baby had four times as many views as you! [the baby begins to laugh and laugh...]"
793,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby!"
794,12,4,Afro Ninja,Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.
795,12,4,Star Wars Kid,Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions!
796,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,You all wanna motherfuckin' die?! [whips out a Glock and cocks it]
797,12,4,Chris Crocker,NOOO! [grabs the gun and tries to wrestle it from Chocolate Rain Guy]
798,12,4,Numa Numa Guy,Haw!
799,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn."
800,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,Hai Hayaaa!
801,12,4,Numa Numa,"Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyah- [kicks Tron Guy in the balls, then lands a left hook on his face]"
802,12,4,Chris Crocker,[jumps in to separate the two men] Leave Tron Guy alone! Leave him alone! [the baby continues laughing. Chocolate Rain Guy grabs Chris Crocker by the hair and drags him around. Chris is screaming]
803,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Get ready for some chocolate pain, bitch! [aims his right at Chris' head. Chris quickly bites Chocolate Rain Guy's right leg, making him drop the gun. The mother panda mauls Numa Numa, Tron Guy throws his frisbee again, and Chris Crocker jumps in again]"
804,12,4,Chris Crocker,"Leave the panda alone! Leave her alone, I'm serious! [the mother panda stands on her hind legs and just swats Chris out of view, killing him. Chocolate Rain Guy reaches for his fallen gun, turns around, and kills Star Wars Kid with two shots. The mother panda mauls Tron Guy to death, and Chocolate Rain Guy kills the panda with four shots. He then aims at the gopher]"
805,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?! [the gopher, who's facing away from him, suddenly turns its head to him, looking at him intently] Ughhh, my brains. [his head swells up and explodes. His body staggers for a few seconds, then falls to the side. One last bullet leaves his gun and blows the gopher's head off. Anyone who was involved in the battle is gone]"
806,12,4,Eric Cartman,Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
807,12,4,Aide 1,"[opens the office door] Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate!"
808,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[turns around] What?! You mean it?! [Kyle and friends walk in]
809,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, we did it."
810,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Who the hell are you?
811,12,4,Stan Marsh,We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
812,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Here. [hands Mr. Abootman the money] We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. [Mr. Abootman takes the check and looks at it]
813,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?! [turns away] You little timewasters!
814,12,4,Stan Marsh,"Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!"
815,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
816,12,4,Eric Cartman,"...You are a homo, Butters."
817,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!"
818,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it! [the phone rings and he turns to answer it] Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau."
819,12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike."
820,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!
821,12,4,French Delegate,"No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park. [Mr. Abootman drops the phone and begins to weep. He walks away with his hands over his eyes]"
822,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[picks up the phone] Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!"
823,12,4,Swiss Delegate,Excuse me?
824,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Mr. Abootman leans on the door, crying] He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!"
825,12,4,French Delegate,"Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize"
826,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"If they give you something small, will you end the strike?"
827,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?
828,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
829,12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Sure, why not?"
830,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,We have won! [no one reacts: they're all too tired to]
831,12,4,Lumberjack 2,Well how much did we get?
832,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these... [holds up some coupons] coupons to Bennigan's! And... [holds up a bag of sweets] free bubblegum... for every Canadian. [his aide steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands] These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course."
833,12,4,Aide 1,We did it! [aide 2 steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands]
834,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. [headlines follow: The Canuck Reporter has ""Canada Wins The Strike"". Canadiety has ""Strike over! Canada Victorious!"". Canada Today has ""Strike Victory Party Set For Next Week"".]"
835,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Ike. Ike! [Ike wakes up] It's over.
836,12,4,Ike Broflovski,[stands up] It's over?
837,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Here you go. [hands him a Bennigan's coupon and a gumdrop. Kyle and the others head indoors]
838,12,4,Stan Marsh,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with."
839,12,4,Butters Stotch,Me too!
840,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media."
841,12,4,Stan Marsh,...Yeah.
842,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo! [the reason for everyone standing around is shown: a memorial wall on one side of the room has pictures of everyone who died during the strike. Mourners walk up with bouquets and drop them off at the table in front of the wall.]"
843,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Hold on a minute! Wait just a second! [the music stops as Terrance holds out a calculator] We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!"
844,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
845,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance."
846,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
847,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect. [Terrance and Phillip don't believe what they're hearing]"
848,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!
849,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"We're setting you adrift, idiot!"
850,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
851,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"You'll regret this day, friend!"
852,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"I'm not your friend, buddih!"
853,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"I'm not your buddih, guy!"
854,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"He's not your guy, friend!"
855,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"[loud and drawn out] I'm not your friend, buddih!"
856,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"We're not your buddih, guy!"
857,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"[now far away] I'm not your guy, friend!"
858,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know? [wipes away tears, then throws the tissue away] I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man"
859,12,5,Butters Stotch,Are we gonna get tested on this?
860,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"This sex change was a big mistake, okay? [blows her nose] I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted."
861,12,5,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Dude, wanna do some math problems?"
862,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"[tosses another tissue away, grabs another one] And then, I go to the doctor, right? And I say ""Doctor, I wanna go back to being a man,"" and he says ""There's been too much damage. You can't go back. Where are you going to find a penis?"" [gets up, and his chair topples over] Whattaya mean, where am I gonna find a penis?! [throws a bust] I'm a man! I deserve a God damned penis! [throws some tissues, some books, and an apple towards the class. Stan shuts his eyes shut so nothing gets in them. Mrs. Garrison grabs her chair and crashes it through a window. Then he knocks the metal drawers over, then kicks the desk, grunting all the while]"
863,12,5,Principal Victoria,"[not seen] Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison! [he stops and looks up. He sees Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria, her arms crossed, at the door] Could we speak with you please?"
864,12,5,Mrs Garrison,[walks out of the classroom still sniffling] What do you want? I'm trying to teach.
865,12,5,Mr Mackey,"Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay? [Principal Victoria walks into the classroom and closes the door]"
866,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You have a penis! [walks away in a huff]"
867,12,5,Principal Victoria,"Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz."
868,12,5,Eric Cartman,"[raises his hand] Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here."
869,12,5,Principal Victoria,"Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? [no one else volunteers. Cartman stands on his chair and raises his left arm high]"
870,12,5,Eric Cartman,Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
871,12,5,Principal Victoria,"Any other volunteers, perhaps?"
872,12,5,Eric Cartman,[now on his desk and stretching that left arm up higher] Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
873,12,5,Principal Victoria,"All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class."
874,12,5,Eric Cartman,Yes! [walks up next to Garrison's desk]
875,12,5,Principal Victoria,"Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly. [leaves the classroom and closes the door. Cartman turns to the board and walks up to it. He grabs the wooden pointer and smacks it softly against his left palm] Well well well. Who's teacher now? [whips it against the floor] Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!"
876,12,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You're not the teacher, fatass."
877,12,5,Eric Cartman,"That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended! [whips the pointer against the floor] Yeahhh. [whips the pointer against the floor again] Mmm yeah, you like that? [Kyle just rolls his eyes] All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here! [whips the pointer against the floor again] Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. [waves the pointer around a little and follows it with his eyes.]"
878,12,5,News Anchor,"And so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure. In other news tonight, a South Park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice. This picture of a mouse [a picture of a mouse with a human ear growing on its back] genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest."
879,12,5,Mrs Garrison,[now attentive] What?
880,12,5,News Anchor,But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.
881,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Holy Freaking Jesus.
882,12,5,Researcher 1,"Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop. Here's the mouse you saw on television. [Mrs. Garrison looks at the mouse] Once the ear fully forms, it can be transplanted onto a person."
883,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"Doctor, what about a penis?"
884,12,5,Researcher 1,"Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina."
885,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?"
886,12,5,Researcher 1,You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work.
887,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I need a penis."
888,12,5,Researcher 1,"All right. [Mrs. Garrison grins] All right, let's see what we can do."
889,12,5,Principal Victoria,"Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher."
890,12,5,Eric Cartman,Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
891,12,5,Mr Mackey,"Uh, ""commend"" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?"
892,12,5,Principal Victoria,"[looks through some papers] After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them."
893,12,5,Eric Cartman,"[at ease] Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning."
894,12,5,Principal Victoria,These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
895,12,5,Board Rep 1,"[a black man] Young man, word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking. We would like you to try your methods on one of our inner-city school classes."
896,12,5,Board Rep 2,"[a white man] These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?"
897,12,5,Eric Cartman,That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
898,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks."
899,12,5,Kyle Broflovski,You're not an awesome teacher!
900,12,5,Eric Cartman,Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
901,12,5,Kyle Broflovski,The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
902,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?"
903,12,5,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny's!
904,12,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, that was my idea.)"
905,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around."
906,12,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! [walks away. Stan and Kenny follow. Cartman is scared, then he starts thinking]"
907,12,5,Eric Cartman,Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
908,12,5,Principal Victoria,"[enters] Students, quiet! Quiet please! [a wad of paper goes her way and hits] Give me your attention!"
909,12,5,Teen Boy 1,"I'll give you my attention. All night long, Mrs. Miller. [the class laughs]"
910,12,5,Mrs Miller,"[the principal] You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher."
911,12,5,Class,Ohhhhhhhhhhh.
912,12,5,Mrs Miller,This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez
913,12,5,Eric Cartman,[dressed as Jaime Escalante] Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez. [holds up his left thumb] Your new teacher.
914,12,5,Teen Boy 2,What the hell is thiiis?
915,12,5,Eric Cartman,I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
916,12,5,Researcher 1,"Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison."
917,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Mr. Garrison! [they approach an incubator]
918,12,5,Researcher 1,"Sorry, Mister Garrison. Your DNA has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse. And so... here's your penis. [Mr. Garrison gazes into the incubator. A mouse is wrapped in gauze all over, and a penis is riding on its back]"
919,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Wow! My penis looks great!
920,12,5,Researcher 1,Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations.
921,12,5,Mrs Garrison,How long before it's ready?
922,12,5,Researcher 1,"Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon."
923,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Let me see if it feels right in my hand. [opens the incubator door and reaches in...]
924,12,5,Researcher 1,No! Don't open the- [the mouse escapes]
925,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Whoa no!
926,12,5,Researcher 2,Don't let it get out of the lab! [the mouse reaches the entrance and escapes when an unsuspecting researcher opens the door from outside]
927,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"Mah penis! [gives chase, and some researchers join him] Stop, penis! Come back here!"
928,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu."
929,12,5,Teen Boy 3,"Hey man, what the hell do you think you're doing?!"
930,12,5,Teen Boy 4,Yeahhhh.
931,12,5,Eric Cartman,Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
932,12,5,Teen Boy 5,"Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you! [the rest of the class voice their protests as well. Cartman turns his back to them and looks down]"
933,12,5,Eric Cartman,"How do I reach these keeds? [faces the class, his left hand tucked under the left pant pocket] The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time. [holds up a picture] This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top."
934,12,5,Teen Girl 1,"Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!"
935,12,5,Eric Cartman,"No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy."
936,12,5,Teen Boy 6,This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.
937,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Go ahead, the door's right there. [turns left] Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu. [the boy walks to the door and leaves. Cartman turns away from the class and sighs, dropping the photo] How do I reach these keeds?"
938,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis? [the boys can't figure out what he's talking about.]"
939,12,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
940,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese. [runs off]"
941,12,5,Butters Stotch,[rubbing his temples] Ow. That hurt my brains. [the pain gets worse] Oww.
942,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Nice form, compadre. [walks towards the basket with the ball]"
943,12,5,Teen Boy 6,"Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating."
944,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game? [whistles] Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? [a scoreboard is shown, and a boy on the platform looks over at him]"
945,12,5,Teen Boy 7,"Sure thing, Mr. C."
946,12,5,Eric Cartman,"[gets into position] Okay, you start on defense, amigo. [dribbles the ball for a few seconds, then whacks the boy on the right shin with a collapsible pointer]"
947,12,5,Teen Boy 6,[falls down and grabs his right leg] AAAAH! [Cartman continues towards the basket and scores. The score is now 1-0 Visitors]
948,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!"
949,12,5,Teen Boy 6,You cheated!
950,12,5,Eric Cartman,"What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn. [the boy is on offense. He dribbles for a few seconds and moves to the basket, but Cartman again takes out his pointer and whacks the boy's left shin. The boy falls again, and Cartman steals the ball and scores again. The boy at the scoreboard updates the score: 2-0 Visitors] That's two to nothing, amigoo. [his opponent stands up]"
951,12,5,Teen Boy 6,"Fuck you, man, you can't do that!"
952,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. [throws the ball back at the boy]"
953,12,5,Teen Boy 6,"I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it. [throws the ball away and limps off]"
954,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing! [sighs] How do I reach these keeds?"
955,12,5,Linda Stotch,"What is that? [turns around and looks. The modified mouse runs across the kitchen floor; she screams and hops onto a footstool, then lifts up her skirt] Eeeek! Eeeek! [the mouse runs across the floor again, in the opposite direction] Eeeek! Eeeek! [hops off and runs to the living room entrance] Stephen! Stephen come quick!"
956,12,5,Stephen Stotch,"[reading the paper with a pipe in his hand] What is it, dear?"
957,12,5,Linda Stotch,A penis is loose in our kitchen!
958,12,5,Stephen Stotch,A penis?
959,12,5,Linda Stotch,Yes! It just ran across the floor!
960,12,5,Stephen Stotch,"Now darling, calm down."
961,12,5,Linda Stotch,Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
962,12,5,Stephen Stotch,"Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises. [Butters smiles. Stephen gets up from his armchair and walks to the kitchen. Butters joins him. The mouse runs across the floor again]"
963,12,5,Linda Stotch,"There! There, you see it?"
964,12,5,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, it's just a little penis, darling."
965,12,5,Linda Stotch,I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. [the mouse runs across the floor again]
966,12,5,Butters Stotch,Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!
967,12,5,Stephen Stotch,Your teacher's penis?
968,12,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, that must be his."
969,12,5,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?"
970,12,5,Butters Stotch,[didn't quite get it until...] Huh?
971,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time. [hops onto a box so he could write on the chalkboard. He draws a video camera aimed at a box marked D] When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- [the errant student returns]"
972,12,5,Teen Boy 6,I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.
973,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack. [the student takes his seat] All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me."
974,12,5,Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules."""
975,12,5,Eric Cartman,Good. Again.
976,12,5,Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules."""
977,12,5,Eric Cartman,Again!
978,12,5,Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules."""
979,12,5,Eric Cartman,Now you sound like white people!
980,12,5,Class,"[now with pounding fists] ""I mis-interpreted the rules!"""
981,12,5,Mrs Garrison,What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!
982,12,5,Stephen Stotch,"Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out."
983,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere!
984,12,5,A Woman,EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! [the three guys look up]
985,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Holy Crap! [takes off after the sound.]
986,12,5,Woman,Eeeek! Eeeeeek!
987,12,5,Husband,"Carole, get down from there!"
988,12,5,Woman,Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!
989,12,5,Husband,I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it.
990,12,5,Mrs Garrison,[pops into view] You saw a penis?!
991,12,5,Woman 2,[inside the Inn] Eeeeeeeek! [Mrs. Garrison rushes in]
992,12,5,Woman 2,"Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek. [the mouse runs across the floor and Mrs. Garrison gives chase. The penis-mouse runs down the hall and into a steam room]"
993,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"[runs down the hall] Come back here, penis! [enters the steam room and looks around] There you are! Got you! [backs out of the steam room holding a penis... which is attached to a man. Garrison looks at the penis more closely, then at the man's face] Hey, you're not my penis. [the man punches her across the face] Ogh! [the penis-mouse runs out. Garrison lets go and gives chase again] There it goes! Stop you!"
994,12,5,Eric Cartman,The answer to #27 is 5.
995,12,5,Class,[repeating] The answer to #27 is 5.
996,12,5,Eric Cartman,The answer to #28 is 14.
997,12,5,Class,"""The answer to #28 is 14."""
998,12,5,Teen Girl 2,"Man, what's the point? [grabs her books and heads for the door] What's the point of any of this? [cries and exits]"
999,12,5,Eric Cartman,"All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back. [leaves the classroom and looks around for the girl] Melita! Melita, hold on. [walks up to her] You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?"
1000,12,5,Melita,"There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it."
1001,12,5,Eric Cartman,"[sighs] How do I reach these keeds? [turns around and faces her] All right, let's go get you an abortion."
1002,12,5,Melita,No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.
1003,12,5,Eric Cartman,Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
1004,12,5,Melita,That cheating is good?
1005,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself. [Melita turns right and walks off a bit] Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life."
1006,12,5,Melita,"I don't know, Mr. C."
1007,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns. [walks around to face her] It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest."
1008,12,5,Sgt Yates,[taking notes] And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago? [a police sketch artist works on a portrait]
1009,12,5,Mrs Garrison,That's right.
1010,12,5,Officer Harris,Long whiskers or short?
1011,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"Short, and little fluffy ears."
1012,12,5,Officer Harris,"Fluffy ears, okay."
1013,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"Think you got it, Mitch?"
1014,12,5,Mitch Harris,"I think so, sir. Is this pretty close? [shows his sketch to Garrison: it's Mickey Mouse with a giant boner under his shorts]"
1015,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"[disappointed] No, no, not like that! That's just silly. [an officer walks into view]"
1016,12,5,Officer,"Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner."
1017,12,5,Sgt Yates,What is it?
1018,12,5,Officer,Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.
1019,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Wall come on! [runs out. The two other officers follow him]
1020,12,5,Woman 2,[quickly jumps onto her chair and lifts up her skirt] EEK!
1021,12,5,Man 2,[looks around] What's the matter?
1022,12,5,Woman 2,A penis!
1023,12,5,Woman 3,[quickly jumps onto her table and lifts up her skirt] A penis? Where?
1024,12,5,Woman 4,"There it is! [quickly jumps onto the table at her booth and lifts up her skirt] Eek! [the other women at the restaurant do the same thing, and soon all you hear are ""Eek, a penis!""]"
1025,12,5,Mrs Garrison,[enters the restaurant followed by the three officers] Where is it?!
1026,12,5,Mitch Harris,"Look, there! [points to the mouse as it heads to the kitchen. A waiter doesn't notice the mouse passing by him]"
1027,12,5,Mrs Garrison,Come on! [he and the officers run to the kitchen]
1028,12,5,Italian Chef,What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen? [wields a rolling pin]
1029,12,5,Mrs Garrison,[entering with the cops] Huy! Don't you dare kill my penis! [the mouse leaves through an open window] Crap! We've gotta go back around!
1030,12,5,The Penis Mouse,Someone somewhere is loving me tonightLooking at the same moon and seeing it so bright.
1031,12,5,The Penis Mouse,Someone somewhere is feelin' my despair
1032,12,5,The Penis Mouse,Feelin' my despair
1033,12,5,The Penis Mouse,And this same moon is
1034,12,5,The Penis Mouse,[together] making them think of that-.
1035,12,5,The Penis Mouse,[together] making them think of that-.
1036,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"There it is! [the mouse runs away. Garrison gives chase again, with the cops and the chef joining him. The mouse runs to the sewer and drops in] No! Nooo! [dives after it, but can't reach far enough in to get it] No! No!"
1037,12,5,Mitch Harris,There's not a chance now.
1038,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"No we, we can find it! [looks intensely down through the grate]"
1039,12,5,Sgt Yates,"Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men. [they leave. Garrison stands up, beat]"
1040,12,5,Mrs Miller,"Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit. [a quick cheer goes up] The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating."
1041,12,5,Eric Cartman,Uh what?
1042,12,5,Mrs Miller,The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud. [turns right and leaves the classroom]
1043,12,5,Teen Boy 8,Monitor us in a private room?
1044,12,5,Teen Boy 3,Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along.
1045,12,5,Teen Boy 2,I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!
1046,12,5,Eric Cartman,"Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them."
1047,12,5,Teen Boy 8,"[stands up] Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all!"
1048,12,5,Eric Cartman,"How do I reeeach these keeeeds?! [the boy, cowed, slips back into his seat. Cartman faces the board] Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened? [dryly] They lost. [faces the class] Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives."
1049,12,5,Teen Girl 1,"Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys."
1050,12,5,Eric Cartman,You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
1051,12,5,Mrs Garrison,"You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis. [a squeaky thing is heard. Garrison notices and stops crying] Well what the? [raises her head and looks down, then looks towards her feet. The mouse that has been fleeing all night is now struggling to get on the bench] Why... it's my penis. [the mouse is now wholly on the bench] My penis came back. But why? [the mouse moves closer. Mrs. Garrison lowers her left hand to the bench. The mouse walks onto her hand, and she lifts it up] I guess it's true. What's that old saying? ""If you love your penis, let it go..."""
1052,12,5,Mrs Miller,The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100% [their parents applaud. Melita and a short boy look at each other]
1053,12,5,Teen Boy 6,"Uh, can we say something?"
1054,12,5,Mrs Miller,"Sure. [leaves the podium. The short boy reaches for a plaque and hands it to the taller boy, who now takes the mic]"
1055,12,5,Teen Boy 6,"We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez! [Cartman, standing far from the podium and off to one side, walks up to the podium and reaches the mic. The students gather 'round him and clap as adults take pictures.]"
1056,12,5,Eric Cartman,[basking in the success] I reeached these keeeds.
1057,12,5,Principal Victoria,"Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. [everyone claps as Mr. Garrison makes his return]"
1058,12,5,Mr Garrison,"Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend. [the mouse that grew his penis climbs onto his right shoulder, the penis having been removed from it and attached to Mr. Garrison. Garrison turns around] But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man."
1059,12,5,A Teacher,"Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies."
1060,12,5,Mr Garrison,"Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot! [Thompson is dumbfounded. Garrison turns around and jumps up to click his heels] Yeah! I'm back!"
1061,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed."
1062,12,6,Stan Marsh,"Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things"
1063,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!"
1064,12,6,Stan Marsh,"[sighs] Aw man! [shuts off his monitor as Sharon leaves, then goes to bed. Sharon heads for Shelly's room]"
1065,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime."
1066,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!"
1067,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Shelly! [leaves and closes the door]"
1068,12,6,Shelly Marsh,Why do you hate me?!
1069,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"[entering Randy's study] Randy, off the Internet."
1070,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone."
1071,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"No, mister, it's time for night-night."
1072,12,6,Randy Marsh,"But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-"
1073,12,6,Sharon Marsh,You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. [leaves and closes the door]
1074,12,6,Randy Marsh,[left to his thoughts] One more thing? [thinks a bit and then starts typing quickly] Ooooyeah... [starts masturbatng under the desk]
1075,12,6,Stan Marsh,What the hell?
1076,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[entering, still in his night robe] Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! [reaches Stan's desk with urgency and moves Stan away]"
1077,12,6,Stan Marsh,What?
1078,12,6,Randy Marsh,"My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?"
1079,12,6,Stan Marsh,My Internet's not working either.
1080,12,6,Randy Marsh,What?! [sees but doesn't believe]
1081,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"[enters Stan's room with her laptop] Dad, the Internet's not working!"
1082,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[pulling on some cables] I know that, okay?!"
1083,12,6,Shelly Marsh,I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
1084,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"[enters] Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open."
1085,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[leaves the computer to be in the middle of his family] Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. [he's the only one looking panicked]"
1086,12,6,Randy Marsh,[in despair] Gerald. Please help us.
1087,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,Randy. What happened?
1088,12,6,Randy Marsh,Our house... It has no Internet.
1089,12,6,Sheila Broflovski,[arrives and stands next to him] Oh my God.
1090,12,6,Randy Marsh,[enters the living room] We've got nothing! It's just gone.
1091,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
1092,12,6,Randy Marsh,[gratefully] Thank you Gerald. [the other Marshes enter]
1093,12,6,Stan Marsh,[heads for a computer] I'm getting on it first.
1094,12,6,Randy Marsh,[giving chase] Oh no you're not!
1095,12,6,Stan Marsh,"[steps into Kyle's room] Kyle, I need to use your Internet"
1096,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,Ih it's not working.
1097,12,6,Randy Marsh,[steps into Kyle's room] What?!
1098,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
1099,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,"No. [rushes to the computer to see for himself] No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night."
1100,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[firmly] It's not working, Gerald."
1101,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
1102,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!"
1103,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,I have to get online before school.
1104,12,6,Stan Marsh,What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
1105,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Right, Starbucks!"
1106,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
1107,12,6,Stephen Stotch,"Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?"
1108,12,6,Randy Marsh,No! Nobody's is!
1109,12,6,Man 1,[comes out of his house with a laptop] Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!
1110,12,6,Randy Marsh,Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
1111,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. [everyone climbs in.]
1112,12,6,Randy Marsh,"God, the whole neighborhood's affected. [a man sticks a Yoshiba laptop in front of the windshield]"
1113,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Get out of the way, Peterson! [motions him away]"
1114,12,6,Motel Clerk,"Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya."
1115,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's not working here?
1116,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store."
1117,12,6,Man 2,"No, don't. You're wasting your time."
1118,12,6,Randy Marsh,How do you know?!
1119,12,6,Man 2,Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!
1120,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
1121,12,6,Stephen Stotch,Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
1122,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Good idea! [walks forward a bit and pulls out a Blackberry] No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!"
1123,12,6,Mr Garrison,[with pipe and laptop] There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
1124,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
1125,12,6,Man 3,What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
1126,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[thinks a moment] A television! [everyone else thinks, then moves down the street as if they were one]"
1127,12,6,Anchorman,"Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back."
1128,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, it's statewide."
1129,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,It could be nationwide.
1130,12,6,Anchorman,"Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either. [everyone leaves Tele's]"
1131,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,No Internet... anywhere...
1132,12,6,Randy Marsh,Jesus... we're all alone... [POV change to a shot of the town from a distance. Another POV change to a shot of the town from even further away]
1133,12,6,Sharon Marsh,What's the matter?
1134,12,6,Randy Marsh,"I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. [coughs]"
1135,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead. [looks at Stan] If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! [starts punching Stan around like a punching bag. Stan screams]"
1136,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[pulls Shelly away from Stan] Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!"
1137,12,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!"
1138,12,6,Randy Marsh,You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
1139,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Randy, where will you go?"
1140,12,6,Randy Marsh,We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
1141,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
1142,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!"
1143,12,6,Stephen Stotch,It could come back.
1144,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find. [motions to Sharon] Come on, let's go."
1145,12,6,Stephen Stotch,"Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?"
1146,12,6,Randy Marsh,How. You won't have Internet. [starts the car and moves out]
1147,12,6,Motel Clerk,"[fanning himself] Sorry folks, we're full up."
1148,12,6,Randy Marsh,Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
1149,12,6,Motel Clerk,You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee. [motions the direction of travel] It's about a mile down the road.
1150,12,6,Randy Marsh,"I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. [an elderly man weeps]"
1151,12,6,Transient Man 1,"Where are you from, old-timer?"
1152,12,6,Transient Men and Old Timer,"Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too."
1153,12,6,Transient Man 2,Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.
1154,12,6,Transient Man 3,"Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it."
1155,12,6,Transient Man 4,When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
1156,12,6,Transient Man 1,Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.
1157,12,6,Randy Marsh,Sure will be nice. [Stan looks really sad]
1158,12,6,Transient Man 5,You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?
1159,12,6,Randy Marsh,That's right. We need to get online.
1160,12,6,Transient Man 5,"Haha. ""Get online"" he says."
1161,12,6,Stan Marsh,[annoyed] What's so funny about that?
1162,12,6,Transient Man 5,"Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there? [the other men look at each other] Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead. [his eyes begin to well up] Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder... [weeps]"
1163,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. [the group breaks up for the night]"
1164,12,6,Shelly Marsh,Amiiir... I miss you so much...
1165,12,6,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to her] Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. [she just sits up and punches him away like a beach ball, then lies down without a break in crying]"
1166,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Everyone, wake up! [the others wake up] We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! [takes an off-ramp]"
1167,12,6,Worker,Name?
1168,12,6,Randy Marsh,Do they have Internet here?
1169,12,6,Worker,Name?
1170,12,6,Randy Marsh,Marsh.
1171,12,6,Worker,Service provider?
1172,12,6,Randy Marsh,NetZero.
1173,12,6,Worker,"All right, stay in line. [moves on to the next car] Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite."
1174,12,6,Randy Marsh,So is there Internet here?
1175,12,6,Worker 2,"[voice only, from the front] Stay in line and get to your campsite. [Randy drives forward and into the camp]"
1176,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet."
1177,12,6,Refugee Man 1,"Yeah, they've got it here. [Randy gives a thumbs up]"
1178,12,6,Stan Marsh,All right!
1179,12,6,Refugee Man 2,"But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a little Internet. [curls his thumb and index finger to create a small space between them] Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully."
1180,12,6,Refugee Man 3,Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.
1181,12,6,Randy Marsh,Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
1182,12,6,Volunteer 1,"Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do."
1183,12,6,Refugee Man 4,"Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon."
1184,12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, time's up."
1185,12,6,Refugee Man 4,No! No wait! I haven't entered the shipping information! [an MP hauls him away] NO! NOO!
1186,12,6,Volunteer 2,"Next? Brady, John H."
1187,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? [Sharon is within earshot]"
1188,12,6,Sharon Marsh,[walks up to him] What did you say?
1189,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody."
1190,12,6,Anchorman,"And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here. [the fax machine starts printing]"
1191,12,6,Anchorman 2,A fax! A fax is coming through! [points to it with both index fingers with lots of enthusiasm]
1192,12,6,Anchorman,"Oh yeah, a fax!!"
1193,12,6,Anchorman 2,Oh a fax!
1194,12,6,Anchorman,"It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!"
1195,12,6,Anchorman 2,"It's a fax, we got a fax! [the fax copy pops out and both men grab for it. ] Uh-"
1196,12,6,Anchorman,"Oh! it says, ""The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it."""
1197,12,6,Anchorman 2,[a few seconds later] We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
1198,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,Where... is... the Internet?
1199,12,6,General,"Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working."
1200,12,6,Scientist 1,"We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly."
1201,12,6,General,Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
1202,12,6,Scientist 2,"Here it is, general. The Internet. [before them is a colossal router]"
1203,12,6,General,What's wrong with it?
1204,12,6,Scientist 2,See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green.
1205,12,6,General,"[walks towards it a bit, in awe] My God."
1206,12,6,Transient Man 6,"Hahaha, thedancingkitty.com, heh, wum, I wonder what that is, hum? [the site appears in the browser] ""Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize!"" hoh, ahaha, ha."
1207,12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, time's up."
1208,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"No, wait, I I just clicked on the kitty. I got it. [the MP comes up and hauls him off too] No! It wasn't long enough! NOO!"
1209,12,6,Volunteer 2,"Next? Nelson, Peter T."
1210,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[approaches a volunteer] Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time."
1211,12,6,Volunteer 3,"Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get."
1212,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[grabs the volunteer's arm, takes him aside and says in a soft voice] I haven't jacked off in over two weeks."
1213,12,6,Volunteer 3,So jack off.
1214,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[lets go] You don't understand. [the volunteer crosses his arms] I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!"
1215,12,6,Volunteer 3,What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!
1216,12,6,Randy Marsh,Three minutes would be plenty.
1217,12,6,Volunteer 3,Get lost! [walks away]
1218,12,6,Randy Marsh,[feeling pain in his genitals] Ohhh.
1219,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"[handing out tickets to her children] All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet."
1220,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"What number are you, turd?"
1221,12,6,Stan Marsh,Eight fifty one.
1222,12,6,Shelly Marsh,[switches tickets with him] You're nine twenty three now.
1223,12,6,Stan Marsh,Hey! Mom!
1224,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"[returns] Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!"
1225,12,6,Shelly Marsh,Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! [runs away]
1226,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Psst. Hey! Over here! [Randy looks over, then walks to the man] You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?"
1227,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, how'd you know?"
1228,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy."
1229,12,6,Randy Marsh,"I know, right?"
1230,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say ""click""."
1231,12,6,Randy Marsh,"""Internet Porn Simulator"" [the tent is an ""Internet Porn Simulator. Whatever you want to see.""]"
1232,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Give it a try. [lifts up one of the entrance flaps for Randy. Randy enters and sees a makeshift computer on a desk. The monitor is a hollow box. Randy sits down. A hand descends into the hollow box holding a sheet of paper that says ""Anything you want to see with the click of a button!""]"
1233,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click. [the hand goes up, some scribbling is heard, and the hand comes down again with a picture of one Japanese stick figure pissing on another's face while the second stick figure lies on her back. This does not arouse him. He rolls away from the desk] Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this! [no one responds] Damn it. [rolls back to the desk and unzips his pants.] Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click. [gets ready to masturbate in anticipation. The picture comes down, and it's three black stick figures with their cocks out surrounding a Japanese stick figure.] Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click. [another picture comes down, this one of a stick-figure woman with a penis. Randy is grinding away down there] Bestiality? Click, click on that. [the next picture is that of a stick-figure man fucking a stick-figure pet in the ass. Randy is close to climax] Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click! [the next picture is that of a Brazilian stick-figure woman farting on a stick-figure man.] Dahya. [the climax fails to arrive] No. No, this isn't gonna work. [pounds his fist on the desk and walks out] It's just not the same."
1234,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card."
1235,12,6,Randy Marsh,[reaches into his back pocket for his wallet] Well at least that part's like the Internet.
1236,12,6,Anchorman,"We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!"
1237,12,6,Anchormen and Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again."
1238,12,6,General,"[through a megaphone] All right, Internet. What do you want from us? [the collosal router does not reply]  If we've angered you somehow, let us know. [lowers the megaphone] Try to communicate with it digitally again. [a scientist plays a few notes on a music keyboard. There's no reply. The scientist is about to play again when the original notes are sent back, with two others. That didn't go anywhere] I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! [a sniper fires at it, but the bullet had no effect. It just bounced off the router]"
1239,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, wait a minute. [gets off the couch and walks away to think alone] Is it possible that..."
1240,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[stands up] What is it, Kyle?"
1241,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,I think... I know what's wrong.
1242,12,6,Shelly Marsh,This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
1243,12,6,Stan Marsh,It's gotta be our turn soon.
1244,12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, folks, it's bed time. No more Internet for today."
1245,12,6,Internet Refugees,AWWW!!! [various protests are heard after this]
1246,12,6,Woman,A little closer!
1247,12,6,Volunteer 2,"No, no, we're locking it away until tomorrow. [the MPs unplug the computer and carry it and the desk away] Everyone get to bed!"
1248,12,6,Internet Refugees,"Aw man! [everyone walks off mumbling, disappointed]"
1249,12,6,Woman,Wha?![puts her left hand on her head and walks off with her head tilted back]
1250,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"Gggggyyaaah! [punches Stan away, then walks away in the other direction]"
1251,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes! [softly as he types] Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. [click. He finds a page right away. The girls are only heard, not shown]"
1252,12,6,Girl 1,"Haro Kiti kawaii n desho? [""Hello Kitty is cute, isn't it?"" puke]"
1253,12,6,Girl 2,"Un. Choukawaii yo ne! [""Yes. Super cute, right?!"" puke]"
1254,12,6,Randy Marsh,Oh niice... Whoa... [begins masturbating]
1255,12,6,Girl 1,"Watashi wa... daisuki! [""I"" puke ""love it!""]"
1256,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[types away] Now let's see some bestiality. [click. The sound of a woman being rammed by an elephant is heard. Randy is hitting his stride, then heads towards climax] Aahahaha, yes! Ogh! [types away] Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there! [click. The Brazilian fart porn fetish page loads.] Oh that's good eh! Oh! [a view from outside the shed] Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! [other refugees here this and walk out of their tents to see what's going on. Sharon and the kids are out too, but they don't say a thing.]"
1257,12,6,Refugee Man 2,What is that?
1258,12,6,Refugee Man 4,Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.
1259,12,6,Randy Marsh,Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
1260,12,6,Volunteer 4,"Get the keys! We gotta get in there. [volunteer 2 runs to the door and whips out his keys. Three other volunteers, one of them a woman, follow him up. They get the door open and enter the shed]"
1261,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[voice descending] Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! [the oldest volunteer turns on the lights and they all gasp in shock. Randy is spent, his semen all over the room, the desk, the computer, and himself.]"
1262,12,6,Volunteer 2,What the...? [Sharon and the kids rush in]
1263,12,6,Stan Marsh,Dad?
1264,12,6,Sharon Marsh,Randy!
1265,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[trying to explain it away] Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm! [volunteer 4 heads for the computer] Did you see the ghost? [the volunteer begins typing on the keyboard] It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!"
1266,12,6,Volunteer 2,You son of a bitch!
1267,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! [volunteer 4 looks back at Randy, who looks back at him]"
1268,12,6,Anchormen and Field Reporter,"This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy [Kyle is shown standing before the router] to attempt his method to get the Internet running again. [shots of this breaking news airing all over the U.S.] It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?"
1269,12,6,Scientist 1,All clear for procedure.
1270,12,6,General,"All right! Let's do it! [Kyle walks forward, then up the ramp. His parents fear for him. He walks up and to the right, sees the massive plug and walks to the socket. He just pulls the plug out, waits a few seconds, and plugs it back in. The router responds with a full green signal.]"
1271,12,6,Scientist 2,Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
1272,12,6,Scientist 1,He did it!
1273,12,6,Scientist 3,I've got Internet!
1274,12,6,Scientist 4,Me too!
1275,12,6,Scientist 5,"Internet activity in all sectors, sir. [everyone cheers. Kyle looks around a little puzzled]"
1276,12,6,Transient Man 5,I've got Internet.
1277,12,6,Transient Man 6,Me too!
1278,12,6,Transient Man 3,It's back! [everyone begins to cheer there too]
1279,12,6,Anchorman,It's back? It's back! [the two anchors dance a jig]
1280,12,6,Shelly Marsh,It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! [a boy in the background turns around and looks at Shelly]
1281,12,6,Amir,Shelly. Shelly Marsh? [both Shelly and Stan turn around to look at him]
1282,12,6,Shelly Marsh,What?
1283,12,6,Amir,It's me. Amir.
1284,12,6,Shelly Marsh,O... kay.
1285,12,6,Amir,"Your family came here too, huh?"
1286,12,6,Shelly Marsh,[bashful] Yeah. [the two of them look away from each other]
1287,12,6,Amir,"So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home."
1288,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"Yeah, okay. Sounds good."
1289,12,6,Amir,"Okay, s-see ya. [turns around and walks away]"
1290,12,6,Shelly Marsh,[turns around and skips away] We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!
1291,12,6,Randy Marsh,"And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT [pounds the podium hard with his right fist. A few people are startled by this] that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally, [the head of a bald eagle appears on the screen behind him.] We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. [everyone applauds him, then gives him a standing ovation. He has his left arm up and fist pumped.]"
1292,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. [the bearded employee steps forward, his hands gripping his suspenders]"
1293,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?"
1294,12,7,Stan Marsh,Ughh.
1295,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,This is gonna suck.
1296,12,7,Pioneer Paul,When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome. [tips his hat a bit to the class] To 1864. Set 'em up!
1297,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Thank you, Pioneer Paul. [Pioneer Paul turns around and walks away.] All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. [the students look at each other and begin to pair off.]"
1298,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Let's be partners, Kenny."
1299,12,7,Kenny McCormick,"(No, I'm partners with Craig) [holds Craig's hand]"
1300,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay. [turns and follows Stan] Stan, let's be partners, dude. [Stan approaches Wendy and holds out his hand. She takes it]"
1301,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Naw, I'm with Wendy."
1302,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad! [Wendy flashes him an angry look as he turns and walks away. He looks around and sees most everyone is paired off. He approaches Kyle] All right, let's be partners, Kyle."
1303,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I hate you, remember? [turns away] You wanna be partners, Jimmy?"
1304,12,7,Eric Cartman,"[miffed] Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token? [Clyde and Token pair up] Who, who else needs a partner? [after the rest of the kids have paired up, only Butters is left. Cartman looks at him and he gets bashful all of a sudden, brushing his left foot back and forth on the ground] Uh who else needs a partner?"
1305,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Eric, partner with Butters."
1306,12,7,Eric Cartman,God damn it!
1307,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Hold Butters' hand, Eric! [Butters motions for Cartman to take his hand]"
1308,12,7,Eric Cartman,That isn't necessary!
1309,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!"
1310,12,7,Butters Stotch,I understand. [takes Cartman's hand as Garrison turns towards the village]
1311,12,7,Mr Garrison,"All right, let's head in. [leads the way]"
1312,12,7,Eric Cartman,"You can let go now, Butters."
1313,12,7,Butters Stotch,[firmly] No.
1314,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, come on!"
1315,12,7,Butters Stotch,"No! [the class is at the center of the village. Around it are a carriage house, the saloon, and the feed and tackle store]"
1316,12,7,Mr Garrison,"All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff. [the pairs disperse] Keep track of your partner!"
1317,12,7,Smithy,"Why howdy partners. [puts his tools down] I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through?"
1318,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her."
1319,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Thanks, Stan."
1320,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"[dropping by] These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?"
1321,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,[points to the smithy] That guy is wearing a digital watch.
1322,12,7,Smithy,Oh jeez. [adjust the watch to hide it. Pioneer Paul gives him an angry look]
1323,12,7,Pioneer Paul,Damn it Chad!
1324,12,7,Chad,"[puts it in his pocket] S-sorry, I'm sorry."
1325,12,7,Gunsmith,"Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns."
1326,12,7,Eric Cartman,I wanna shoot an Indian.
1327,12,7,Gunsmith,"Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store. [Kenny, Craig, and the two girls leave. Cartman and Butters head for the holes in the wall]"
1328,12,7,Butters Stotch,Do you see any Indians?
1329,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs. [just over the greenery is Super Phun Thyme, a small attraction next door.] ""Super... Phun Thyme."" [turns to Butters and has him step forward] Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!"
1330,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh, that's cool. [steps back and turns around] Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone."
1331,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!"
1332,12,7,Butters Stotch,Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
1333,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Fine, then let go of my hand!"
1334,12,7,Butters Stotch,Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
1335,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!"
1336,12,7,Butters Stotch,I'm not lettin' go!
1337,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Fine, then you're comin' with me!"
1338,12,7,Butters Stotch,"No, Eric! [trips and stands up. Cartman pulls him towards the village's entrance]"
1339,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, let go God-damn it!"
1340,12,7,Butters Stotch,No! [trips and tries to stand up] T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!
1341,12,7,Pioneer Paul,This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.
1342,12,7,Clerk,Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
1343,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then."
1344,12,7,Clerk,"What do you mean ""back then""? Don't forget, it's 1864."
1345,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,Right. Except for it really isn't.
1346,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye. [they look around, but the modern sound of sirens reaches their ears]"
1347,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
1348,12,7,Stan Marsh,Sounds like police sirens.
1349,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864. [the sound of screeching tires is next, and everyone heads to the windows to find out. A big SUV pulls into the village and seven people pour out of it. One of them is injured]"
1350,12,7,Leader,"We lost them, we lost them!"
1351,12,7,Injured Man,Damn pig cops!
1352,12,7,Leader,Close that gate! [two of his henchmen close the gate]
1353,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,What's going on?
1354,12,7,Stan Marsh,I don't know. [the gunmen gather up the students and adults]
1355,12,7,Leader,Everyone down on the ground NOW!
1356,12,7,Sheriff McLawdog,"Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif- [the leader shoots him in the forehead with a silenced gun]"
1357,12,7,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ! [the six of them move away from the window and drop to their knees] We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
1358,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing."
1359,12,7,Stan Marsh,What?!
1360,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, this is serious!"
1361,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?"
1362,12,7,Clerk,"Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time."
1363,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!"
1364,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West."
1365,12,7,Stan Marsh,[in no mood to hear about it] This is not the time for that!
1366,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, this is gonna be awesome! [the go through the double doors] Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!"
1367,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Well, that's your problem!"
1368,12,7,Eric Cartman,"All right Butters, I've seriously had enough! [tries to rip his hand out of Butters' grip, but only succeeds in pulling Butters around. He tries again, but Butters isn't letting go. He tries a third time, all the way around, and Butters' hand is clamped on tight.] Jesus Christ! [drops the matter and goes to a counter with Butters] One please."
1369,12,7,Butters Stotch,Make that two! [they each give $6.]
1370,12,7,Super Phun Thyme Cashier,"Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?"
1371,12,7,Butters Stotch,NO! [she gives them their tickets and they go into the attraction]
1372,12,7,Eric Cartman,NO! [she gives them their tickets and they go into the attraction]
1373,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?"
1374,12,7,Butters Stotch,"We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!"
1375,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! [yanks Butters along.]"
1376,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,Over here. This looks like an office.
1377,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[opens the door and leads the others in, then spots the phone] Here! Here's the phone! [Wendy gets on the stool and tries to dial out]"
1378,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Well, what a straaange contraption."
1379,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"I can't get a dial tone. [Kyle listens, then lowers the receiver]"
1380,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,What's the number to dial out?
1381,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'."
1382,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! [Kyle and Wendy trade places]"
1383,12,7,Clerk,"Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-"
1384,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"[grabs him by the collar and shoves him against the door] Brresh! [points something out to him. It's a sign over the door: ""Remember: Never Break Character!""]"
1385,12,7,Clerk,"Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time."
1386,12,7,Pioneer Paul,I'll say.
1387,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I got through. Hello, police?"
1388,12,7,Operator,"Nine one one, what's your emergency?"
1389,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
1390,12,7,Operator,Taken hostage where?
1391,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
1392,12,7,Operator,You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
1393,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[glances back at the two men] Sister, you don't know the half of it."
1394,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!"
1395,12,7,Eric Cartman,I'm having a super fun time playin'
1396,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here! [next they're playing air hockey. They take turns, but still have to run together in switching sides. They run to Butters' side and Butters hits the puck] Oh, you got it. Nice. [they run to Cartman's side, and Cartman hits the puck. They run back to Butters' side...]"
1397,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Super fun time, please don't go awahay."
1398,12,7,Butters Stotch,What are you whoofelin' at? [the couple hurries away]
1399,12,7,Eric Cartman,"No more worries or cares, super fun time."
1400,12,7,Eric Cartman,"[on a Road Hogg motorcycle ride as Butters gets on] Waiwait, keep- you're fine. [starts the ride. The motorcycle rocks back and forth quickly] Oh man, whoa!"
1401,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Whoa! [gets tossed into the air, but doesn't let go of Cartman's hand. He ends up on Cartman's lap before the ride ends]"
1402,12,7,Eric Cartman,"The answer to my prayers, super fun time.
Super fun time, you're all I need."
1403,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeheah, we're wired up!"
1404,12,7,Eric Cartman,"I'll have a super fun time till I freakin; bleed.
I love you mornin' noon and night, super fun time."
1405,12,7,Eric Cartman,"[two cars bump into him] Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! [Butters is battered]"
1406,12,7,Eric Cartman,"You make my life so right, super fun time."
1407,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!"
1408,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw, just a few more things."
1409,12,7,Butters Stotch,"No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!"
1410,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. [they leave Super Phun Thyme]"
1411,12,7,Leader,"Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area. [turns to the hostage group] Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination."
1412,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. [the kids are shocked at him. The sirens are heard again]"
1413,12,7,Blond,How did they find us?!
1414,12,7,Leader,Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building. [a bunch of police cars show up at the parking lot and their officers quickly get out and get into position]
1415,12,7,Police Chief,"All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage."
1416,12,7,Lieutenant,"Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!"
1417,12,7,Police Chief,Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!
1418,12,7,Officer 2,"What did they rob, sir?"
1419,12,7,Police Chief,A Burger King.
1420,12,7,Leader,"All right, good. Is that all of it? [a big balding man comes in with several Burger King meals in bags]"
1421,12,7,Balding Man,No. Don't forget we've got these too.
1422,12,7,Leader,"Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan. [pulls out a cell phone and dials some numbers.] I'd like to speak with the chief of police! [listens] Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!"
1423,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,Why aren't the cops coming in?
1424,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,They must be negotiating.
1425,12,7,Pioneer Paul,Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
1426,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,[annoyed] Will you shut up!
1427,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Wait, you have guns here?"
1428,12,7,Pioneer Paul,Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.
1429,12,7,Stan Marsh,Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
1430,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"All righty. Come on, storehand."
1431,12,7,Clerk,Yeppir! [they leave]
1432,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village."
1433,12,7,Butters Stotch,We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
1434,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it."
1435,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true."
1436,12,7,Eric Cartman,"[stops in his tracks] Uh oh. [sees the police at the Pioneer Village entrance.] Crap, they called the cops on us."
1437,12,7,Butters Stotch,What?! They called the cops?!
1438,12,7,Eric Cartman,They must have realized we left. Damn.
1439,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh my God, the police are looking for us!"
1440,12,7,Eric Cartman,[covers Cartman's mouth and takes him behind a mail box] Shhh! Butters!
1441,12,7,Butters Stotch,[quickly upset] We're gonna get it now!
1442,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!"
1443,12,7,Butters Stotch,You just got me busted forever!
1444,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, l-listen to me, listen."
1445,12,7,Butters Stotch,No! [turns away]
1446,12,7,Eric Cartman,All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
1447,12,7,Butters Stotch,You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. [punches him softly on the chest with his free hand]
1448,12,7,Eric Cartman,"If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right? [Butters calms down and stops sobbing] All right, now let go of my hand."
1449,12,7,Butters Stotch,No.
1450,12,7,Eric Cartman,Butters?
1451,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now."
1452,12,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, come on! [they head back towards Super Phun Thyme]"
1453,12,7,Leader,"Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich."
1454,12,7,Ohrlich,The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.
1455,12,7,Leader,Above ground?
1456,12,7,Ohrlich,"Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft, [a picture of an abandoned gold mine appears] but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock."
1457,12,7,Leader,So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.
1458,12,7,Ohrlich,"One more thing, Frans: I want my share of the take now."
1459,12,7,Frans,"[finally, a name for the leader] What's the matter, Ohrlich? Lose your sense of trust?"
1460,12,7,Ohrlich,I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.
1461,12,7,Frans,"Very well. [hands him a wad of bills and a Burger King lunch bag. Ohrlich opens the bag, takes out his burger, and leafs through its contents like a deck of playing cards to make sure nothing is missing]"
1462,12,7,Frans,"I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!"
1463,12,7,Smithy,"I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village. [the woman strikes his face again with her rifle] OW."
1464,12,7,Frans,"[holds up the smithy's employee profile] You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons, [reads from the profile] Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!"
1465,12,7,Smithy,"Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the- [the woman strikes his face again with her rifle] OW."
1466,12,7,Frans,That's it! [aims his gun at Smithy's left temple. The woman backs away] Tell me the code or you die! [the smithy sobs] One... two...
1467,12,7,Smithy,I...
1468,12,7,Frans,Yes?
1469,12,7,Smithy,I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith. [Frans kills him and his body drops off the chair. The class and the pioneer villagers but Craig are stunned]
1470,12,7,Craig Tucker,[observes] These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. [another worker is tied up and put on the chair as the smithy's body is dragged away]
1471,12,7,Worker,No. Please. Don't hurt me.
1472,12,7,Frans,Give us the code to that door and we can leave!
1473,12,7,Worker,"[shuts his eyes hard] I've never heard of sss-something called a door code. [leans over and whispers] Please, can't you ask some other way?"
1474,12,7,Frans,"I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now! [gets his gun ready]"
1475,12,7,Worker,"All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2 [he's killed, but by someone else. The class and the pioneer villagers gasp when it sees whom the killer is. Pioneer Paul is shown with a rifle in his hand, and the general store clerk is next to him]"
1476,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"[tosses his rifle away and walks to the class] What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich."
1477,12,7,Frans,God damn it you people are fucking insane!
1478,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't believe it.
1479,12,7,Frans,"Domino, [looks at the balding man, then at another henchman] Walsky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them! [the two henchmen move out]"
1480,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! [they start to move.]"
1481,12,7,Jimmy Valmer,Yeah. [all stop] We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. [they finally leave]
1482,12,7,Officer 2,"Sector Bravo, no activity."
1483,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere."
1484,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside. [turns left and points] Look, see that traffic signal down there? [the intersection is shown] If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free."
1485,12,7,Butters Stotch,That looks dangerous.
1486,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on. [they head to the signal. Butters is lighter, so he goes up first. He pulls Cartman along up the traffic signal, then stands on the arm] Good, that's good. [Cartman stands up too] That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across. [they begin to tip-toe along the traffic signal's arm.] Go easy. Good."
1487,12,7,Butters Stotch,Oh gosh in heaven.
1488,12,7,Eric Cartman,"It's all right. You've got it, no problem- [his left foot slips, causing them both to lose their balance] OP."
1489,12,7,Butters Stotch,Whoa!
1490,12,7,Eric Cartman,Save me!
1491,12,7,Butters Stotch,"I'm gonna fall! [they both scream as they struggle to stay on the arm, but they both fall off... and end up hanging from the arm like a pair of tennis shoes tied together]"
1492,12,7,Eric Cartman,"... Oh dude, laaame."
1493,12,7,Frans,"Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?"
1494,12,7,Domino,We found somebody. [the two henchmen he sent off earlier return]
1495,12,7,Walsky,We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.
1496,12,7,Pioneer Paul,[gasps] You let out Murderin' Murphy?
1497,12,7,Murderin Murphy,Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!
1498,12,7,Frans,[frustrated and pissed off] Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!
1499,12,7,Woman,Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
1500,12,7,Frans,[approaching the employees] I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!
1501,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all."
1502,12,7,Frans,I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM! [walks over to the students...]
1503,12,7,Mr Garrison,Not me! Not me not me not me not me! [...and grabs Kenny]
1504,12,7,Kenny McCormick,"(What? Hey, let go.)"
1505,12,7,Frans,[drags Kenny to the employees] Do you want to see a child die?!
1506,12,7,Kenny McCormick,(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
1507,12,7,Butters Stotch,"I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!"
1508,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look! [a big truck is headed their way] This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!"
1509,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Huh... [swings over, and they both land on the truck. They then move about looking for a good position to jump from]"
1510,12,7,Eric Cartman,Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
1511,12,7,Butters Stotch,Let's do it!
1512,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Ready? Go! [they leap off the truck and over the wooden wall. The police are not aware of this. They land on a roof and roll of it into a wooden wheelbarrow, which tips over and dumps them onto the ground.]"
1513,12,7,Frans,"[Domino and Walsky bring the female employee over to Kenny, who is tied up on the chair] What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!"
1514,12,7,Woman,"I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper."
1515,12,7,Frans,God damn it!
1516,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!"
1517,12,7,Stan Marsh,"I can't let them do it. [comes out from under the table] I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. [turns and heads for the door, then exits the building]"
1518,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,Stan?
1519,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[leans out] Where are you going, Stan?"
1520,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. [turns around, grabs some dirt, rubs it on his face, and walks to the hostage area]"
1521,12,7,Frans,"All right, that does it! [jabs the tip of the gun up against Kenny's hood. Kenny just looks at him] On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!"
1522,12,7,Kenny McCormick,"(God damn it, someone help me!)"
1523,12,7,Stan Marsh,"[walks up] Well howdy there, strangers. [everyone looks at him as he approaches] Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich.."
1524,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Ohhh, welcome, partner. [the other employees welcome him as well.]"
1525,12,7,Frans,Wha-what are you doing?
1526,12,7,Stan Marsh,I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
1527,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa."
1528,12,7,Murderin Murphy,They killed my pahr!
1529,12,7,Stan Marsh,"I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe."
1530,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Y-y-yeah, I understand that."
1531,12,7,Clerk,"Finally, a fella that talks some sense."
1532,12,7,Stan Marsh,"If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?"
1533,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864."
1534,12,7,Clerk,"Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is."
1535,12,7,Frans,"Eighteen sixty four. Ohrlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us! [smiles]"
1536,12,7,Mr Garrison,"No, you got your door code, let us go!"
1537,12,7,Walsky,"Copy that. What's the code, over. [Butters and Cartman step out from behind a building, then quickly step back behind it before they can be seen]"
1538,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters. [they step out again and walk towards Walsky, who gets ready to shoot] Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?"
1539,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, it sure has."
1540,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm."
1541,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh..."
1542,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome."
1543,12,7,Butters Stotch,Been a hoot all right!
1544,12,7,Walsky,Get your hands behind your head!
1545,12,7,Eric Cartman,What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
1546,12,7,Walsky,"Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now! [they put their free hands behind their heads, which surprises him] Let go of each other!"
1547,12,7,Butters Stotch,Huh uh.
1548,12,7,Walsky,Do what I tell you!
1549,12,7,Butters Stotch,Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
1550,12,7,Walsky,Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
1551,12,7,Eric Cartman,Butters.
1552,12,7,Walsky,Now!
1553,12,7,Butters Stotch,"No! [remembering how Cartman swung him around at Super Phun Thyme, he swings Cartman around and knocks Walsky down. He and Cartman sprint across the field and manage to avoid the barrage of bullets Wilskey sends their way]"
1554,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Christ! [Walsky fires off a grenade, which hits a house just as Cartman and Butters run past it. The blast blows them off their feet]"
1555,12,7,Butters Stotch,AAAAH!
1556,12,7,Eric Cartman,AAAAH! [this and the gunfire alert the other robbers]
1557,12,7,Frans,Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages! [the gunwoman and Ohrlich leave]
1558,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?"
1559,12,7,Murderin Murphy,Yeah.
1560,12,7,Stan Marsh,He done killed yer pahr.
1561,12,7,Murderin Murphy,[stands up enraged] What?! Well I'll rip his head off! [runs towards Frans and tackles him]
1562,12,7,Officer 2,We've got a chance. Hostages are clear! [officers climb over the wooden wall and pour into the village.]
1563,12,7,Frans,"They are coming in! [the shootout between cops and robbers begins. Ohrlich is shot dead and his burger drops to the floor next to him. The gunwoman fires, and the cops fire back. She is shot through a window and dies.]"
1564,12,7,Mr Garrison,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
1565,12,7,Officer 3,"Whoa, no, no!"
1566,12,7,Officer 2,Hostages are secure at the park entrance!
1567,12,7,Murderin Murphy,"I got you now, Pioneer Paul!"
1568,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy! [they get into a fistfight. Domino shoots at the cops from the second floor of the saloon. The cops fire back and Domino keels over, dead. Frans walks over to Ohrlich's body and takes back his cut]"
1569,12,7,Police Chief,"[arrives and aims his gun] Freeze, scumbag! It's all over! [Other officers gather and aim their weapons. Frans drops his satchel and puts his hands behind his head.]"
1570,12,7,Woman,Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!
1571,12,7,Officer 2,[aims his gun at the men] Stop right now! It's over! [a bell rings out three tones and the fistfight ends]
1572,12,7,PA System,"Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day. [Murphy and Paul let go of each other and stand up smiling] Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home."
1573,12,7,Pioneer Paul,We made it!
1574,12,7,Murderin Murphy,We made it! [the employees hug each other and begin to disperse]
1575,12,7,Woman 2,"Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress."
1576,12,7,Murderin Murphy,"Whoa, that was great! [the employees begin to drop their makeup and other bits of costume]"
1577,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!"
1578,12,7,Gunsmith,Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeño poppers!
1579,12,7,Murderin Murphy,"Yeah, that'd be great!"
1580,12,7,Man 1,All right!
1581,12,7,Man 2,"Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers."
1582,12,7,Man 3,"Let's go, huh."
1583,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork."
1584,12,7,Stan Marsh,I know.
1585,12,7,Police Chief,Come on you!
1586,12,7,Frans,You're hurting my arm!
1587,12,7,Police Chief,Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?
1588,12,7,Frans,"In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all."
1589,12,7,Police Chief,That's true. [Frans is put in a squad car and the cops continue with their work]
1590,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[looks at Pioneer Village] Hey look. [Butters walks towards the entrance dragging Cartman behind him. Cartman is passed out. Butters drags him over the sidewalk, across the parking lot, and on to the bus. Only then does he let go]"
1591,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! [all energy leaves him and he passes out too]"
1592,12,8,Announcer,Welcome to the televised broadcast of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies from Beijing. [fireworks enter the stadium and the drum roll begins. The drummers are bent over their drums as lights in the drums flash on and off] Thousands of Chinese performers playing ancient Chinese drums. [the roll ends in a wave of drummers standing up straight and not drumming] The precision of their movements made even more impressive by their massive numbers. [all the drummers strike their drums at once and the light display resumes]
1593,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[dreaming about being at the Opening Ceremonies] No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them! [The stadium lights come up and the drummers resume their drumming. Cartman is getting restless] No! No!"
1594,12,8,Liane Cartman,"[knocks on his door] Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?"
1595,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[talking in his sleep] They're gonna... take over the world! HAA! [The drummers start up again] Too many of them. [Cartman now dreams of walking among the drummers] No! Leave us alone! [The drummers strike solidly on their drums, and Cartman now finds himself bouncing on the drums as they rise and fall under him] Nooo! [Four different groups of Chinese Olympians surround him. Cartman wakes from his nightmare and checks his face to be sure he's not dreaming] Damn it no! No!"
1596,12,8,Liane Cartman,"[quickly enters the room, turns on the light and comes to his side] Sweetiekins, are you all right?"
1597,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me."
1598,12,8,Liane Cartman,"[consoles him] No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you."
1599,12,8,Eric Cartman,[sobbing] They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
1600,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[being serious] All right. Guys, we need to talk. [no response from the other three] You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something. [the other boys stay silent] Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?"
1601,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps forward, away from the others] I'm sorry. [holds his palms up and out, then shakes them as if to hold off something] I I'm sorry, I can't do this. [then lowers them] I'm not doing this. [walks off to his right]"
1602,12,8,Stan Marsh,"[stops Kyle in his tracks just by saying] Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?"
1603,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! [walks away. The other boys look at him, Stan a bit shocked]"
1604,12,8,Kenny McCormick,(Damn.)
1605,12,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. [Kyle doesn't reply. Stan sighs, closes the door and approaches him] Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go."
1606,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't."
1607,12,8,Stan Marsh,"Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on."
1608,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[leaves his desk angrily and faces Stan] Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did [takes his hands, puts them side by side, and sweeps them out away from each other] nothing!"
1609,12,8,Stan Marsh,"There was nothing we could do, Kyle! [Kyle walks away. Stan says softly] There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there."
1610,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,[turns around and faces Stan] Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
1611,12,8,Stan Marsh,How?
1612,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away again] I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again. [clenches his fists at the thought of it, then loosens the grips and turns around] And because we did nothing... they got away."
1613,12,8,Stan Marsh,"You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go."
1614,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[wipes something from his forehead] I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. [walks out of the room. Stan watches him leave, then sighs]"
1615,12,8,Stan Marsh,[puts his hands in his jacket pockets] God damn it.
1616,12,8,Butters Stotch,Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
1617,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[bursts into the bathroom, startling Butters] There you are, Butters!"
1618,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh, Eric."
1619,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I need your help."
1620,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent."
1621,12,8,Eric Cartman,"The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!"
1622,12,8,Butters Stotch,The Chinese?
1623,12,8,Eric Cartman,"I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now."
1624,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad."
1625,12,8,Eric Cartman,"You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!"
1626,12,8,Butters Stotch,Why are they gonna kill my parents?
1627,12,8,Eric Cartman,Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny. [with determination] Will you join me?
1628,12,8,Butters Stotch,I don't want my parents to die.
1629,12,8,Eric Cartman,[hops onto the stool] So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
1630,12,8,Butters Stotch,Well sure.
1631,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[cups Butters' right hand between his own two hands] You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese."
1632,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, [pounds his left fist into the water] fuck 'em."
1633,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,No... No! [he's having a nightmare] No...
1634,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!"
1635,12,8,Stan Marsh,Let's get out of here!
1636,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,We can't just leave!
1637,12,8,Stan Marsh,Come on!
1638,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,Aw it's horrible! [we now join the dream already in progress]
1639,12,8,Stan Marsh,Oh God!
1640,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,Somebody do something!
1641,12,8,Clyde Donovan,Why are they doing this?!
1642,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're... [blinks hard] they're raping him! [Stan quickly covers his eyes]
1643,12,8,Stan Marsh,"I can't watch! [uncovers his eyes and rises from his seat] Let's get out of here Kyle! [leaves. Kenny follows him out of the row, then Clyde, Butters, and Jimmy.]"
1644,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
1645,12,8,Stan Marsh,COME ON LET'S GO! [grabs Kyle by the right hand and drags him out]
1646,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
1647,12,8,Stan Marsh,JUST RUN!! [the six boys run out of there.]
1648,12,8,Clyde Donovan,"Oh God, what have they done?!"
1649,12,8,Stan Marsh,Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie? [Kyle throws up] Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
1650,12,8,Clyde Donovan,[in despair] Whyyy? Whyyy?? [Kenny runs around is disbelief]
1651,12,8,Jimmy Valmer,We can't help him now.
1652,12,8,Butters Stotch,Well I thought it was pretty good.
1653,12,8,Stan Marsh,"Let's just go, Let's just go! [grabs Kyle's right hand and pulls him away from the theater]"
1654,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,[suddenly wakes up] NOO! [sits on the edge of his bed.] Noo. No. Awwh. [sobs softly in relief] Aw no...
1655,12,8,Eric Cartman,"All right Butters, we're here. [sets the duffle bag down] Are you ready?"
1656,12,8,Butters Stotch,"I'm scared, but I know my country needs me."
1657,12,8,Eric Cartman,"This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now. [points at something across the street - a P.F. Chang's China Bistro] Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. [opens the duffle bag and begins to search through it]"
1658,12,8,Butters Stotch,"But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?"
1659,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them. [pulls out a Chinese peasant hat] Here, put these teeth in! [hands him some buck teeth] And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot. [puts in his own buck teeth and squints his eyes] ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong."
1660,12,8,Butters Stotch,Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
1661,12,8,Greeter,[a woman] Uhh welcome to P.F. Chang's. I'll be right with you. [turns to other guests]
1662,12,8,Butters Stotch,"[leans over] Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese."
1663,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[panics, voice rising] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!"
1664,12,8,Butters Stotch,[walks up to him] What?
1665,12,8,Eric Cartman,It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
1666,12,8,Greeter,"Uh, can I help you?"
1667,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Ah yes, herro prease. [puts his hands together and bows a bit] We are Chinese peopull."
1668,12,8,Butters Stotch,[also bows] Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.
1669,12,8,Greeter,"Uh yeah, why don't I seat you over here? [they follow her to their table and take their seats. She gives them their menus] Your waitress will be right with you."
1670,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Fruttar sheshar. [the greeter leaves] What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck! [goes into hushed tones and points] There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there! [Butters leans over and looks back. Sure enough, a Chinese family of five is looking at them] Do you see them?"
1671,12,8,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
1672,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out."
1673,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Stay calm, Eric."
1674,12,8,Eric Cartman,"They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go- [Butters smacks him, shutting him up] Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats. [they make their way to the family's table] Oh, herro, prease, herro."
1675,12,8,Butters Stotch,"[bows a bit] Herro, prease."
1676,12,8,Eric Cartman,"So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves."
1677,12,8,Butters Stotch,Fing fong ting tong.
1678,12,8,Eric Cartman,Ting ton teetong.
1679,12,8,Mother,他们在干什么啊？[subtitled] What are they doing?
1680,12,8,Father,诶，我真的不知道。[subtitled] I don't know.
1681,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, [gibberish] So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. [snickers. The family just stares at them]"
1682,12,8,Stan Marsh,"[walks into view] Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle. [walks towards the shore] You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same."
1683,12,8,Jimmy Valmer,"And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen."
1684,12,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it."
1685,12,8,Jimmy Valmer,"I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same. [Stan turns right and sighs] Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator? [Stan turns his head to look back] It didn't make any sense, Stan."
1686,12,8,Stan Marsh,[turns to face Jimmy] I don't need this now. [looks away and closes his eyes] I just want things to be the way they were! [runs off]
1687,12,8,Jimmy Valmer,"[turns left to follow Stan's path] You can't run away from it forever, [faces the lake again] Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow."
1688,12,8,Stan Marsh,Indiana Jones! All right! [The screen is shown: Indy is at the foot of a long set of stairs]
1689,12,8,Indy,"[turns to face Stan] Hey there, Stan. All set to see my new adventure?"
1690,12,8,Stan Marsh,"[happily] You bet, Indiana! [Stan's jaw drops. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas walk up behind Indy, smiling] No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!"
1691,12,8,Steven Spielberg,Well well hello there Indiana. [rubs Indy's left shoulder]
1692,12,8,George Lucas,[pats Indy's back lovingly] You're looking cute. [they begin to rough him up]
1693,12,8,Stan Marsh,No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! [they begin to disrobe Indy]
1694,12,8,Steven Spielberg,Oh yeah! [Spielberg rips Indy's shirt open]
1695,12,8,Indy,No! [Stan covers his mouth in disbelief and alarm]
1696,12,8,Stan Marsh,Indy! [Lucas and Spielberg now have Indy pinned to the ground]
1697,12,8,George Lucas,Yeah! Get down! Get back down! [Spielberg pulls down Indy's pants as Indy wails]
1698,12,8,Steven Spielberg,"Hold him, Lucas! Come on!"
1699,12,8,George Lucas,[holding Indy down] Heheh! He-he ain't goin' nowhere!
1700,12,8,Steven Spielberg,[gets on top of Indy] Yeah!
1701,12,8,Stan Marsh,"No, stop! Raape!"
1702,12,8,Indy,"HOOOOOOOOO! [the daydream ends and Stan has tears in his eyes. He breaks down and falls on all fours, weeping. He raises his face and fist to the sky and continues weeping]"
1703,12,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!"
1704,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Okay, okay."
1705,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran."
1706,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Huh, invasion pran."
1707,12,8,Eric Cartman,What day is American invasion again? I fohget. [snickers]
1708,12,8,Father,"'Scuse me, miss?"
1709,12,8,Greeter,Yes sir?
1710,12,8,Father,These people won't leave us alone.
1711,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[thinks a bit] ...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull."
1712,12,8,Father,You aren't Chinese.
1713,12,8,Eric Cartman,Oh my God...
1714,12,8,Butters Stotch,We're busted! Uh what do we do??
1715,12,8,Greeter,"Okay, why don't we go..."
1716,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?! [moves into the main area of the restaurant] Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies! [a couple stops eating] The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall! [points to his right] I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. [pulls a gun from a pocket and hands it to Butters]"
1717,12,8,Butters Stotch,A gun?
1718,12,8,Eric Cartman,Hold the gun on them Butters!
1719,12,8,Butters Stotch,"I don't want a gun, Eric!"
1720,12,8,Eric Cartman,"They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!"
1721,12,8,Butters Stotch,Oh jeez...
1722,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move! [the guests rise from their seats with their hands up and move over to the wall Cartman pointed to] We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!"
1723,12,8,Patron,This is stupid. I'm leaving!
1724,12,8,Eric Cartman,Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
1725,12,8,Patron,[walks towards the front doors] Screw you!
1726,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Shoot him, Butters!"
1727,12,8,Butters Stotch,No!
1728,12,8,Eric Cartman,"You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!"
1729,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Waah! [looks away with his eyes shut and shoots at the patron. The bullet hits the patron in the groin, which splatters all over his clothes. The patron puts his hands over his crotch in pain]"
1730,12,8,Patron,Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!
1731,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw dude, you shot him in the dick."
1732,12,8,Butters Stotch,Huh?
1733,12,8,Eric Cartman,That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
1734,12,8,Butters Stotch,"But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-"
1735,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[faces him] It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters."
1736,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I [sniffs and wipes his nose with his right hand] I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible."
1737,12,8,DA,[looking through the paperwork] You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.
1738,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day. [sniffs and wipes his nose with his right hand] But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone."
1739,12,8,Stan Marsh,"You aren't alone. [he enters the room with Kenny, Clyde, and Jimmy]"
1740,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,[gets off the chair] Stan?
1741,12,8,Stan Marsh,We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again. [begins to cry and leans into Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him and begins to cry. The other boys cry as well] I love you.
1742,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,I love you too.
1743,12,8,DA,"[interrupts the crying] Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous."
1744,12,8,Stan Marsh,Wh-why?
1745,12,8,DA,You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.
1746,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,[points at him] Did you see it?
1747,12,8,DA,"Yes I saw it, but I- [his face drops and he turns away] But I just try not to think about it."
1748,12,8,Stan Marsh,Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
1749,12,8,DA,"I don't know what I saw! [crosses his arms] All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-"
1750,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,Indy deserved more than that!
1751,12,8,DA,"[wheels around] GET OUT! JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! [the boys leave, and the DA slams the door shut on them. The DA returns to his desk, sits in his chair, and begins to cry. He remembers the scene this way:] No, no... [pounds his desk]"
1752,12,8,Steven Spielberg,"Well well, Indiana Jones. [the DA is playing on a different arcade game] You're looking nice. [the pinball machine the DA is at has a Willow theme all over; the one Indy is at has a Howard the Duck theme. Lucas has Indy pinned on the machine with his pants down.  Spielberg unbuttons Indy's shirt and starts licking his nipples.]"
1753,12,8,Indy,Hey. Hey! [begins to wail and moan]
1754,12,8,Steven Spielberg,"There you go, Lucas! Dick him! [Indy struggles to get away, but Lucas is in full control] He's gonna do it right there! All right! All right Georgie!"
1755,12,8,George Lucas,"Grab his hands, heh. [Spielberg runs up and holds Indy's hands down on the pinball machine]"
1756,12,8,DA,"Hey leave him alone! [Lucas now pulls down his pants and sticks his dick in Indy's ass, firmly covering Indy's mouth with his right hand to muffle the screams.]"
1757,12,8,Steven Spielberg,COME ON BIG GUY!
1758,12,8,Indy,"NOOO! [three men approach to see what's happening. Indy looks at them and they quickly leave. The pinball machine moves violently. A glass of beer resting on it falls and shatters. Lucas comes to climax and the strain on his face is clearly shown. The DA covers his eyes, and his recollection ends]"
1759,12,8,DA,Nooo... Nohoho... [pounds his desk. Moments later he opens his window as the boys leave the courthouse] Waaait! [the boys stop and look up] Wait I... want to help! [begins to cry. The boys down below begin to cry also.]
1760,12,8,Father,"Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America."
1761,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us! [police sirens are heard approaching] Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! [walks towards the front doors]"
1762,12,8,Police Captain and Officers,"You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you."
1763,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[walks outside] No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu- [notices something different. The camera shows that one of the police officers is Chinese] AAH! [runs back inside and back to Butters] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!"
1764,12,8,Butters Stotch,Uhwhat?
1765,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[quite agitated] One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters! [heads to a window with Butters in tow, and opens it] Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!"
1766,12,8,Chinese Officer,The President?
1767,12,8,Police Captain and Officers,"All right men, come on. We're going in."
1768,12,8,Eric Cartman,"No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! [Butters shuts his eyes and shoots. The Chinese officer is struck in the groin and it explodes all over his clothes]"
1769,12,8,Chinese Officer,"[puts his hands over his crotch] Ow! Ah, o-ow! [Cartman looks on in disbelief]"
1770,12,8,Eric Cartman,Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
1771,12,8,Butters Stotch,What? What happened? [looks outside the window]
1772,12,8,Eric Cartman,"God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!"
1773,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Aw, I did it again?"
1774,12,8,Eric Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool! [looks away for a few moments, but...] You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!"
1775,12,8,Butters Stotch,"[finally speaks up] Well okay, I'm sorry!"
1776,12,8,Eric Cartman,...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick! [walks away] God damn it!
1777,12,8,DA,"It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you."
1778,12,8,Det Yates,Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
1779,12,8,Stan Marsh,But they raped Indiana Jones!
1780,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel."
1781,12,8,Det Yates,I didn't see it. [the boys stay silent]
1782,12,8,Jimmy Valmer,...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
1783,12,8,Det Yates,"No! I don't think anybody here saw it. Did you, Mitch? [Mitch is at the window looking outside through the glass] Mitch? Mitch? [close-up on Mitch, who begins to remember... Indiana is walking through some Southern woods when he encounters two men, one with a rifle, one with a knife.]"
1784,12,8,Steven Spielberg,"[holding the knife] Well well, Indiana Jones. What you doin' in our neck of the woods? [menacing] Now let's see you just drop them pants!"
1785,12,8,Indy,Drop?
1786,12,8,Steven Spielberg,Just take 'em right off.
1787,12,8,Indy,Uh what do you guys want?
1788,12,8,George Lucas,"Don't say anything, just do it. And pull off that little ol' biddy. The shirt there, too. [Indy takes off his clothes]"
1789,12,8,Steven Spielberg,"Them panties. Take 'em off. [Indy reluctantly removes his briefs. Spielberg turns and throws his knife into a nearby tree and goes after Indy. Indy turns and runs, but Spielberg chases him down and tackles him.] There, boy! I bet you can squeal! I bet you can squeal like a pig! [twists Indy's left ear lobe] Come on, squeal. Squeal now. Squ-squeal! [Indy tries each time, but can't do it] Weeee! Squeal."
1790,12,8,Indy,We-eee!
1791,12,8,Steven Spielberg,Squeal louder. Weeee!
1792,12,8,Indy,[at the same time] Weee!
1793,12,8,Steven Spielberg,Louder louder! Weeee!
1794,12,8,Indy,[at the same time] Weee!
1795,12,8,Steven Spielberg,Louder! Get down there boy! [has Indy on his knees and mounts him. Lucas cackles softly] Get them britches down.
1796,12,8,Indy,No...
1797,12,8,Steven Spielberg,"Yes, sir! Come on, squeal! Weeeeee!"
1798,12,8,Indy,[squeezes his eyes shut] Weee!
1799,12,8,Steven Spielberg,Weeeeee! [Lucas grunts excitedly] Weeee!
1800,12,8,Indy,Hawwww! Hawwww! [Murphy's recollection end and he's crying. Kyle walks up to him and consoles him]
1801,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. [Murphy begins to bawl and that sends the boys to crying]
1802,12,8,Eric Cartman,"No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I [POP. Cartman looks around, then drops the phone and runs to the source of the pop. Butters has fired the gun again. Cartman runs up to him] What happened?!"
1803,12,8,Butters Stotch,They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
1804,12,8,Eric Cartman,Good! Did you kill him? [grins in hope]
1805,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh, not exactly."
1806,12,8,SWAT Officer,"[his hands over his bloodied crotch] Ow. Oh, it stings. Ohhhh. [Cartman's eyelids drop halfway and he looks at Butters. Butters looks back and Cartman glances away]"
1807,12,8,Butters Stotch,"Well it's not where I aimed, honest."
1808,12,8,Eric Cartman,Dude...
1809,12,8,Butters Stotch,I seriously didn't mean it.
1810,12,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude! [Butters looks to his right and down] You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. [walks off]"
1811,12,8,Butters Stotch,"What? Uh where are you going, Eric?"
1812,12,8,Eric Cartman,"[near the front doors, turns around and jabs a finger at Butters] You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man."
1813,12,8,Butters Stotch,"By, by my, by myself?"
1814,12,8,Eric Cartman,I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass. [walks out of the restaurant in defeat towards the waiting officers] That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
1815,12,8,Police Captain and Officers,Go inside! Move! [the officers rush the restaurant]
1816,12,8,Deputy 1,"George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! We have a warrant for your arrest! [there's no response. He looks at another deputy] Break it in! [the second deputy kicks the doors in and leads the other deputies inside. They search the mansion until they reach the library, where they enter and suddenly stop. They all gasp.]"
1817,12,8,Deputy 2,My God. [Lucas is raping a man dressed as a Stormtrooper]
1818,12,8,Steven Spielberg,"Heey, what, what the hell are you doin' here?! [Lucas stops. Moments later, Spielberg and Lucas are led out of the mansion.] You've got nothin' on us! Seven hundred million box office!"
1819,12,8,George Lucas,Hm this is bullshit!
1820,12,8,Stormtrooper,[runs away like a chicken] Weeee! Weeee!
1821,12,8,Det Yates,"Boys, we got 'em."
1822,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1823,12,8,Det Yates,"[puts his hands on his hips] Spielberg and Lucas, they were... raping a Stormtrooper when the police broke in."
1824,12,8,Detective Yates and Mitch,And they found the dead raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round in their closet. [crosses his arms] They'll never be free to do this again. [the boys gather around the officers]
1825,12,8,Stan Marsh,"So, what now?"
1826,12,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?"
1827,12,8,Clyde Donovan,What do we do?
1828,12,8,Kyle Broflovski,We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
1829,12,8,Police Captain and Officers,Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.
1830,12,8,Father,There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!
1831,12,8,Police Captain and Officers,We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-
1832,12,8,Officer 1,"Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em."
1833,12,8,Police Captain and Officers,Got who?
1834,12,8,Officer 1,"Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir. [the captain lowers his gone and suddenly hugs the officer gratefully]"
1835,12,8,Police Captain and Officers,"[softly] Hohhh, they got them."
1836,12,8,Officer 2,They got 'em. It's over.
1837,12,8,Officer 3,It's over. [they hug each other]
1838,12,8,Father,That means... they'll never be free to rape again.
1839,12,8,Waiter,"It's over its over. [everyone weeps in relief and cry out ""They got 'em."" Most of them hug each other]"
1840,12,8,Officer 4,I love you.
1841,12,8,Officer 5,"I love you too. [Cartman, with a cock of his head to the right, motions to Butters to move, and they walk away. As they walk, Cartman begins discarding his costume]"
1842,12,8,Butters Stotch,So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
1843,12,8,Eric Cartman,"I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters. [turns aside] You think about it. [turns and walks away.]"
1844,12,8,Butters Stotch,[just stands there for a while] ...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. [walks off in a different direction]
1845,12,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats. [the kids take their seats as Mr. Garrison approaches his desk and puts the books away] Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? [Clyde, Kyle, and Bradley take their seats and Wendy walks up to the front of the class. She turns to face the class and looks over at Mr. Garrison]"
1846,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"[clears her throat] Thank you Mr. Garrison. [reads from her notes] Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer. [Cartman tries to contain his laughter, but it comes out anyway. Wendy is mad, but resumes her report.] An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- [Cartman again tries to contain his laughter]"
1847,12,9,Eric Cartman,She said it again. [laughs]
1848,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
1849,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[enjoying his distraction] Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?"
1850,12,9,Mr Garrison,"[lowers his head and rubs his right temple] Eric, for the love of Jesus..."
1851,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!"
1852,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Me? You're the one talking about killer titties. [Clyde contains a giggle] Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people. [holds his hands out as if grabbing at people] Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!"
1853,12,9,Butters Stotch,I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
1854,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
1855,12,9,Mr Garrison,"[flatly] Eric, stop being offensive."
1856,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison."
1857,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[irritated] No you aren't!
1858,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone. [the other boys laugh. He joins them] Dude, I'm on fire today!"
1859,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose. [points to the ceiling] Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof. [Wendy turns and glares at him. Cartman talks into an imaginary walkie talkie] ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" [Wendy suddenly gets in Cartman's face]"
1860,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
1861,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Not at all. [cups his hands again as if they're killer titties] ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"""
1862,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[points to him] You'd better shut up [lowers her right arm] or I'll make you shut up!
1863,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?"
1864,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
1865,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?"
1866,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!"
1867,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[begins to act like a gangbanger] You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down."
1868,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You think you're tough?
1869,12,9,Eric Cartman,[takes what looks like a gang pose] Whassup? [takes another one] Whassup?
1870,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I'll smack the shit out of you!
1871,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Standing right here, let's go, bitch."
1872,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
1873,12,9,Eric Cartman,You're gonna fight me after school?
1874,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,That's right!
1875,12,9,Eric Cartman,"You're a chick, dude."
1876,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there."
1877,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[poses again] Oh, it's on, bitch!"
1878,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You're gonna [jabs at the floor for emphasis] fucking die! [turns and walks away. Cartman strikes a few more poses]
1879,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody! [goes forth to spread the news. He walks by Stan, Kyle, and Bebe] Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!"
1880,12,9,Stan Marsh,What?
1881,12,9,Bebe Stevens,Wow. [goes forth to spread the news among the girls. She walks into the girls' bathroom and announces] Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
1882,12,9,Girls from various grades,[separately] Really? Wow.
1883,12,9,Ike Broflovski,[faltering a bit] Wendy and Cartman are fighting after school. [the other kindergartners jump for joy]
1884,12,9,Kindergartners,Yaaay!
1885,12,9,Red,"[opens the door and says] Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. [goes back inside and closes the door]"
1886,12,9,Pete,[flips his hair out of his eyes] Did she just call us emos?
1887,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school."
1888,12,9,Token Black,She is pissed off.
1889,12,9,Eric Cartman,"She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it."
1890,12,9,Clyde Donovan,"[taps Cartman twice on the right arm] Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down. [Cartman leans to the right a bit to get a better view. Craig, Token, and Jimmy look back at the table behind them. Wendy stares back. There are six other girls at her table: Bebe to her right, Lola and Heidi to her left, Esther opposite Bebe, Anne opposite Lola, and Millie opposite Heidi. There's no one seated opposite Wendy, so she has a clear view. Bebe leans over and whispers something to her. Cartman smiles, but the smile turns into worry] She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything."
1891,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. [Cartman looks at Wendy again, and Wendy stares back. She makes a fist with her right hand and punches the open palm of her left hand.]"
1892,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
1893,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, heh. [grabs his milk carton] If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. [takes a sip of milk through a straw and sets the carton down. Cartman begins to panic, looks around, and looks again at Wendy. Her face becomes the only thing he sees]"
1894,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?"
1895,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What?!
1896,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[almost whispering] Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-"
1897,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What?
1898,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes her aside and whispers] I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry."
1899,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!"
1900,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes her aside further and whispers] Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness."
1901,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!"
1902,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[seeing the unwanted attention] Pfft, apologize?! [begins to strike poses] That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh."
1903,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
1904,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me."
1905,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
1906,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[trying to put up a front] Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo. [Wendy goes back to her locker, the other kids go their separate ways. Wendy shuts her locker door and Cartman races up to her again. He whispers] Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight."
1907,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Get away from me! [walks away]
1908,12,9,Michael,"So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend."
1909,12,9,Stan Marsh,I guess so.
1910,12,9,Pete,"And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? [flips his hair]"
1911,12,9,Michael,"Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends."
1912,12,9,Stan Marsh,What am I supposed to do about it? [Craig and Jimmy walk up to him]
1913,12,9,Craig Tucker,"Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off."
1914,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,I'll bet she is!
1915,12,9,Butters Stotch,[walks into view] Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! [performs some punching moves]
1916,12,9,Eric Cartman,[peers out from the doorway] Wendy. Wendy psst.
1917,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What?!
1918,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick. [Wendy goes into the room Cartman was hiding in, which is a storage room. Once inside, she looks around, taking it all in.] Wendy, you're not gonna believe this. [She turns and glares at him] I just found out my mom has breast cancer. [she glares harder] Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs."
1919,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You really think that's gonna work on me?!
1920,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Wendy, [pulls out a letter-sized envelope] I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-"
1921,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You can't bribe your way out of this!
1922,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[puts his left hand up to hold her back] Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy."
1923,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,No you don't.
1924,12,9,Eric Cartman,[thinks for a moment] My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
1925,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"You don't get it, asshole! [shoves him back a bit] There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!"
1926,12,9,Eric Cartman,Eat my underwear?
1927,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,That's right.
1928,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[walks a few steps away] Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now."
1929,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!"
1930,12,9,Eric Cartman,"No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will."
1931,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You fucking suck so hard!!
1932,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I'll eat my underwear, Wendy. [unzips his pants.] And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us."
1933,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What are you doing?! [Cartman takes off his underwear]
1934,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm committed to peace, Wendy. [begins to swallow his underwear] I want you to see just how humbled I am... [gags]"
1935,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Ew! [looks away]
1936,12,9,Eric Cartman,[rather muffled] Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy. [tries one last swallow and succeeds] There. Yeahm.
1937,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Oh my God!
1938,12,9,Eric Cartman,So... [turns to face her] are we cool?
1939,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,No!
1940,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I ate my underwear! [advances. Wendy backs up] What the hell do you want from me?! [advances again. Wendy backs up, then runs around Cartman towards the door. He can't turn fast enough to match her] Weh-"
1941,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[opens the door] You are so pathetic!
1942,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[throws himself at her mercy] Wendy it isn't fair! [she runs out of there quickly] I ate my underwear for you! Nooo! [Craig walks by and stops to look in] Yo, what's up dawg?"
1943,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk."
1944,12,9,Stan Marsh,What?
1945,12,9,Eric Cartman,"You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours."
1946,12,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
1947,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch."
1948,12,9,Stan Marsh,"I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. [moves towards the stalls, but Cartman runs up ahead of him and stops him]"
1949,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken."
1950,12,9,Stan Marsh,Really?
1951,12,9,Eric Cartman,"You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way- [his gag reflex kicks in and his underwear come back up his throat and out his mouth. Stan looks on a bit stunned as Cartman pulls his underwear the rest of the way out, then glances back and forth at his underwear and at Stan] Oh, that's where I put those. [puts his underwear into a back pocket] Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you."
1952,12,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, there's nothing I can do about it."
1953,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[runs to Stan's left, by the sinks] God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! [his underwear is hanging from his right hand. Cartman notices, then runs out of the bathroom. Stan looks down helplessly]"
1954,12,9,Mr Garrison,"And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle. [Cartman glances at the clock on the wall: 2:58 p.m. His fingers drum the desk softly as he looks ahead blankly remembering Wendy's words: ""I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone!"" Then Butters': ""If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot.""] All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... [Cartman begins to block everything out except Wendy and the wall clock: 2:58 p.m. Wendy's ready to fight.]"
1955,12,9,Bebe Stevens,"Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!"
1956,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,"As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. [As the wall clock draws towards 3 p.m. Cartman thinks ""There's no way out. She's gonna kick my ass in front of everyone.""]"
1957,12,9,Butters Stotch,Almost time. [smiles]
1958,12,9,Mr Garrison,And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
1959,12,9,Clyde Donovan,"I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school."
1960,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[a revelation] Detention! That's it! [begins to fidget: ""I've gotta get detention, fast!"" The minute hand hits 0 and Cartman runs out of his seat towards the front of the class. He gets on Mr. Garrison's desk, shoves the Homework Assignments holder off the desk, lowers his pants, and leaves a nice brown gift on the desk. Mr. Garrison looks at him. The class is stunned as Cartman looks back at Mr. Garrison]"
1961,12,9,Mr Garrison,"Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?"
1962,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[strikes some gang poses] Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? [Wendy's especially shocked. No one says a word until...]"
1963,12,9,Butters Stotch,[cocks his head to his right] Huh.
1964,12,9,Mr Mackey,"Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. [walks away]"
1965,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[puts his feet up on the table and his hands behind his head, certain he's gotten out of the fight with Wendy] Ahhh, sweet."
1966,12,9,Butters Stotch,"[a door opens and his voice is heard] Eric. Hey Eric. [the camera shows Butters motioning Cartman over. Craig and Jimmy are behind him. Cartman looks over at them, then leaves his seat and walks to the door] Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy."
1967,12,9,Eric Cartman,What?! That's ridiculous!
1968,12,9,Butters Stotch,"But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight."
1969,12,9,Eric Cartman,That's not why I did it.
1970,12,9,Craig Tucker,Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
1971,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[begins to pose] Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that."
1972,12,9,Butters Stotch,"That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"""
1973,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude."
1974,12,9,Craig Tucker,"Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow."
1975,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
1976,12,9,Eric Cartman,[shocked] Huh?
1977,12,9,Butters Stotch,That way it won't matter if you get detention.
1978,12,9,Mr Mackey,"[finds him] Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!"
1979,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! [they walk away and the doors close. Cartman stands there for a moment, then returns to his seat. There's a rapping at the window and Cartman looks over]"
1980,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[outside] Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! [walks away. Cartman is truly scared]
1981,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,Wendy?
1982,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah?
1983,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"We need to talk to you, right now. [Wendy leaves her chair and her room, and goes downstairs. Her parents are waiting for her, quite displeased] Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school?"
1984,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What? No!
1985,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us? [Wendy looks and sees Cartman and Liane seated on the sofa. Cartman is sobbing quietly]"
1986,12,9,Mr Testaburger,Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?!
1987,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You don't understand. He said horrible things.
1988,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[whining] The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him]"
1989,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?"
1990,12,9,Eric Cartman,"The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him again]"
1991,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him!"
1992,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Mom, you don't-"
1993,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"Now, young lady."
1994,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I'm not going to hurt you.
1995,12,9,Mr Testaburger,"If there is any word of you fighting at school it's over for you, missy! Do you understand?!"
1996,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yes sir.
1997,12,9,Mr Testaburger,"We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman."
1998,12,9,Liane Cartman,"Oh no, thank you so much for your time. [Cartman looks at Wendy, then makes faces at her and sticks both middle fingers up at her. Wendy gets pissed off, but can't do anything now]"
1999,12,9,Mr Testaburger,It won't happen again.
2000,12,9,Liane Cartman,"You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. [stops making faces and looks up at her, then joins her as she walks to the front door]"
2001,12,9,Eric Cartman,Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
2002,12,9,Butters Stotch,Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
2003,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up."
2004,12,9,Bebe Stevens,Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
2005,12,9,An Older Girl,Here she comes! [everyone looks to their right and see Wendy approaching.]
2006,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[begins to strike poses as Wendy walks by] What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight."
2007,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[stops and looks at him] You know I can't fight you!
2008,12,9,Eric Cartman,Why not? You chicken? [begins to strut and cluck like a chicken]
2009,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
2010,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!"
2011,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!"
2012,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo."
2013,12,9,Bebe Stevens,"Come on Wendy, kick his ass!"
2014,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I can't! [the school bell rings and she walks towards the building] God damn it!
2015,12,9,Butters Stotch,She chickened out!
2016,12,9,Other students,Aw man. [they follow her into the building and towards class]
2017,12,9,Eric Cartman,Told you guys.
2018,12,9,Stan Marsh,"Ugh, I'm glad that's over with."
2019,12,9,Pete,"[walking by with the other Goths] Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad."
2020,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
2021,12,9,Clyde Donovan,"And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. [the class applauds politely as he takes his seat. Wendy has her face buried in her arms]"
2022,12,9,Mr Garrison,"Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go? [Cartman smiles and silently raises his hand] Okay Eric. [Cartman happily gets out of his seat and goes to face the class]"
2023,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[clears his throat] Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness. [Wendy lifts her head up in surprise] I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest. [stifles a laugh] We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. [stifles a laugh again]"
2024,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[softly] You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
2025,12,9,Eric Cartman,What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
2026,12,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay Eric, that's enough you smartass!"
2027,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Why?! [leaves her seat and walks up to Cartman] Why are you doing this to me?! [grabs him by the collar and shakes him] Why won't you just stop?!
2028,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[cautioning] Wendy, Wendy."
2029,12,9,Principal Victoria,[through the school's PA system] Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
2030,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,God! [Cartman cackles as she leaves]
2031,12,9,Principal Victoria,"Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman."
2032,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight."
2033,12,9,Principal Victoria,Oh no? Are you sure?
2034,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yes ma'am!
2035,12,9,Principal Victoria,I see. [gets up and walks to the window and looks out] I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
2036,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Ma'am?
2037,12,9,Principal Victoria,"I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed. [Faces Wendy] When there is a cancer, you have to ""fight"" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you."
2038,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[thinks a moment] My... parents said that if I fight-
2039,12,9,Principal Victoria,"And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you. [turns back to the window] You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will [turns back to Wendy] take everything. Do you understand?"
2040,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[the look of determination appears on her face and she makes her hands into fists] Yes ma'am!
2041,12,9,Principal Victoria,"When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!"
2042,12,9,Bebe Stevens,She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
2043,12,9,Millie Larsen,"What? [the other kids in the hall turn and everyone heads outside. Other classes hear about this and clear out, chattering all the while. Wendy leads the pack towards the playground. While still in the building she takes off her jacket and throws it aside. On her blouse is a purple prancing unicorn connected to some orange stars by a yellow rainbow]"
2044,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Go deep, Craig. [throws the football at Craig, who is off-screen] Not that deep, retard!"
2045,12,9,Butters Stotch,[runs up to Cartman smiling] She's coming! She's coming!
2046,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Butters, get out of here!"
2047,12,9,Butters Stotch,But Wendy's coming to fight you.
2048,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[in disbelief] ...Huh? [Butters turns left and looks at the building, smiling. Cartman looks to his right. The side doors fly open and Wendy walks down the steps spoiling for a fight. The students cheer her on as she turns left and heads for the playground. Some girls trail behind her, Bebe being the first among them.]"
2049,12,9,Clyde Donovan,Oh boy here we go!
2050,12,9,Butters Stotch,"All right! [other kids chatter around them. The Goth kids find some good spots along the brick wall. Red Goth and Kindergoth sit atop the wall, Tall Goth and Henrietta remain on the ground next to it]"
2051,12,9,Pete,It's about freaking time. [Wendy walks up to Cartman and they face off]
2052,12,9,Craig Tucker,"All right, let's DO IT!"
2053,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[wavering] What- what's up? [begins posing] What what's up? [draws close to her and cautions in a whisper] Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you."
2054,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I don't care! [Cartman looks around. Butters gleefully dances in place waiting for the fight to start]
2055,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time."
2056,12,9,A Girl,Shut up and fight! [everyone else joins in the demand. Wendy ties her hair up in a small bun behind her head]
2057,12,9,Eric Cartman,"All right, fine Wendy! [takes off his jacket] I'll fight ya you big bully!"
2058,12,9,The Goth Kids,Ohhhhh!
2059,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Fuck him up, Wendy!"
2060,12,9,Mr Mackey,[just arriving] Wendy?
2061,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[pants and looks back at Mr. Mackey] I'm finished! [gets up and walks away. The girls look at her with astonishment]
2062,12,9,Mr Mackey,"Eh somebod - somebody call the principal! [Cartman gets up, sniffling. Some of the kids begin to leave. Cartman looks around]"
2063,12,9,Eric Cartman,[demoralized] You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag. [begins to wail] My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. [wails some more]
2064,12,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we never thought you were cool."
2065,12,9,Eric Cartman,That's not true. You're just saying that.
2066,12,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, really. We've always thought you suck."
2067,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower."
2068,12,9,Eric Cartman,You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
2069,12,9,Craig Tucker,"No, it's true. We've always hated you."
2070,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Well, yeah."
2071,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. [the guys look at each other, sure that Cartman misunderstood them]"
2072,12,9,Craig Tucker,What?
2073,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[seeing a positive side to this somehow] If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief! [jumps up and clicks his feet up in the air] Oh, yay! [jumps up again]"
2074,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?"
2075,12,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)"
2076,12,10,Eric Cartman,Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
2077,12,10,Kenny McCormick,('Cause girls like shaved balls.)
2078,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,Girls like shaved balls?
2079,12,10,Kenny McCormick,(Yes they do.)
2080,12,10,Eric Cartman,What girl is gonna see your balls?
2081,12,10,Kenny McCormick,(Well I don't know.) [Something grabs Stan's attention and he stops and looks to his right.]
2082,12,10,Stan Marsh,"[pissed off] Oh Jesus, there's another one! [the other boys stop and look. A Peruvian pan flute band plays and draws a small crowd] Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? [the band has a bombo drummer, a siku player, and two charango players]"
2083,12,10,Eric Cartman,Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
2084,12,10,Stan Marsh,I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
2085,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,I think Kenny likes it. [Kenny's groovin' to the music]
2086,12,10,Stan Marsh,[turns left and leaves] I gotta get home for dinner.
2087,12,10,Eric Cartman,"[follows] Yeah, me too. [Kyle follows Cartman and Kenny keeps dancing.]"
2088,12,10,Stan Marsh,[pumping his fists] God!
2089,12,10,Eric Cartman,Shut up already!
2090,12,10,Stan Marsh,I'm outta here; see ya guys. [leaves. Kyle and Cartman follow and Kenny dances again]
2091,12,10,TV,"Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London! [the London skyline is shown. A British flag floats across the screen] London has something for everyone! Sights! [a pillar topped by a statue] Theater, and wonderful street performers! [the picture pans down to reveal a pan flute band playing to the crowd]"
2092,12,10,Stan Marsh,They're in London too?
2093,12,10,Sharon Marsh,"Hey, time for dinner guys. [Shelly turns off the TV and joins Stan to the dining room]"
2094,12,10,Sharon Marsh,"All right kids, dig in."
2095,12,10,Stan Marsh,Where's dad?
2096,12,10,Sharon Marsh,[irritated] He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
2097,12,10,Stan Marsh,Why?
2098,12,10,Sharon Marsh,Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
2099,12,10,Randy Marsh,"[arrives and starts shooting] All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. [moves around to Stan's side of the table, shooting video all the while]"
2100,12,10,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner."
2101,12,10,Randy Marsh,[points the camera at Shelly] There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
2102,12,10,Shelly Marsh,"Turn it off, Dad!"
2103,12,10,Randy Marsh,"[swoops around to Shelly's side to get a better shot] Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. [takes a quick look at the screen attached to the camera, to adjust the aim. A second later and pan flute music is heard. Stan looks around and locates the source. He walks to a front window and sees a pan flute band playing across the street. In front of them is a briefcase full of CDs]"
2104,12,10,Stan Marsh,Oh Jesus Christ! [Randy walks up behind him with the camera]
2105,12,10,Randy Marsh,"Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. [Stan just glances at him]"
2106,12,10,Eric Cartman,"I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces... [moves Kyle's piece back seven spaces and softly says] ...screw you Kyle. [normal voice] Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. [tosses the dice to him]"
2107,12,10,Stan Marsh,"You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night."
2108,12,10,Eric Cartman,So?
2109,12,10,Stan Marsh,"So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?"
2110,12,10,Eric Cartman,How much?
2111,12,10,Stan Marsh,Over two hundred bucks.
2112,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,Two hundred dollars?
2113,12,10,Eric Cartman,Really? Are you sure?
2114,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! [the other boys stay quiet]"
2115,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,...Become a Peruvian flute band?
2116,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer."
2117,12,10,Eric Cartman,[stands up] Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
2118,12,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
2119,12,10,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
2120,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? [the boys give it some thought]
2121,12,10,Eric Cartman,"Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?"
2122,12,10,Craig Tucker,...Fine.
2123,12,10,Eric Cartman,"Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?"
2124,12,10,Craig Tucker,...Yeah.
2125,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? [Craig stays quiet, so Cartman prevails upon him and enters his house]"
2126,12,10,Eric Cartman,"Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome."
2127,12,10,Craig Tucker,What do you guys want?
2128,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters with Stan and Kenny] Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!"
2129,12,10,Eric Cartman,[applauds] All right Craig! [pats him on the back]
2130,12,10,Craig Tucker,You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
2131,12,10,Stan Marsh,"There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs."
2132,12,10,Eric Cartman,"And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig."
2133,12,10,Craig Tucker,[assessing the situation] You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
2134,12,10,Eric Cartman,"Craig, don't be an asshole."
2135,12,10,Craig Tucker,[turns right and walks past Cartman] I'll go get the money. [the boys grin. Stan and Kenny high-five each other.]
2136,12,10,Stan Marsh,"All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!"
2137,12,10,Eric Cartman,"And a one, and a two, and a- [the boys launch into their rendition of ""Mary Had A Little Lamb""]"
2138,12,10,Man 1,"Wow, that's such cultural music."
2139,12,10,Man 2,"Very cultural, yes."
2140,12,10,Eric Cartman,"[as the men leave] Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. [in their briefcase are $10 CDs from their band, the Llama Brothers, ""Tapas and Moonscapes"". Man 1 whips out a fresh $10 bill and buys a CD]"
2141,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,Gracias.
2142,12,10,Woman 1,[walks by and stops to check out the CDs] How cultural. [buys one for herself]
2143,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,This is awesome!
2144,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Ya see, Craig? [another band starts up nearby and Stan steps forward for a better look. The boys look to their right]"
2145,12,10,Eric Cartman,Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! [leads the other boys to the competing band]
2146,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. [the other band ignores them and continues playing]"
2147,12,10,Eric Cartman,No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
2148,12,10,Stan Marsh,"This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! [the other band looks at them for a few seconds, then resumes its music, its members grinning.]"
2149,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,God damn it!
2150,12,10,Eric Cartman,No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku]
2151,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Come on, guys. [the boys return to their spot and start playing again, but another band begins to play off to their left]"
2152,12,10,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
2153,12,10,Eric Cartman,"No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!"
2154,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands. [the audience members begin to talk amongst themselves. Chertoff activates the screen behind him, and a world map appears onscreen.] The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General?"
2155,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,"[walks into view before the screen] France, Japan, and the northeastern United States are currently the hardest hit. Make no mistake: [sticks an index finger up] this is a pan flute epidemic."
2156,12,10,Senator 1,A pan-demic?
2157,12,10,Michael Chertoff,Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.
2158,12,10,Senator 2,"Excuse me, but... aid other countries?"
2159,12,10,Michael Chertoff,Senator?
2160,12,10,Senator 2,With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves!
2161,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"[starting soft and with rising voice, he leaves the podium and faces the senator] You heartless bastard! This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity! And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands! Is that clear?! [the senator collapses back into his seat and begins to cry and Chertoff returns to the podium] As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained."
2162,12,10,Paratrooper,"Go, go! [all kinds of law enforcement and military vehicles rush in and surround the mall. Hazmat officers pour out of a Hazmat truck. Inside, the boys now play ""Three Blind Mice"". A woman stops by and buys a CD. The boys hear some commotion and look over: military troops surround the second band and subdue it]"
2163,12,10,Eric Cartman,"Ha! [sticks his right middle finger up] Serves you right, assholes! [behind them the third band is subdued]"
2164,12,10,Soldier 1,One more over here! [the boys are surrounded and subdued]
2165,12,10,Soldier 2,Let's go! Get 'em out!
2166,12,10,Soldier 3,"Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go!"
2167,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, back off!"
2168,12,10,Soldier 3,"Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained! [Hazmat officers collect the CDs slowly, gingerly]"
2169,12,10,Randy Marsh,"There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly. [neither female responds to him] What are you watching, guys?"
2170,12,10,Sharon Marsh,[irritated] The news.
2171,12,10,Randy Marsh,[draws even closer to her] Huh?
2172,12,10,Sharon Marsh,[irritated] We're watching the news.
2173,12,10,Randy Marsh,"[turns the camera towards the TV] That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now. [moves around to Shelly's side] What do you think about the television, Shelly? [Shelly remains quiet as Randy glances at the TV] Oh, the news is starting! [starts taking video of that]"
2174,12,10,Anchorman Tom,"The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day. [Times Square in New York is shown, with more bands being arrested] In cities all over the world [a shot of St. Louis] flute bands have been removed and quarantined. [a shot of Seattle] But more may still be out there. Homeland Security's requesting that [a graphic appears that says pretty much the following] if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it. Mark down the flute band's location, and do not, under any circumstances, buy their CDs. [the reporter reappears onscreen] The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami."
2175,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Eh-excuse us. Hello? [spots a soldier in one of the watchtowers] Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?"
2176,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?"
2177,12,10,Guard,Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!
2178,12,10,Stan Marsh,"No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-"
2179,12,10,Guard,"I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!"
2180,12,10,A Musician,[walks into view] Señor? Comprar CD la musica? [the soldier kills him with a few blasts from his automatic rifle]
2181,12,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)"
2182,12,10,Craig Tucker,"""Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole."" [some alarms go off for a few seconds, then fall silent as Chertoff appears above the crowd with a blond translator to his left]"
2183,12,10,Michael Chertoff,Attention Peruvian flute bands:
2184,12,10,"Thompson, the Translator",Atencione bandas de flauta Perú.
2185,12,10,Michael Chertoff,We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
2186,12,10,"Thompson, the Translator",Cooperacion y peciencia es apreciado.
2187,12,10,Michael Chertoff,Tomorrow you will be boarding ships...
2188,12,10,"Thompson, the Translator",Mañana sera el embarque de barcos...
2189,12,10,Michael Chertoff,...which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
2190,12,10,"Thompson, the Translator",...que la lleva a viajar Guantanimo.
2191,12,10,Michael Chertoff,There you will spend the rest of your lives.
2192,12,10,"Thompson, the Translator",Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas. Gracias! [they turn and head inside. The Peruvian flute bands break up behind the boys and head back to their business]
2193,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
2194,12,10,Stan Marsh,Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
2195,12,10,Sharon Marsh,"Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?"
2196,12,10,Mrs Tucker,"No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried."
2197,12,10,Mr Tucker,You've checked with the police?
2198,12,10,Gerald Broflovski,Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
2199,12,10,Sharon Marsh,"None of the other kids have seen them since a- [notice Randy taping them] Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!"
2200,12,10,Randy Marsh,"Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon."
2201,12,10,Sharon Marsh,Well then stop being an idiot and help!
2202,12,10,Mr Tucker,Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything?
2203,12,10,Gerald Broflovski,All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
2204,12,10,Sheila Broflovski,That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
2205,12,10,Mrs Tucker,What is that supposed to mean?
2206,12,10,Sharon Marsh,"To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys."
2207,12,10,Mrs Tucker,[quiet for a few seconds] Now wait just a minute!
2208,12,10,Sharon Marsh,I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
2209,12,10,Mr Tucker,Like every kid doesn't have some problems!
2210,12,10,Sheila Broflovski,Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
2211,12,10,Mrs Tucker,Oh my God!
2212,12,10,Mr Tucker,This is ridiculous!
2213,12,10,Randy Marsh,[filming the argument] Ohhh this is good!
2214,12,10,Gerald Broflovski,That's not ridicul-
2215,12,10,Soldier 4,"Sir, good news! Looks like we did it. Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all! [other soldiers cry out ""All right! We did it!""]"
2216,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!"
2217,12,10,Official 1,"We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out."
2218,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Well think about it, idiot! Where else would ""Peruvian"" flute bands come from? [everyone else mulls it over]"
2219,12,10,Official 1,Hmm...
2220,12,10,Michael Chertoff,The country is in the name!
2221,12,10,Official 2,"No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere."
2222,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here! [points to the country on a world map]"
2223,12,10,Official 3,Peh-roo.
2224,12,10,Michael Chertoff,Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!
2225,12,10,Official 1,"Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme."
2226,12,10,Soldier 2,Yeah.
2227,12,10,Michael Chertoff,Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us [pounds his right fist onto his left palm] unless they are stopped at the source!
2228,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,"Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape."
2229,12,10,Michael Chertoff,[grabs Official 2 by the front of the shirt] See? [lets go and leaves] God damn it! [they higher officials walk out behind him]
2230,12,10,Michael Chertoff,[holds the CD the boys were carrying] The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes.
2231,12,10,Stan Marsh,"This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band."
2232,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band."
2233,12,10,Stan Marsh,"We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money."
2234,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,We just wanna go home.
2235,12,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)"
2236,12,10,Michael Chertoff,Which tourist location were they playing at?
2237,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,An outdoor mall in Colorado.
2238,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States."
2239,12,10,Stan Marsh,We we speak English!
2240,12,10,Eric Cartman,And we're White.
2241,12,10,Michael Chertoff,Let me talk to you guys out here. [takes his chief aide and the two other officials into the observation room and closes the door.] Well what do you think?
2242,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,"I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us."
2243,12,10,Michael Chertoff,I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.
2244,12,10,Official 1,A hybrid? Ah how is that possible?
2245,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?
2246,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had. [walks to the one-way window]"
2247,12,10,Official 1,Sir?
2248,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"If they are the hybrid we're talking about, [puts his left arm up high against the window and presses his head against that] then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all."
2249,12,10,Craig Tucker,"Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you? [the other boys look at each other] Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys."
2250,12,10,Eric Cartman,"You're being extremely negative, Craig. [Chertoff and the others return]"
2251,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"[approaches the boys] All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home."
2252,12,10,Stan Marsh,Help you how?
2253,12,10,Michael Chertoff,[walks around the table and the boys] You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.
2254,12,10,Craig Tucker,"Can we please just go home, sir?"
2255,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"[drops the CD onto the table] We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning."
2256,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! [almost falls apart, but Stan grabs him and holds him in place]"
2257,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, calm down."
2258,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You know I can't go there, Stan!"
2259,12,10,Stan Marsh,One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. [the officials look at each other]
2260,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands."
2261,12,10,Soldier 3,"Thompson, can you come over here? [the translator from earlier walks up to him] The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them."
2262,12,10,Musician 2,¡Por favor! ¡No podemos ir! ¡Estamos aquí para proteger a ustedes!
2263,12,10,Musician 3,Sí.
2264,12,10,Other Musicians,"Sí. No podemos ir. Si, protectores."
2265,12,10,Thompson,"They're saying something like, ""You can't send us away. We are the protectors."""
2266,12,10,Soldier 3,Protectors from what?
2267,12,10,Musician 2,¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda!
2268,12,10,Soldier 3,What does that mean?
2269,12,10,Thompson,"I think he said, ""the furry death""?"
2270,12,10,Musician 2,La muerte peluda. ¡La muerte peluda!
2271,12,10,Announcer,[gruffly] This is CNN.
2272,12,10,Anchorman Tom,"The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect."
2273,12,10,Reporter Paul Harris,"Really welcome silence, Tom. There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace. The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the- [a low moan is heard and a heavy footfall shakes the ground. The camera looks around for the source of the shaking] What the?! [an explosion has the camera focus on the resulting burst of fire]"
2274,12,10,Woman 2,[voice only] Oh my Gohhhd!
2275,12,10,Woman 3,[voice only] Ohmigod! [a police car flies through the air from the direction of the blast.]
2276,12,10,Reporter Paul Harris,Jesus Christ! [the police car lands between him and the water fountain upside down. Harris ducks down]
2277,12,10,Shopper,AAAAHHH!! [Harris gets up again and looks at the damage]
2278,12,10,Reporter Paul Harris,"There's, there's something else here, it's... [the camera switches to the police car again] It's not a Peruvian flute band, it's a... Oh my God what is that thing?! [points to the sky, but the camera doesn't follow it]"
2279,12,10,Anchorman Tom,"Paul Paul, what do you see?"
2280,12,10,Reporter Paul Harris,"It's furry! It's very furry! [the transmission flickers, then fades out]"
2281,12,10,Anchorman Tom,"Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say ""furry""? [instantly another heavy footfall rattles the CNN newsroom and shorts out several monitors. Reporters and other worker scatter around] Okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh- [a second footfall shuts down the newsroom entirely and tilts the camera one way, but it's still airing. A third footfall tilts the camera in another direction and the roof is peeled back. A shaft of light strikes Tom's head as he looks up into the night] My God what is that thing?! [a fourth footfall tilts the camera down and in still another direction. Tom is lifted into the air...] AAAHHH!! [...and the camera finally stops transmitting, leaving behind an image of static, then nothing.]"
2282,12,10,Pilot,"All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics. [walks backwards into the cockpit and closes the door. The boys say nothing for a while]"
2283,12,10,Craig Tucker,"Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said ""Hey, you know? This plan might backfire."" [no answer] No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes."
2284,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
2285,12,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now."
2286,12,10,Craig Tucker,[testing] I'm being a dick?
2287,12,10,Stan Marsh,[firmly] Yes!
2288,12,10,Craig Tucker,"You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?"
2289,12,10,Eric Cartman,There's no talking to this guy.
2290,12,10,Stan Marsh,"All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?"
2291,12,10,Craig Tucker,That would be great. Thank you.
2292,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
2293,12,10,Kenny McCormick,(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
2294,12,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here."
2295,12,10,Sharon Marsh,"Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you. [*click* She notices that Randy videotaped the call] Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!"
2296,12,10,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday."
2297,12,10,Sharon Marsh,"[the scene continues with Randy's POV] I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! [a low moan is heard. She stops and looks around, getting more afraid with each moan]"
2298,12,10,Randy Marsh,What the hell was that? [a heavy footfall shorts out the house]
2299,12,10,Sharon Marsh,Oh my God.
2300,12,10,Randy Marsh,"Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! [turns around and runs out]"
2301,12,10,Shelly Marsh,"[coming down the stairs] What's going on, Dad? [Randy wheels around to see her]"
2302,12,10,Randy Marsh,"Get back to your room, Shelly! [turns around and goes to the front door. He opens it and sees people running all over the street in a panic, He then points his camera at some helicopters overhead]"
2303,12,10,Randy Marsh,What's going on?
2304,12,10,Mr Garrison,They're all over the place!
2305,12,10,Randy Marsh,What are?!
2306,12,10,Mr Garrison,"They're really furry! [runs off. Randy joins the others out on the street. He hears someone above him and points the camera to catch a man falling from the sky. A chunk of his body has been bitten off, exposing ribs on the right side]"
2307,12,10,Randy Marsh,What did that?! [moves his camera off the body and sees more people running. A giant guinea pig appears among the panicked residents] What is that thing?! [someone taps him from behind and he turns around to see who it is. Officer Barbrady appears on camera]
2308,12,10,Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! [a house blows up and Randy starts running, his camera aimed at his feet. He aims his camera forward again and sees people rounding the corner and running his way. Linda Stotch is one of them.]"
2309,12,10,Linda,AAAAAAAAH!! [Two heavy footfalls follow and a car flies through the air from left to right. Another giant guinea pig walks along the crossroad towards the mangled car]
2310,12,10,Randy Marsh,Oh my Gohhhd!
2311,12,10,Stephen Stotch,"[getting Randy's attention] Go go go go back the other way! [Randy runs back along the street, the camera again aimed at his feet. He stops and aims the camera at himself]"
2312,12,10,Randy Marsh,"[out of breath] Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God. [pants] Oh God. [pants] I'm [pants] I'm so [pants] Startled."
2313,12,10,A Woman,[voice only] Oh my Gohhhd! [Randy stops panting and looks to his left.]
2314,12,10,Randy Marsh,HAAA! [A growl is heard and all of a sudden his camera goes dark.]
2315,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,[entering] Sir? We've got a bigger problem.
2316,12,10,Michael Chertoff,[smiles knowingly] Oh? And what might that be?
2317,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be... [Chertoff turns around and smiles at him]
2318,12,10,Michael Chertoff,[hiding a folder behind his back] Guinea pigs?
2319,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,[softly] Yes sir. How did you know?
2320,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?"
2321,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,Sir?
2322,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together."
2323,12,10,Chief Aide Davis,You... You... knew this was going to happen.
2324,12,10,Michael Chertoff,"Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere. [his face becomes monstrous. His tongue shoots out and stabs Davis in the right eye. Davis goes into convulsions for a long time, but finally dies. Chertoff releases his tongue's grip and it goes back into his mouth] Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere. [he looks at the folder he had behind his back. Attached to it is a picture... of Craig]"
2325,12,11,Shelly Marsh,"What's going on, Dad? [cut to the fallen man with a chunk of flesh missing from his left side]"
2326,12,11,Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- [cut to the power going out at CNN, then to an explosion, then to people running away from something, then the giant guinea pigs appearing, then to Linda Stotch panicking and running, then to a second car flying across an intersection, then to Randy looking into his camera]"
2327,12,11,Randy Marsh,[out of breath] Oh God. [pants] I'm- [pants] I'm so- [pants] Startled. [the camera cuts out on him] ARRRGH!
2328,12,11,Craig Tucker,"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday. [a picture of him, his family, and a grandmother standing behind a cake. Ten candles are on the cake. Balloons are all around and a ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" banner is above them] My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars. [a picture of that is shown] I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house [a shot of the four boys in Craig's living room] and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band. [a shot of the newly-formed band, the Llama Brothers] They promised I would double my money in one afternoon. [soldiers swoop in and apprehend them] But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami. [the camp is shown, followed by the five boys sitting in the interrogation room] We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru. [a shot of a DHS cargo plane with the boys sitting on the ground near it.] And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. [he sits on one suitcase, Kenny on another. The whole group is in a mountainous region of Peru]"
2329,12,11,Stan Marsh,"We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!"
2330,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
2331,12,11,Cpt Taylor,I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.
2332,12,11,Cpt Gabriel,This is where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington?
2333,12,11,Cpt Taylor,I'm trying. [...and gets through]
2334,12,11,A Voice,This is Connor in Washington.
2335,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land."
2336,12,11,Carter,Jesus they're everywhere!
2337,12,11,Cpt Taylor,What are everywhere?
2338,12,11,Carter,...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh.
2339,12,11,Stan Marsh,Guinea pigs?
2340,12,11,Carter,Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared. [a few more groans and communication is cut]
2341,12,11,Randy Marsh,"I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again. [points it to himself] Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window... [aims it at the living room windows, through which you still see people running around in panic, then aims it at himself again] I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me, [moves the camera just enough to show Sharon] and there's Shelly. [Sharon is protecting her somewhat] Wave to the camera, Shelly."
2342,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do."
2343,12,11,Randy Marsh,I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
2344,12,11,Sharon Marsh,[stands up] We have to see what the news is saying. [walks over to the TV and turns it on. A shot of New York City appears.]
2345,12,11,Reporter,[off camera] This is a shot of New York City where the... giant guinea pigs have also attacked.
2346,12,11,Sharon Marsh,Guinea pigs?
2347,12,11,Reporter,Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.
2348,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, this thing is worldwide? [two giant guinea pigs suddenly come into view. The camera moves to a group of soldiers firing at a third guinea pig.]"
2349,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? [Randy focuses the camera on her. A loud thump is heard, knocking Randy off balance. He regains it and makes sure Sharon and Shelly are fine, then turns to the source of a growl: a giant guinea pig has broken through a wall and is now looking at the family]"
2350,12,11,Randy Marsh,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
2351,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"Go Randy, run! [Sharon takes Shelly out the front door. Randy follows them]"
2352,12,11,Randy Marsh,Gotta get out!
2353,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"Michaels, Harrison, anybody? [no response] Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge."
2354,12,11,Stan Marsh,"[steps forward] Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government."
2355,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"...Yes, that was the order."
2356,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,And that makes sense to you?
2357,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"Nope, not at all."
2358,12,11,Cpt Gabriel,"Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either."
2359,12,11,Stan Marsh,"None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!"
2360,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"You don't understand, the plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here. We don't have enough gas to fly anyplace."
2361,12,11,Craig Tucker,"Oh, that's awesome."
2362,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,So we've gotta find another way out of here.
2363,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"It's starting to look that way, yeah."
2364,12,11,Craig Tucker,This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
2365,12,11,Eric Cartman,"You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig."
2366,12,11,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
2367,12,11,Eric Cartman,Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
2368,12,11,Cpt Gabriel,"Luck at that: no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru. [the camera zooms out and at least eight giant burrowing holes appear before them.]"
2369,12,11,Top Official,"More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions. We checked on Wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the Andes Mountains, here. [points to the mountains]"
2370,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?
2371,12,11,Official 1,"...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands."
2372,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!
2373,12,11,Official 2,No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.
2374,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),That was an order! [pounds both fists into the map table.] The pan flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night! [pounds both fists into the map table again.] I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!
2375,12,11,Soldier 4,Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people. [turns around and walks out sobbing]
2376,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey we're down in... Main Street now and... [a tank rolls by] Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that. [the tank fires a cannon, but the giant guinea pig is unaffected by it.] Ohhh!"
2377,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"[whispering] Where do we go, Randy?"
2378,12,11,Randy Marsh,"We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. [points, and Sharon takes Shelly out the door and to the left. Randy follows them, but something catches his eye: a giant guinea pig is chewing a man's left arm off. The man is trying to get away by holding on to a light post with his right hand.]"
2379,12,11,Man,"Geow, my arm! MY ARM! [the guinea pig pulls him away from the light post and dangles him]"
2380,12,11,Randy Marsh,Oh Jesus!
2381,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, run! [the man falls to the ground as the rest of his arm is bitten off. Randy runs]"
2382,12,11,Randy Marsh,"[the camera is aimed at his feet again] Okay. We're running now. [aims the camera at Sharon and Shelly before him] There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!"
2383,12,11,Shelly Marsh,"[glances back] Dad! [Randy moves the camera around to catch another mauling, then aims it back at Sharon and Shelly. Before them is an empty bus with an open door]"
2384,12,11,Randy Marsh,"In there, in there! [Sharon and Shelly go on up the steps and into the bus. Randy follows them in] Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?"
2385,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, put down that c-! [something big crashes into the bus. Randy gets his bearings and he sees a giant guinea pig outside the bus looking in]"
2386,12,11,Shelly Marsh,It's gonna kill us!
2387,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"[soothing her down] Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. [another guinea pig jostles the bus]"
2388,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. [runs down the aisle and outside]"
2389,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy? Where are you going? [Randy stops a moment and then continues, moving away from the bus. He stops and aims his camera at the bus. Two giant guinea pigs climb up to the roof]"
2390,12,11,Randy Marsh,Here we see a view from outside the bus.
2391,12,11,Sharon Marsh,Randy! [Randy runs back into the bus and towards his girls] What the hell are you doing?
2392,12,11,Randy Marsh,"I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. [another jostle follows and the camera shuts off again]"
2393,12,11,Cpt Gabriel,"I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps."
2394,12,11,Cpt Taylor,This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit. [they pass by it] Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples?
2395,12,11,Cpt Gabriel,Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs.
2396,12,11,Cpt Taylor,Oh my God.
2397,12,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what is this place?"
2398,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge."
2399,12,11,Craig Tucker,"That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world."
2400,12,11,Stan Marsh,"[turns right and walks towards Craig] Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!"
2401,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Stuff just happens.
2402,12,11,Craig Tucker,Stuff just happens.
2403,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,That's right!
2404,12,11,Craig Tucker,You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
2405,12,11,Eric Cartman,That's right.
2406,12,11,Craig Tucker,You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.
2407,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving."
2408,12,11,Kenny McCormick,"[suddenly points] (Hey, look out!) [some brown saliva lands on Cpt. Gabriel's right shoulder, then he's chomped up, then Cpt. Taylor is chomped up too. One of Cpt. Gabriel's arms falls back to the ground]"
2409,12,11,Cpt Taylor,"Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!"
2410,12,11,Randy Marsh,"All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters."
2411,12,11,Butters Stotch,"Hello, heh."
2412,12,11,Linda Stotch,"What is that? Chris, what is that?"
2413,12,11,Randy Marsh,"That's a that's a, that's a new sound. [the sound of bees gets louder and louder as Randy moves his camera around]"
2414,12,11,Stephen Stotch,Oh God look!
2415,12,11,Sharon Marsh,Those aren't guinea pigs.
2416,12,11,Stephen Stotch,Get off the roof! [the group quickly heads for the stairs.]
2417,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Go! Go go go go go! [the group goes down the stairs and Randy closes the roof door behind him.] Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. [they reach Best Buy's main floor. As they go towards the entrance two televisions on the television aisle show a news report]"
2418,12,11,An Anchorman,And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.
2419,12,11,Randy Marsh,Oh no! Oho oho. [they exit the store]
2420,12,11,Townsman,"Get away, there's bees everywhere! [The group runs across the parking lot with everyone else] There's another one right there!  [Randy looks to his right with his camera and a giant guinea bee stands there not doing much. Another bee appears in front of him, and to his left, a man is on the ground with a giant stinger stuck into his chest.]"
2421,12,11,Townsman 2,"It stung me! It stung me! [Randy looks behind now, seeing the Best Buy store and a giant guinea bee]"
2422,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!"
2423,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
2424,12,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. [points to his left]"
2425,12,11,Kenny McCormick,(I think we're fucked!)
2426,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, hey, look at this. [points to his right. The other boys look. A small temple is shown with two statues, one on either side of the entrance. The boys approach it]"
2427,12,11,Eric Cartman,What is it?
2428,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know. It's old.
2429,12,11,Stan Marsh,Let's see what's in there.
2430,12,11,Craig Tucker,"""Let's see what's in there."" That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say ""Let's see what's in there."""
2431,12,11,Stan Marsh,"It might be a way out, Craig!"
2432,12,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! [the boys enter]"
2433,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries"
2434,12,11,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. Totally.)
2435,12,11,Stan Marsh,"You guys, look at this. [the others go to the wall Stan is looking at] It's a wall of ancient drawings. [first drawing is a group of four men playing instruments]"
2436,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band."
2437,12,11,Stan Marsh,"I know, a-and look. [second drawing is the flute band playing music, which is driving away two giant guinea pigs]"
2438,12,11,Eric Cartman,Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
2439,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no way! Look! [a flute band is shown behind bars] The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. [the boys look up and to the right]"
2440,12,11,Stan Marsh,And then the guinea pigs killing people. [they look a little lower] And then... [a boy holds a staff against a giant guinea pig]
2441,12,11,Eric Cartman,"Dude, it's Craig!"
2442,12,11,Craig Tucker,What?
2443,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,That is Craig. [Craig comes forward to look for himself. The other boys back away]
2444,12,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?"
2445,12,11,Craig Tucker,I have no idea.
2446,12,11,Eric Cartman,"Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?"
2447,12,11,Craig Tucker,I don't know.
2448,12,11,Top Official,There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.
2449,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),And how are the efforts to contain all this going?
2450,12,11,Official 3,"[steps forward] It's bad, sir. It seems we have no way of stopping it; we've lost complete control. [Chertoff laughs maniacally]"
2451,12,11,Top Official,"Uh, sir?"
2452,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke."
2453,12,11,Official 1,"Oh, a-hah."
2454,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu."
2455,12,11,Soldier,"Uh, Machu Picchu, sir?"
2456,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?!"
2457,12,11,Official 1,"But S-sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help the-"
2458,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),Am I in charge or not?! [silences them all]
2459,12,11,Randy Marsh,We're in the [pants] grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
2460,12,11,Sharon Marsh,Can we get out through the highway?
2461,12,11,Soldier 5,The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it.
2462,12,11,Mr Garrison,Guinea rats?
2463,12,11,Randy Marsh,[almost hyperventilating] I'm so startled.
2464,12,11,Mr Garrison,"What do you mean ""guinea rats""?"
2465,12,11,Soldier 5,"Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there."
2466,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, will you stop doing that?! [Randy continues to film her, then jumps to the next speaker, then the next one...]"
2467,12,11,Stephen Stotch,"Look, I I need we need to find a way out under the city."
2468,12,11,Mr Garrison,In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
2469,12,11,Randy Marsh,"[walks away with the camera, rather scared] Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?"
2470,12,11,A Woman,Oh my God!
2471,12,11,Townsman 3,Something's inside the store!
2472,12,11,Townsman 4,Guinea rabbits! They're inside! [facing him is a guinea pig in a blue rabbit outfit]
2473,12,11,Townsman 5,God they're everywhere!
2474,12,11,Townsman 6,Help me! [Randy finds out who's screaming for help] Help... me... [it's a man who's practically been bitten in half]
2475,12,11,Townswoman 1,Travis! No!
2476,12,11,Randy Marsh,You can't help him!
2477,12,11,Stephen Stotch,There's something over there!
2478,12,11,Townsman 7,It's a guinea bear!
2479,12,11,Randy Marsh,"No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! [he lowers the camera as he runs, then raises it again to focus on a woman]"
2480,12,11,Townswoman 2,Kill me!
2481,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! [he follows the survivors into the storeroom, and the door closes behind them a few seconds later. There is no light in the room]"
2482,12,11,Shelly Marsh,"Mom, I can't see."
2483,12,11,Randy Marsh,"It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision. [night vision mode is on] There. There. Okay. Gaaah! [the others gasp]"
2484,12,11,Sharon Marsh,What what what what?
2485,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! [camera out]"
2486,12,11,Stan Marsh,"Let's head over this way, guys."
2487,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,Hear that? It sounds like water.
2488,12,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it's coming from up there."
2489,12,11,Stan Marsh,Wow. [they find themselves in a massive complex full of statues whose mouths or noses serve as waterfall fountains. Several suspension bridges connect the mouth of the statue they're in to the other statues]
2490,12,11,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that's awesome."
2491,12,11,Stan Marsh,"All right, let's go. [Craig doesn't move]"
2492,12,11,Craig Tucker,No.
2493,12,11,Stan Marsh,"Wait, whattaya mean no?"
2494,12,11,Craig Tucker,I'm not following you guys any more.
2495,12,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we we have to go check this out."
2496,12,11,Craig Tucker,Why?
2497,12,11,Stan Marsh,"'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is."
2498,12,11,Craig Tucker,"Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because ""that's just the way it is."""
2499,12,11,Stan Marsh,"Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!"
2500,12,11,Craig Tucker,I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
2501,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,How do you do that?
2502,12,11,Craig Tucker,"It's easy. Watch. [turns around and walks back out the way they came in. He makes his way back to the temple's entrance, and the boys follow him]"
2503,12,11,Stan Marsh,"Craig, dude, wait up."
2504,12,11,Eric Cartman,"[Craig leads the boys across the Nazca Plateau] Dude, Craig, we should go back now."
2505,12,11,Craig Tucker,No.
2506,12,11,Stan Marsh,"[Craig leads them across an open field] Hey look, there's something here."
2507,12,11,Craig Tucker,...Nope.
2508,12,11,Eric Cartman,"[the boys walk through a thunderstorm] Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around."
2509,12,11,Craig Tucker,"Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it."
2510,12,11,Randy Marsh,"It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say ""hey"" guys."
2511,12,11,Shelly Marsh,What is that? What is that? [Sharon holds her close]
2512,12,11,Randy Marsh,"I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! [gets up with his camera and heads outside]"
2513,12,11,Randy Marsh,What is it?
2514,12,11,Husband,It's a Guineasaurus Rex! [Randy turns around and sees the G. Rex next to P.F. Chang. It's much bigger than other guinea creatures: about 30 feet high at the shoulder. Everyone near it scatters. Randy zooms in on the car it seems to be eating from and sees a dead couple there. The woman's body is halfway out the car through the windshield. The man's body is halfway out through the passenger door. The alarm has gone off.]
2515,12,11,Shelly Marsh,Oh my Gohhhd!
2516,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Oh no, I'm way too startled!"
2517,12,11,Sharon Marsh,"[points up to the sky] Look! [three jet fighters swoop in from somewhere and fire missiles at the G. Rex, but it remains unscathed]"
2518,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, they can't kill it! [turns his camera to Shelly] What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly? [she's scared, but moves closer to the street to get a better look. This puts her in the same frame as the G. Rex] Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly. [Shelly turns around frozen in fear] Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?"
2519,12,11,Sharon Marsh,Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
2520,12,11,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. [she rears back and smacks the camera out of his hand]"
2521,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"Wait here a minute. [nearby a huge golden Incan idol holds a stick and a pan flute. Chertoff approaches it and opens his arms] Behold! I am standing on your precious land! I've waited a long time for this! [unzips his pants and urinates on the statue, mocking it with laughter]"
2522,12,11,Soldier 6,What's he doing?
2523,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me! [there's some sound to his left and he turns to see what it is. It's Craig climbing over a wall and dusting himself off. Chertoff approaches him in anger] Craiiig! [the other four boys appear behind Craig] No! How did you get here?!
2524,12,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!"
2525,12,11,Soldier 6,"Sir, ih-is everything all right?"
2526,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),Shoot them!
2527,12,11,Soldier 7,Shoot them?
2528,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.
2529,12,11,Stan Marsh,"No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands."
2530,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),I said shoot them!
2531,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
2532,12,11,Top Official,"Maybe we should look at it, sir."
2533,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!"
2534,12,11,Craig Tucker,I didn't say anything.
2535,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"[begins his speech] You see, for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the Guinea Valley of Peru. The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay: by playing pan flute music. Guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do. But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and I have made that happen! The Incas predicted the world would be saved... by Craig. But that part of the prophecy will not come true! For you will all die on this mountain! [one of the soldiers fires his rifle and the bullets pierce through Chertoff's chest, leaving a large hole. Chertoff looks at the hole and cackles]"
2536,12,11,Top Official,"You're, you're some kind of monster."
2537,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"[ominously] Oh, I'm much more than that. Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes, I am something much more evil! [he begins to transform. His mouth becomes a round orifice with a few teeth inside, then into a horrible beast with many teeth in his mouth and a pirate costume on his body, and finally, a giant guinea pirate] Arrrgh."
2538,12,11,Top Official,Guinea pirate! [dives into the bushes]
2539,12,11,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
2540,12,11,Craig Tucker,"Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? [walks onto a square with a pattern on it. The circle in the center of the pattern lights up and begins to rotate up and out. Two stone slabs jut out from the pillar. The golden idol's eyes light up. A beam of light goes from the idol's staff to one of the slabs, and two beams of lightning come out of Craig's eyes and strike the guinea pirate]"
2541,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"Dargh, no!"
2542,12,11,Craig Tucker,"Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes."
2543,12,11,Michael Chertoff (Guinea Pirate),"Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh. [the guinea pirate falls on its back and the beams turn off. The slabs go back into the pillar and the pillar rotates back into the ground. The four boys approach Craig, stunned at what just happened. Craig lets out a big sigh of relief]"
2544,12,11,Craig Tucker,"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released, [a shot of that is shown; happy pan flute musicians] and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains. [shots from all over are shown, specifically South Park and New York City: pan flute bands are driving the guinea creatures away] Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed. [shots of the cleanup are shown. The Marshes are among the rescued] All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen."
2545,12,11,Randy Marsh,"[trying to show a video clip to two firemen] Here here, look, look! [there's no picture] What the? [opens the camera to check it out] Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. [someone else took a picture of that, though]"
2546,12,11,Craig Tucker,"The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days. [the guinea pirate is taken to the Washington D.C. State Penitentiary strapped down to a flatbed truck. Next, a shot of Paris is shown: a Peruvian flute band plays at the Champs Elysées] And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security. [Top Official 1 and Official 3 drop him off and smile at the joyful parents] My parents were sooo happy. [a shot of Craig looking at himself in the mirror, reflecting on the events surrounding his trip to Peru] I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us. [a shot of Craig in bed, just after bedtime] We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. [a shot of the boys dressed as Mariachis standing at Craig's front porch talking to him; he slams the door in their faces.]"
2547,12,11,Eric Cartman,That guy's an asshole!
2548,12,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what a dick!"
2549,12,11,Kenny McCormick,(I fuckin' hate Craig!)
2550,12,11,Top Official 2,"[enters the office without warning] Sir! Sir, we have a problem!"
2551,12,11,New Director,What now?!
2552,12,11,Top Official 2,"The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell."
2553,12,11,New Director,"My God, are you telling me..?"
2554,12,11,Top Official 2,"Yes sir. It broke out of prison. [heavy footfalls are felt throughout Washington D.C. Car alarms go off, people scream, and a large guinea pig in striped prison uniform appears. The camera shuts off.]"
2555,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. [a cheer goes up in the audience]"
2556,12,12,Randy Marsh,Yyeeaahh!!!! [pumps his beer can up and down a couple of times] Obama! [runs around] WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
2557,12,12,Gerald Broflovski,[stands up] Yyeeaahh!!!!
2558,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America."
2559,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!"
2560,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him ""Sparkles""."
2561,12,12,Randy Marsh,[kneels before the TV] He's so awesome! [runs his hand over the screen a few times] He's so perfect and awesome!
2562,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can."
2563,12,12,Supporters for Obama (the Revelers) and McCain,[in Chicago] Yes we can!
2564,12,12,Randy Marsh,Yes I can! Yes I can! [the others watch him run out of the house]
2565,12,12,Randy Marsh,Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! [people nearby gather around the front steps]
2566,12,12,Mr Harris,Did you see? Our man is in! [among the gathering crowd are Mr. Adler and the Blacks.]
2567,12,12,Mrs Harris,We did it!
2568,12,12,Mr Adler,Everything is going to be awesome now!
2569,12,12,Randy Marsh,This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
2570,12,12,Linda Black,I don't even know what to do now.
2571,12,12,Randy Marsh,I know what to do! [steps into the street and cups his hands on his cheeks so as to amplify his voice] Losers! Looosers!
2572,12,12,Crowd,[outside] Looosers! Looosers!
2573,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, shut up!"
2574,12,12,Crowd,Looosers!
2575,12,12,Butters Stotch,We lost?
2576,12,12,Senator John McCain,"[giving his concession speech] It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."
2577,12,12,Supporters for Obama (the Revelers) and McCain,No no! Noo nooo!
2578,12,12,Butters Stotch,"Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad."
2579,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"[gets up and walks to the TV] No. No, this can't happen! No! [kicks the TV screen, causing it to short and shatter]"
2580,12,12,Linda Stotch,Stephen!
2581,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead."
2582,12,12,Linda Stotch,"You don't know that, Stephen!"
2583,12,12,Mr Mackey,"With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!"
2584,12,12,Mr Garrison,We'll probably be dead by sunrise!
2585,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... [someone pounds on the door. Stephen and Butters look over and the door opens. It's Randy]"
2586,12,12,Randy Marsh,WOOOO Obama!
2587,12,12,Mr Garrison,Get out o'here!
2588,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, have you seen my parents? [Ike begins to cry]"
2589,12,12,Stan Marsh,"No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?"
2590,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"He was a McCain supporter. [Ike cries harder] It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine."
2591,12,12,Reporter 1,"Uh Mr. President, over here!"
2592,12,12,Reporter 2,Congratulations!
2593,12,12,Reporter 3,"Great start, great job!"
2594,12,12,Reporter 4,Change!
2595,12,12,Reporter 5,"Great job, Mr. President!"
2596,12,12,Reporter 6,"Great job, Obama!"
2597,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest. [steps through double doors at the other end of the hall and closes them behind him. A man walks out of the shadows as Obama turns away from the doors] Senator McCain."
2598,12,12,Senator John McCain,"President Obama. [the two men step up and face each other, then start to giggle, then roar with laughter. They give each other a high-five and a low-five.]"
2599,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Boom, baby!"
2600,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Boom, baby!"
2601,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Ohoh man that was perfect! [works on removing his jacket]
2602,12,12,Senator John McCain,[pulls out a cell phone and starts calling someone] I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.
2603,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"You played it perfectly, there was no way."
2604,12,12,Senator John McCain,"It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President."
2605,12,12,Davis,"Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?"
2606,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours."
2607,12,12,Davis,"Sure. Hard part's over, right?"
2608,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Actually, the hard part's just starting."
2609,12,12,Reveler 1,[gulps down a beer] Yoohoo!
2610,12,12,Reveler 2,"Obama yeah, I can't believe it!"
2611,12,12,Randy Marsh,O ba ma! O ba ma!
2612,12,12,Revelers,O ba ma! O ba ma!
2613,12,12,Randy Marsh,Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on! [reaches a keg of beer and serves himself some into a mug] It's Obamobama! [someone walks by and just throws up]
2614,12,12,Stan Marsh,"Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. [outside the music changes to ""Who Let The Dogs Out?"" Someone swings from a traffic light and falls. A truck full of young adults rolls by]"
2615,12,12,Crowd,Obama!
2616,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Who let the Obama out? [moments later a police car rolls down the street, slowly going through the crowd] Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!"
2617,12,12,Crowd,OooooOOOOooo! [Officer Barbrady stops the cruiser and hops out of it]
2618,12,12,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!"
2619,12,12,Randy Marsh,BOOOO! [other people join in the booing]
2620,12,12,Reveler,...party Obama!
2621,12,12,Officer Barbrady,"Come on, time to go home."
2622,12,12,Randy Marsh,What are you? A McCain voter?
2623,12,12,Crowd,Yeah!
2624,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Sorry pal, but Obama's President now! [walks towards Barbrady, and his pants begin to fall to his ankles] Obama! Obama! [walks past him and towards the police car]"
2625,12,12,Crowd,Obama! Obama!
2626,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! [other revelers walk up and help out]"
2627,12,12,Officer Barbrady,"Ey, put down my car! [Randy and the revelers succeed in flipping the car over]"
2628,12,12,Revelers,"Yes we can! [they move in and keep rocking the car as the music switches to ""Mickey"".]"
2629,12,12,Officer Barbrady,"No! No! Hey, stop it!"
2630,12,12,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ...
2631,12,12,Randy Marsh,"O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! [Cartman rolls by in his Big Wheels trike, pulling a cart full of TVs]"
2632,12,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]"
2633,12,12,Quincy,Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!
2634,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever."
2635,12,12,Neely,I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.
2636,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Always workin' the angles.
2637,12,12,Senator John McCain,"My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history."
2638,12,12,Quincy,"So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time? [Obama and McCain look at each other knowingly. The next scene shows a huge diamond necklace]"
2639,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars."
2640,12,12,Davis,Two hundred ten?
2641,12,12,Senator John McCain,Million.
2642,12,12,Quincy,"No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that."
2643,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built. [Two security guards go around closing the exhibits for the night] The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system. [the guards walk out of a room and turn on the laser system as they exit] There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached."
2644,12,12,Davis,"So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top."
2645,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.
2646,12,12,Quincy,"Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond. [Obama walks over to the computer and turns it on, stepping aside for McCain]"
2647,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel, [a simulation begins to play on the computer monitors] A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum."
2648,12,12,Neely,"Boom, baby!"
2649,12,12,Davis,"Boom, baby!"
2650,12,12,Senator John McCain,"You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on."
2651,12,12,Quincy,"So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel."
2652,12,12,Senator John McCain,And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
2653,12,12,Quincy,This all sounds very risky.
2654,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,[walks across the floor] We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-
2655,12,12,Neely,And we are.
2656,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,[turns around] -we won't get caught.
2657,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won."
2658,12,12,Stan Marsh,"[walks in from the dining room] Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here."
2659,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
2660,12,12,Stan Marsh,Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
2661,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God! [drops the phone and follows Stan to Ike]
2662,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for! [Ike begins to cry] I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay. [Ike mumbles something to him] No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan. [Ike says something more] Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something. [The camera zooms out to show that the window is barely off the ground. Ike cries, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it."
2663,12,12,Ike Broflovski|nab,Good-bye. [falls from the window sill and lands on the ground face down]
2664,12,12,Stan Marsh,NOO!
2665,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,NOO!
2666,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,Ike? [no response] Oh crap Ike?
2667,12,12,Chief of Security,"All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3."
2668,12,12,SS Agent,"Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem."
2669,12,12,Chief of Security,What?
2670,12,12,SS Agent,The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office.
2671,12,12,Chief of Security,Barack Obama? [next scene shows Barack Obama walking through the White House]
2672,12,12,SS Agent 2,"They're all, they're all right through here, sir."
2673,12,12,Chief of Security,"[interrupting as Obama enters] Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama?"
2674,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?
2675,12,12,Chief of Security,"Good, sir."
2676,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?"
2677,12,12,Chief of Security,Right now?
2678,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff."
2679,12,12,Chief of Security,"[backs up towards the Oval Office] Sure, right this way, Mr... President. [opens the doors to the office]"
2680,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"[enters the office] I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?"
2681,12,12,Chief of Security,Yes sir. [Obama places a bill into the Chief's jacket breast pocket]
2682,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Thanks. [closes the doors]
2683,12,12,Chief of Security,I got a hundred dollars. [grins]
2684,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"All right, McCain. I'm in."
2685,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian. [he's with a construction team] You find the escape tunnel?"
2686,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,I'm already on it. [plugs a hacking device into an electronic lock hidden under a panel on the desktop; it quickly starts crunching numbers in trying to decode the password. Once it decodes the right password the desk moves to one side and the secret passage is revealed] Boom baby.
2687,12,12,Reveler 3,Yehhheheah!
2688,12,12,Randy Marsh,"[even more drunk than before, serves himself more beer] Wooo, change."
2689,12,12,Reveler 4,Change.
2690,12,12,Reveler 5,Change.
2691,12,12,Stan Marsh,"[running up to him with Kyle] Dad Dad, we have a problem."
2692,12,12,Randy Marsh,Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
2693,12,12,Stan Marsh,"No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital."
2694,12,12,Randy Marsh,"We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore."
2695,12,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's wasted."
2696,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! [walks over]"
2697,12,12,Randy s Boss,"Oh, hello Marsh."
2698,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! [Stan and Kyle are stunned]"
2699,12,12,Randy s Boss,Huh?
2700,12,12,Randy Marsh,"You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!"
2701,12,12,Stan Marsh,"[quite concerned] Dad, what are you doing?!"
2702,12,12,Randy Marsh,"It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit [gives him the finger again] You know what Obama said? Yes we can!"
2703,12,12,Randy s Boss,"Hey, I voted for Obama."
2704,12,12,Randy Marsh,Obama's not talkin' about you!
2705,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks around] Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. [Randy punches his boss in the face and his boss just leaves, holding his hands over his nose]"
2706,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009. [the cameras die down and everyone is a bit aghast at her statement]
2707,12,12,Reporter 1,"Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?"
2708,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,"Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but [her cell phone begins to ring] Oh, my phone's going ringy. Ex-cuse me. [steps away from the podium and off the stage to her left. She answers the phone at a safe distance from the stage] Hello?"
2709,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Hello Sarah, it's McCain."
2710,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,[switches to a British accent] I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.
2711,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum."
2712,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.
2713,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,God she's awesome.
2714,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,"[returns to the podium and a normal voice] Oh, I guess Senator McCain's gonna fly me back to Alaska now. He's got a private jet, you know? Okay, byebye then. [walks off to her right] Bloody idiots. [she walks out of the headquarters through a side door, tosses off her red business suit and walks towards the camera in a catsuit. She whips out some sais and spins them around like pistols]"
2715,12,12,Senator John McCain,"All right, here we go. [a piledriver is turned on and a massive pile is lifted up, then dropped. Shockwaves spread out each time the pile hits the ground]"
2716,12,12,Guard 1,What's that noise?
2717,12,12,Guard 2,"It's okay, just some construction outside. [Obama prepares a charge and sets it off, and light enters the tunnel. Obama has broken into the Smithsonian. He pops his head through the hole]"
2718,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Oh no. [presses a button on his headset] McCain? We've got a problem. [the lasers are now blue instead of red]
2719,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help."
2720,12,12,Stan Marsh,"[points ahead] Hey, there's some people. [ahead of them is a garage that has been converted into a cave. Stephen Stotch and the other McCain supporters are there putting stuff away. Stephen is holding a crowd of other McCain supporters at bay with a rifle.]"
2721,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. [above the garage door is the work ""A.RK""]"
2722,12,12,Supporter 1,You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!
2723,12,12,Woman Supporter 1,Who are you to turn us away?!
2724,12,12,Stephen Stotch,I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
2725,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, excuse me, but we need some help."
2726,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!"
2727,12,12,Supporter 2,You're going to deny them too?
2728,12,12,Supporter 1,"[throws down his sleeping bag] For God's sake, man, they're children! [kneels next to Stan] Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't take them in! [tugs on Stan's cheeks] Look at their little cheeks!"
2729,12,12,Stan Marsh,"Let go of my face, asshole!"
2730,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"All right, damn you! The children can come in!"
2731,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!"
2732,12,12,Supporter 3,"Okay, then I want their place."
2733,12,12,Supporter 4,Me too.
2734,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,We NEED a ride to the hospital!
2735,12,12,Supporter 1,THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A HOSPITAL! DON'T YOU GET IT?!
2736,12,12,Woman Supporter 2,"Let us in now! [Stephen smacks her away, and a brawl follows]"
2737,12,12,Mr Garrison,"Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!"
2738,12,12,Supporter 5,Obama hasn't been elected four hours and already the country's going to hell! [another supporter smacks him down from behind. Stan and Kyle just leave and resume their walk]
2739,12,12,Chief of Security,"Mr. Obama? [tries to open it, but can't] Sir? [looks to another Secret Service agent] All right, give me the keys. [the door opens before the agent could reach for the keys. Barack Obama dusts himself off]"
2740,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Is there a problem, gentlemen?"
2741,12,12,Chief of Security,"Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?"
2742,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?"
2743,12,12,Chief of Security,"Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here."
2744,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,My wife?
2745,12,12,Michelle Obama,"[appears behind the agents] Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?"
2746,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"[pulls her into the Oval Office] Uh, c-c-come on in, darling. [appears at the doorway again] Thank, thank you boys. [closes and locks the doors]"
2747,12,12,Michelle Obama,"Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?"
2748,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Michelle, there's something I need to tell you."
2749,12,12,Michelle Obama,"What is it? [Obama stays quiet] Barack, what is it?!"
2750,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.
2751,12,12,Michelle Obama,You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?
2752,12,12,Senator John McCain,"[wearing a huge fake mustache] Hi, Michelle."
2753,12,12,Michelle Obama,[removes the Bluetooth device from Obama's right ear and places it on her own] You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!
2754,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay."
2755,12,12,Michelle Obama,"On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!"
2756,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,"Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes."
2757,12,12,Michelle Obama,Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.
2758,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Did you catch that, Davis?"
2759,12,12,Davis,I'm on it.
2760,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. [they enter the ER and see a lot of patients in there. One man has an Obama flag stuck up his ass. The clock reads 9 p.m., so it must be broken]"
2761,12,12,Nurse at Hell's Pass Hospital,"[showing an Obama patient where to wait] There, just take a seat over there."
2762,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[getting the nurse's attention] E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention."
2763,12,12,Nurse at Hell's Pass Hospital,Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?
2764,12,12,Stan Marsh,Why does that matter?
2765,12,12,Nurse at Hell's Pass Hospital,"Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. [on one side of the ER are Obama supporters who are suffering the effects of too much partying, and on the other are McCain supporters who have more serious wounds]"
2766,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help."
2767,12,12,Nurse at Hell's Pass Hospital,"You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere."
2768,12,12,Stan Marsh,So where's the other doctor? [the nurse opens a door behind her and the other doctor... is hanging from a noose attached to the ceiling]
2769,12,12,Randy Marsh,"[walking in suddenly towards the Obama side] Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking. [moans come up from all over the ER as people cover their ears] And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. [a McCain supporter tries to hasten his death by smashing a corkscrew into his head]"
2770,12,12,Michelle Obama,I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?
2771,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Did you really not like pretending to be married?
2772,12,12,Michelle Obama,"Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B."
2773,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.
2774,12,12,Michelle Obama,"My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it."
2775,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"[to everyone connected to his bluetooth unit] All right, everyone. We're about to go. So here's the revised schedule: 4:40 a.m., the team gathers at the northwest exit of the museum. [the heist is shown taking place as Obama goes through the schedule] 4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors."
2776,12,12,Michelle Obama,Go! [Obama takes off]
2777,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew. [Obama opens the vault door and McCain and the others walk in] 5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum."
2778,12,12,Grandma Obama,"I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch."
2779,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs. [above them, Palin crawls across the ceiling like Spider-Man towards the entrance] 5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm. [Palin drops down and hangs upside down. She lifts the glass display cover from the diamond and swipes the Hope Diamond from its display case. McCain is spotted and flees]"
2780,12,12,A Guard,Hey you! Stop!
2781,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched. [Davis and Neely act as repairmen and seal up the hole] 5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus."
2782,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"[to the Secret Service] All done. Thanks. [Barack and Michelle head outside, towards a limousine. The door opens and McCain is waiting for them. They enter and take their seats, and the limousine rolls off. The rest of the team looks at the three of them, and they all laugh. Obama takes the diamond out of his ass and displays it for all to see.]"
2783,12,12,All,"Boom, baby!"
2784,12,12,Quincy,There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?
2785,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago. [a plane sits all by itself in a field somewhere. The interior is full of dummies. Nearby, in a recovery room, Ike rises from his bed as Stan and Kyle look off into space. He presses a button and the plane blows up: the plane was landed near Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan and Kyle hear the explosion and quickly turn around and look outside]"
2786,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell? [they observe the burning plane. Ike sneaks away while the boys are distracted. He dashes across the hall to the coroner's office and enters it. He hops onto a chair and attaches a USB stick to a computer, and begins typing. Dossiers of the heist team members pop up and Ike classifies each one as deceased. The door opens, and Kyle and Stan enter] Ike?"
2787,12,12,Ike Broflovski|nab,"Boom, baby."
2788,12,12,Flight Attendant,"Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez."
2789,12,12,Senator John McCain,Thank you very much.
2790,12,12,Quincy,"Well friends, let us depart."
2791,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye."
2792,12,12,Neely,Wha?
2793,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot."
2794,12,12,Senator John McCain,"B, you can't be serious."
2795,12,12,Quincy,"Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember?"
2796,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Could have been I didn't make that flight. [walks up to Michelle] What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while."
2797,12,12,Michelle Obama,You're serious.
2798,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?
2799,12,12,Michelle Obama,"Aww, what the fuck. [they begin to kiss, and the other members of the team wave goodbye and head for the plane]"
2800,12,12,Senator John McCain,I just looove happy endings.
2801,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"It's still here, ih... it's all still here."
2802,12,12,Mr Garrison,Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?
2803,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right."
2804,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Uhh... [sits up and tries to rub his eyes, but he's got a headache] Oh ow. [walks forward...] Hey, where are my pants? [looks at the table the TV is missing from] Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!"
2805,12,12,Stan Marsh,"Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired."
2806,12,12,Randy Marsh,"[surprised] Oh! [is pissed off again] Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! [kicks a side table away and walks off]"
2807,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. [Kenny indeed has a plain bologna sandwich and a glass of water.]"
2808,12,13,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again."
2809,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,What's High School Musical 3?
2810,12,13,Clyde Donovan,"You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2."
2811,12,13,Stan Marsh,What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
2812,12,13,Eric Cartman,There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
2813,12,13,Jason White,"What's High School Musical 1 and... Dude, it's only the most popular thing with kids in our age group!"
2814,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?
2815,12,13,Craig Tucker,Peru.
2816,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo."
2817,12,13,Millie Larsen,Bridon Gueermo? Oh he's such a dream!
2818,12,13,Red,"I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody."
2819,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. [stands on the bench in place]

Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! [the girls begin to snap their fingers]"
2820,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble."
2821,12,13,Girls Table,"That's what bein' friends is about.
[Cue full instrumentation]
(Oh ye-ah)
[the girls stand on the benches and face the boys]
Everyone is special in their own way, and we'll always be together as one."
2822,12,13,Eric Cartman,[puzzled] What the hell are they doing?
2823,12,13,Girls Table,- Together as one -
2824,12,13,Stan Marsh,I have no idea. [the other boys turn in their seats to get a better view]
2825,12,13,Girls Table,"As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way."
2826,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Dude, girls are such fags. [suddenly, Clyde, Craig, Jimmy, Token, and Jason leave the table and join the girls]"
2827,12,13,Kids,"Oh yeah, oh yeah!"
2828,12,13,Boys,[Dancing] Boys... are special in their own way.
2829,12,13,Girls,[Dancing] Girls... are special like a birthday.
2830,12,13,Kids,We'll always be dancin' and singin' aloud. Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh!
2831,12,13,Heidi Turner,"Here he comes. [the boys make way for a new boy, Bridon Gueermo, who dances towards the camera]"
2832,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"I like havin' fun in the hot summer sun (wooo!)
An' groovin' to the beat when my homework is all done. (yeah!)
If you ask me what I know, then you know what I will say?
That every single body is special in their own way."
2833,12,13,Stan Marsh,[while the boy is singing] Who the hell is that?
2834,12,13,Butters Stotch,"Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody."
2835,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"[swooning, walks over to the boys] He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times."
2836,12,13,Kids,Everyone is special in their own way
2837,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Special in their own way!
2838,12,13,Kids,Move to the beat and let your spirit out!
2839,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Let it out! Party people!
2840,12,13,Kids,"As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about."
2841,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
2842,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out..."
2843,12,13,Singers,"You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!

That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-"
2844,12,13,Eric Cartman,"This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. [silence follows for a few seconds, then Stan holds up the DVD case]"
2845,12,13,Stan Marsh,Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
2846,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
2847,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm out guys. [get up from the sofa, puts on his jacket, and heads for the front door] If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends."
2848,12,13,Stan Marsh,"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it."
2849,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
2850,12,13,Kenny McCormick,(No way in hell I'm doing it.)
2851,12,13,Stan Marsh,"All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. [holds up his right hand. Kyle holds his right hand up as well, and Kenny holds up his left]"
2852,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,I swear
2853,12,13,Kenny McCormick,(I swear too.)
2854,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Okay, good."
2855,12,13,Eric Cartman,Ehhhhhhh. [Stan stops writing]
2856,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
2857,12,13,Eric Cartman,I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
2858,12,13,Stan Marsh,But you didn't die?
2859,12,13,Eric Cartman,"...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. [The bell rings and Mr. Garrison walks in with his books]"
2860,12,13,Mr Garrison,"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats. [the last few kids take their seats] Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall. [He writes ""Berlin Wall"" on the chalkboard] This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side."
2861,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"[stands up on the seat of her desk] East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. [some kids begin to snap their fingers]"
2862,12,13,Bebe Stevens,As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
2863,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,Aw man.
2864,12,13,Class,Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat
2865,12,13,Mr Garrison,"[beaming] Oh, you kids. [Stan buries his face in his hand]"
2866,12,13,Class,"Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along."
2867,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[enters the classroom]  East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free."
2868,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. [Stan looks at them both and begins to worry that Bridon might sweep her away]
2869,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along."
2870,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along."
2871,12,13,Class,"East siiide, west siiide, east siiide..."
2872,12,13,Eric Cartman,[looking around and getting pissed off] God this sucks!
2873,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?"
2874,12,13,Stan Marsh,I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
2875,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,"M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-"
2876,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Stop. [holds his left hand out, palm out, for emphasis, and walks away. Jimmy stops singing]"
2877,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,All righty then.
2878,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Wendy] Uh, Wendy?"
2879,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,[looks at him] Hey Stan.
2880,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should."
2881,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,What?
2882,12,13,Stan Marsh,"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
2883,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, that's ridiculous."
2884,12,13,Stan Marsh,It is?
2885,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,I would never leave you for Bridon.
2886,12,13,Stan Marsh,[brightens up] Really?
2887,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. [shuts her locker and walks away, kissing Stan on the left cheek. Jimmy arrives two second later]"
2888,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,"There you go. Feel better, p-pal? [Stan stays quiet]"
2889,12,13,Stan Marsh,"What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away. [at an intersection he takes a left turn] I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him. [kids appear behind him and follow him] But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse? [noticing the finger-snapping, he stops walking and looks around. The kids wait for him to start singing and dancing] No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!"
2890,12,13,Kids,Awww. [murmurs follow]
2891,12,13,Stan Marsh,"No, fuck off. I'm not doing it."
2892,12,13,Kids,"Awww. [more murmuring. As they disperse, Butters walks up to Stan]"
2893,12,13,Butters Stotch,"Awww jeez, you're no fun. [turns right and walks away. At the other end of the hall, Bridon rounds a corner and dances down the hallway in Stan's direction]"
2894,12,13,Bebe Stevens,Hey Bridon.
2895,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Hey.
2896,12,13,Lola,Hi Bridon
2897,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Hi.
2898,12,13,Heidi Turner,Hey Bridon.
2899,12,13,Millie Larsen,Hey Bridon.
2900,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Hey.
2901,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[now hiding behind a corner. Bridon passes by him unaware] Hey, kid, over here. [Bridon looks around and finds Stan, then walks over to him] Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit."
2902,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Huh?
2903,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed."
2904,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,They are?
2905,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me, [gets stern] you're driving everyone crazy."
2906,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.
2907,12,13,Stan Marsh,You don't like doing it?
2908,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
2909,12,13,Stan Marsh,Basketball?
2910,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
2911,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!"
2912,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I can't.
2913,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[firmly] Yes, you can. What's stopping you?"
2914,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[sighs deeply] It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
2915,12,13,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!"
2916,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Really?
2917,12,13,Stan Marsh,"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team."
2918,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. [walks away]
2919,12,13,Stan Marsh,[proud of himself] Sweet.
2920,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"Sit up properly, Bridon. You know how strict your father is about posture. [serves out the casserole] All right dear, dinner's ready!"
2921,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"[struts in, checks himself out in the mirror, and takes his seat at the head of the table] Okay, let's eat!"
2922,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'."
2923,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Ooo, that sounds emotional! [holds his hand against his ear to listen better] What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time."
2924,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"No, Dad, can we just talk?"
2925,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"If you can talk it, you can sing it. [gets up and dances to the mirror again] You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-"
2926,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, I want to join the basketball team. [his Dad is upset. He turns around and faces Bridon]"
2927,12,13,Mr Gueermo,What did you say?
2928,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
2929,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
2930,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"But Dad, it's what I really want."
2931,12,13,Mr Gueermo,There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
2932,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I know. That's kind of why I like it.
2933,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club."
2934,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"It's my life, Dad!"
2935,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Don't make me slap you! [raises his right hand up, ready to slap] I will slap your face so super hard... [Bridon quickly leaves the table and his dad sits back down] I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!"
2936,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Maybe you should let him try it.
2937,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"What did you say, woman?!"
2938,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,You aren't being fair.
2939,12,13,Mr Gueermo,That's it! I'm gonna slap you!
2940,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"No, please."
2941,12,13,Mr Gueermo,[begins to sing and slap] I slap you!
2942,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Ahh!
2943,12,13,Mr Gueermo,I slap you!
2944,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Ohh!
2945,12,13,Mr Gueermo,I slap slap slap you!
2946,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Dohh!
2947,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Slapping you slapping you silly 'cause you disrespected me.
2948,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Ooohohoo.
2949,12,13,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class."
2950,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd."
2951,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Fuck you, Kyle! [upon entering the building, they are met by a pre-class musical production]"
2952,12,13,Kids,"And you know, we're together at school again."
2953,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,School again.
2954,12,13,Stan Marsh,Aww!
2955,12,13,Kids,"With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever."
2956,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, shut up!"
2957,12,13,Kids,Together at school again. What a special day.
2958,12,13,Eric Cartman,Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
2959,12,13,Kids,"We could say that neverrrrrrrrrrr
Goes away."
2960,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!"
2961,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom."
2962,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself! [sees someone down the hall] Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett. [Mr. Garrett, the school coach, is eating an apple] This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good."
2963,12,13,Mr Garrett,Really?
2964,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[looks down and away] Look, I should be getting to class."
2965,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department."
2966,12,13,Stan Marsh,"You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate."
2967,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I don't know...
2968,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team."
2969,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!"
2970,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Okay.
2971,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Aayy, that's great, Bridon."
2972,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Thanks.
2973,12,13,Jason White,We might have a chance at winning now. [the doors open at the far end of the gym and Mr. Gueermo enters]
2974,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Bridon! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!
2975,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, I was just messin' around."
2976,12,13,Mr Gueermo,I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
2977,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Eh, your kid is really good at this."
2978,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! [Bridon puts his ams up in self-defense]"
2979,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Just... go easy on him, huh?"
2980,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"[gasps, then raises his right hand up to strike] You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!"
2981,12,13,Mr Garrett,"If he wants to play ball, you should let him."
2982,12,13,Mr Gueermo,I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!
2983,12,13,Mr Garrett,He's just a kid.
2984,12,13,Mr Gueermo,[slap] You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. [slap]
2985,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, stop!"
2986,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself [slaps with his left hand this time] There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you- [right-hand slap] Slap it, I'll slap it! [left-hand slap. He then pulls Bridon out of the gym.]"
2987,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me."
2988,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Shut up, Bridon! [as he reaches the doors, they open and Mr. Mackey appears]"
2989,12,13,Mr Mackey,"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?"
2990,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?! [Mackey doesn't reply, but he slaps him anyway] I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! [exits the gym, but returns to slap Mackey again, then leaves again]"
2991,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?! [Stan watches them walk by, his plan dashed] You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!"
2992,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,You're hurting my arm.
2993,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Stupid-ass boy!
2994,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[sighs deeply] Ah, shit."
2995,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle. [Stan walks into the living room and stands to one side of the sofa] Yeah, nice."
2996,12,13,Stan Marsh,"You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it."
2997,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,What? Are you crazy?
2998,12,13,Eric Cartman,No way dude.
2999,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"We promised each other we would never do that, remember?"
3000,12,13,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
3001,12,13,Stan Marsh,"I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake."
3002,12,13,Scott Malkinson,What's so bad about hanging out with me?
3003,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."""
3004,12,13,Scott Malkinson,"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!"
3005,12,13,Eric Cartman,"""Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" [Kenny laughs]"
3006,12,13,Stan Marsh,"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?"
3007,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too."
3008,12,13,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
3009,12,13,Stan Marsh,"That isn't true! [no one challenges] Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids"
3010,12,13,Scott Malkinson,"Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack."
3011,12,13,Eric Cartman,"""That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."""
3012,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. [the doorbell rings and Mr. Gueermo pauses the video and prances to the door. He opens it and two adults appear]
3013,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),Mister... Gueermo?
3014,12,13,Mr Gueermo,[barks] What?
3015,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),[shows his official badge] We're from Child Protective Services. [puts it away] There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child?
3016,12,13,Mr Gueermo,What? Who the hell's been saying that?!
3017,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
3018,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),His name is Stan Marsh.
3019,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world o'hurt about to come your way!"
3020,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),"Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son."
3021,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"[performs a sweeping gesture to usher them in] Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! [the agents enter and walk over to Bridon]"
3022,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),"Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly. [Mr. Gueermo sneaks up behind him, ready to slap him at any moment] We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's okay and just maybe... [Mr. Gueermo whistles, Mr. Kelly turns around, and Mr. Gueermo slaps him]"
3023,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?! [slap] No, there's another one!"
3024,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),Oh my God!
3025,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"[moves over to the female agent] Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you! [slaps her] There's a slap for you! [three slaps follow] Slap, slap, slap! [slaps Mr. Kelly three more times] Yeah, there you go! [slaps the female agent again] Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap! [slaps the female agent, then slaps Mr. Kelly. Mrs. Gueermo rushes in to intervene and take the slaps]"
3026,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"Oh God, please, you have to get away! He won't ever stop! [he slaps her seven times]"
3027,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Awww. I'm going slap-happy! [chases after the agents and slaps them several more times before they finally reach their car] I'm going slap, slap happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house! [the agents pull away quickly. He notices his next door neighbor looking on from his own doorway] What are you looking at, Robertson? [in a flash he slaps Robertson three times, and just as quickly he's back inside his house and closes the front door.]"
3028,12,13,Bebe Stevens,They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! [the kids react and gather round the results sheet on the bulletin board. Butters is on a stool checking out the results for everyone]
3029,12,13,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. [the girls congratulate her and Wendy says something in reply]"
3030,12,13,Clyde Donovan,Who's the male lead?
3031,12,13,Butters Stotch,"No surprise there. It's Bridon. [the boys and a few girls congratulate Bridon, who stays quiet] I get to be a stand-in! [moments later Wendy catches up to Bridon. Stan looks on from a distance]"
3032,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together."
3033,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[not enthused] Yeah, great."
3034,12,13,Stan Marsh,"God damn it! [walks away. Next scene is him walking down the hall] No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop. [some kids look at him and decide to follow] And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? [he stops, the kids stop walking but continue snapping their fingers. Soon they smile in anticipation...]

Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
[the kids' anticipation fades. Stan isn't singing as they'd hope he would]
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
[Wendy, Bebe, and some other kids arrive]
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
[no one is making a sound. Stan puts his hands in his pockets, hangs his head, then turns left and walks away]"
3035,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-"
3036,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,[enters in a panic] Oh please. You have to do something.
3037,12,13,Mr Gueermo,What are you interrupting me for?!
3038,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"It's our son, he's- he's running away."
3039,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"What?! [rushes downstairs and stops with flair behind Bridon, who's steps away from the front door] What's going on here, what's this all about? [brings his arms up and out, pointing to Bridon at the end with his left hand] What do you think you're doing?"
3040,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-"
3041,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Nono! Sing it!
3042,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,[throws his duffle bag down] No! I'm sick of singing!
3043,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Can you believe it? What'd he just say? What's the matter with kids these days? [fixes his gaze on his wife, who's terrified for a bit.]"
3044,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"[slowly, carefully] Kids these days."
3045,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Kids these days! [Bridon ignores him and opens the door. His father flies through the air and slams the door shut with his body] Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!"
3046,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Just let me go.
3047,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Go ahead. Make my day. [gets down on his left knee and threatens] You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face! [Bridon punches him on the nose] Ow! [covers his nose and stands up] Oh my God, what was that? [runs to his wife] Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad! [she punches him harder] Ow. What the ""H"" is going on?! [she punches him again, and he runs off, crying. Bridon looks on in awe] What are you doing?! Everyone's crazy!"
3048,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
3049,12,13,Eric Cartman,I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
3050,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part."
3051,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
3052,12,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)"
3053,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!"
3054,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
3055,12,13,Stan Marsh,Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
3056,12,13,Scott Malkinson,"'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-"
3057,12,13,Eric Cartman,"You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson."
3058,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, guys. [gets off the sofa and walks away from the other boys] The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school. [turns around to face them] And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now, [points to them] everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you."
3059,12,13,Eric Cartman,"That's a low blow, Stan."
3060,12,13,Mr Mackey,"Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows."
3061,12,13,Mr Garrett,"All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?"
3062,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[approaches wearing #11] I'm ready, coach."
3063,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Give 'em hell! [Bridon goes in and faces off against the Bobcats' #9. He tosses the ball over to #7, Bradley, and then notices his parents on the bleachers. His mom waves hi, his dad looks away displeased.]"
3064,12,13,Mr Mackey,"Just a minute to go in the first quarter. [Bridon gets the ball back and shots from the top of the key for a 3 pointer. Everyone applauds him, but his father still isn't looking at him. Mr. Gueermo does, however, notice the crowd's excitement and soon gets into it himself. The song changes to ""We Will Rock You"" and the crowd gets into that with two stomps and a clap. Mr. Gueermo joins right in]"
3065,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?"
3066,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
3067,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,You gave it up?
3068,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[walks into view with the other three boys] That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. [music begins to play]

'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. [walks up to a boy and girl]
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. [walks back to Bridon]
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball"
3069,12,13,Eric Cartman,[approaches two other kids] But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
3070,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
[the four boys form a chorus line and dance]"
3071,12,13,Boys,"You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
[Kyle whips off his hat while approaching two girls]
True, girl, you know it's true, [returns to the chorus line] that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.
[Kyle dances away to two other girls]"
3072,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. [Cartman dances over to two kids]"
3073,12,13,Eric Cartman,"And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- [rejoins the chorus line with Kyle]"
3074,12,13,Boys,"Do what you wanna do.
Just make sure that what you're doing is what's cool and popular with everyone
Chew, baby, chew and chew.
When you're eating jerky, if eating jerky is what you wanna do."
3075,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"[arrives with Wendy, Red, and another girl during the song] Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?"
3076,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Uhh, sure. [the girls follow him to the gym. The other students go their separate ways.]"
3077,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Do what you want, don't have restraint."
3078,12,13,Eric Cartman,Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
3079,12,13,Kenny McCormick,"(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)"
3080,12,13,Stan Marsh,Try to do what you wanna do!
3081,12,13,Boys,"Do what you wanna do.
As long as what you wanna do is what everybody wants you to.
Glue, baby, buy some glue
Just in case if what you're doin' [Stan continues singing, they all keep dancing]"
3082,12,13,Stan Marsh,involves needing scissors and glue!
3083,12,13,Scott Malkinson,Hey guys. Hey guys! [all stop. Stan looks around and doesn't see anyone else]
3084,12,13,Stan Marsh,Huh? [the other boys turn around]
3085,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,Where did everybody go?
3086,12,13,Scott Malkinson,The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
3087,12,13,Stan Marsh,But the girls like singing and dancing.
3088,12,13,Scott Malkinson,"No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does."
3089,12,13,Stan Marsh,"But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!."
3090,12,14,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in ""x = y + 1"". M'kay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen."
3091,12,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. [Cartman is playing a video game set in World War II Japan]"
3092,12,14,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, now right-click on menu item ""Equate O"" and type in ""input y""."
3093,12,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? [looks like all the other kids are playing the same game]"
3094,12,14,Stan Marsh,"No, I'm on the Japanese side."
3095,12,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh, who just shot me? [Bebe leans back in her chair, looks at Cartman, and gives him the finger]"
3096,12,14,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right... [his voice trails off] uhhh, but then what the hell is the...? [closes the book and goes back to normal voice] Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay."
3097,12,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs."
3098,12,14,Butters Stotch,"[runs into the lab and hides behind the wall] Oh my God, oh my God! [runs up to Stan] Stan! Stan, we have a big problem."
3099,12,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what?"
3100,12,14,Butters Stotch,There's vampires in the school!
3101,12,14,Stan Marsh,What?
3102,12,14,Butters Stotch,Vampires. I've seen 'em.
3103,12,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!"
3104,12,14,Red,Not a cheat if you rank up.
3105,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Ugh. [goes over to Kenny] Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. Then Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!"
3106,12,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, there's no such thing as vampires."
3107,12,14,Butters Stotch,"[goes over to Kyle] But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything."
3108,12,14,Eric Cartman,"All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are."
3109,12,14,Butters Stotch,Really? Do you think that's best?
3110,12,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, now get out of here."
3111,12,14,Butters Stotch,"All right! [runs to the entrance, then turns around] If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. [turns back and runs out]"
3112,12,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!"

3143,12,14,Vampir,All right. [the Vamps and Goths face each other]
3144,12,14,Pete,"So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?"
3145,12,14,Vampir,"We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se."

3152,12,14,Other Vamps,Yeah.
3153,12,14,Pete,[buries his face in his left hand] Oh my God.
3154,12,14,Vampir,"You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se."
3155,12,14,Pete,"All right, Count Fagula, you go do that. [the Vamps leave]"
3156,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Mom, mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!"
3157,12,14,Linda Stotch,"[sewing a scarf] Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy."

3161,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?! [holds up the box] It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?! [Butters begins to tap his fists together, nervously] Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!"
3162,12,14,Butters Stotch,"I have no idea, sir."
3163,12,14,Stephen Stotch,I'll tell you why! [walks over to the pantry and opens the door] Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!
3164,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-it's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were-"
3165,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"What keeps a family together, Butters?!"
3166,12,14,Butters Stotch,A well-organized pantry.
3167,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"That's right! [starts throwing food out of the pantry on to the floor] If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong! [stops] Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!"
3168,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-"
3169,12,14,Stephen Stotch,You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
3170,12,14,Butters Stotch,[hangs his head] Yes sir. [Stephen walks away. Butters turns to the task at hand and begins putting stuff away] Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want.

3197,12,14,Vampir,"[walks into view] You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?"
3198,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I guess."
3199,12,14,Vampir,"Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave."
3200,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school."
3201,12,14,Vampir,"Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin! [they all walk away, leaving behind the Dr. Pepper and Twizzlers. They walk to South Park Mall] This way. Prepare thyself. [the mall is still open, so they walk over to Hot Topic and enter. The Vamps begin checking out clothes for Butters to wear as a new Vamp. The Midnight Vamp gets some fake teeth with fangs while the Cowlick Vamp gets some necklaces and rings. They outfit Butters with them. The Sparkly Vamp gets some hairspray and she and the Spiky Vamp spray Butters' hair with it. Bloodrayne measures him for collars and bracelets. Finally, all six Vamps step away, and a new Vamp is born]"
3202,12,14,Butters Stotch,Whoa.
3203,12,14,Vampir,"And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se! [walks away and pours out a bottle of Clamato juice into a goblet for Butters to drink] With this, thy transformation is done. [Butters takes a sip, then immediately spits it out]"

3205,12,14,Vampir,"It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. [Butters begins to laugh, then cackle.]"

3212,12,14,Butters Stotch,You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. [smiles knowingly. His parents are perplexed]

3228,12,14,Pete,Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. [they all look at each other thoughtfully]

He wiggles his fingers, then relaxes them and grips Cartman's head and back] Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. [rears back and bites into Cartman's neck, making sucking sounds. Cartman wakes up and looks at him]"
3236,12,14,Eric Cartman,Butters? [Butters continues] Butters?! [Butters backs up and then hops off the bed]

3243,12,14,Liane Cartman,What's going on?
3244,12,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!"

3259,12,14,Michael,What should we do with him?
3260,12,14,Pete,"Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart."
3261,12,14,Vampir,"(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)"
3262,12,14,Michael,[leans in and puts his hand to his left ear] What's that?
3263,12,14,Vampir,(I'm not really a vampire.)
3264,12,14,Michael,You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. [moves off and joins the other Goths]
3265,12,14,Pete,"If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way."
3266,12,14,Michael,How about we send him to Transylvania?

3271,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey! [Butters is in his bed, his arms crossed over his chest. On the headboard are four lit candles. He's hyperventilating] Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!"
3272,12,14,Butters Stotch,What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
3273,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door! [counts up with his fingers] One! Two! [the door is unlocked and opened a little. Stephen pushes the door in and it creaks. Stephen and Linda enter slowly. They see his window is wide open and he's not in bed. There are lit candles everywhere] Uhh, Bu-Butters?"
3274,12,14,Butters Stotch,Hey Dad. [he's crouching on top of his bookcase and startles Stephen]
3275,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!"
3276,12,14,Butters Stotch,I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
3277,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"[angrily] All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!"
3278,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Dahhh. [hops down from the bookcase and tries to hop onto his toy box, but he trips and lands on the floor. He gets up, climbs onto the toy box and crouches on the window sill, and hisses at them] I know now what I have to do! [hops down to the ground outside] Myah!"
3279,12,14,Linda Stotch,"[walks over to the open window] Stephen, what has happened to our boy?"

3286,12,14,Pete,They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
3287,12,14,Waitress,Looks the same to me.
3288,12,14,Pete,I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.
3289,12,14,Waitress,"[turns to face the Vamps] No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice. [turns left and walks away. Pete drops his head on the table and keeps it there]"

3296,12,14,Butters Stotch,I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. [the Goths look at each other]
3297,12,14,Pete,"Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?"
3298,12,14,Butters Stotch,Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
3299,12,14,Michael,Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.

3304,12,14,Singer,"Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it take your soul.

3305,12,14,Hot Topic Clerk,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
3306,12,14,Pete,"You should probably get out of here. [Firkle torches some clothes. Henrietta torches the fake teeth and products with fangs on them. Michael torches the sign announcing 25% off body jewelry and fashion belts. Outside, Bloodrayne and the Spiky Vamp arrive in shock]"
3307,12,14,Spiky Vamp,What the hell are they doing??
3308,12,14,Butters Stotch,They're putting an end to it! [the clerk runs out of the store]
3309,12,14,Hot Topic Clerk,"AAAAAAAAAAAAH! [the Goths continue torching the store until it's thoroughly engulfed in flames, then they walk out and leave. The Hot Topic sign above the entrance crashes to the floor.]"
3310,12,14,Butters Stotch,"[enters the living room happily] Mom, Dad! [closes the front door, runs to the sofa, and stands on the sofa between them.] I changed back!"
3311,12,14,Stephen Stotch,What?
3312,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!"
3313,12,14,Linda Stotch,"We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home."
3314,12,14,Stephen Stotch,That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.

3321,12,14,Pete,"[at the mic] Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's ""fun"", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. [everyone begins to applaud the speech. During the applause, Michael steps up to the mic and gives everyone the finger]"
3322,12,14,Michael,Fuck all of you.
