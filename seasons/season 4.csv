0,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom! MOOOM! Mom! [races down the stairs in pajamas, cap, and coat in the right hand and two dollars in the left one, and stops at Liane's feet] Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!"
1,4,1,Liane Cartman,"What is it, snookums?"
2,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! [shows them off] She's only given me a lousy quarter before!"
3,4,1,Liane Cartman,Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
4,4,1,Eric Cartman,[hops onto the sofa] Yeah! This is so tits!
5,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Don't say ""tits,"" Eric."
6,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I mean, this is so cool!"
7,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest."
8,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! [dons his coat]"
9,4,1,Liane Cartman,"But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving."
10,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later! [turns and walks out] Aw, man, this is so tits!"
11,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[off camera, heard running up] Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this! [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at Cartman] Oh my God, you guys, seriously! [runs around them] Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich! [turns to face them] Aren't you stoked?!"
12,4,1,Stan Marsh,What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
13,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,He's fat and he's stupid?
14,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[pants, then] Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! [presents the two dollars]"
15,4,1,Stan Marsh,Two dollars!
16,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,No way!
17,4,1,Stan Marsh,For one tooth?
18,4,1,Eric Cartman,For one tooth.
19,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter."
20,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
21,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits."
22,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,...Totally what?
23,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast."
24,4,1,Stan Marsh,Sega Dreamcast??
25,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,Sega Dreamcast??
26,4,1,Kenny McCormick,Sega Dreamcast??
27,4,1,Eric Cartman,All we need is teeth.
28,4,1,Stan Marsh,I already lost all my baby teeth.
29,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Me too. [Kenny says nothing, so the others look at him]"
30,4,1,Kenny McCormick,[covers his mouth] (Nuh-uh.)
31,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You still have baby teeth, Kenny?"
32,4,1,Kenny McCormick,(No way!)
33,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[moves to Kenny's side] Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast?"
34,4,1,Kenny McCormick,[punctuates] (No I don't! Thank you.)
35,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[ignoring the answer] Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!"
36,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?"
37,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[at the other end, tying the string to a wheelchair] Almost. You ready, Timmy?"
38,4,1,Timmy Burch,[the boy in the wheelchair] Timmiihh!
39,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?"
40,4,1,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
41,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,Right. You're Timmy.
42,4,1,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!
43,4,1,Kenny McCormick,(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
44,4,1,Eric Cartman,"I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. [tugs on Kenny's hood] ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny."
45,4,1,Kenny McCormick,[punctuates] (Fuck you!)
46,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright! Get ready, Timmy."
47,4,1,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
48,4,1,Butters Stotch,"[walks up] Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?"
49,4,1,Stan Marsh,"What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's."
50,4,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. [draws it from his pocket]"
51,4,1,Stan Marsh,You what?
52,4,1,Eric Cartman,You what?
53,4,1,Kenny McCormick,(You what?)
54,4,1,Timmy Burch,Timmih-
55,4,1,Butters Stotch,Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
56,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Butters, could we have it?"
57,4,1,Butters Stotch,"Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth."
58,4,1,Timmy Burch,Ha-a-ugh.
59,4,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, uh, see ya, fellas. [walks away]"
60,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to Stan] Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth."
61,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth."
62,4,1,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
63,4,1,Eric Cartman,How are we gonna get it from him?
64,4,1,Stan Marsh,I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
65,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, let's go. [the group begins to move when]"
66,4,1,Timmy Burch,"Go! Timmy go! [revs up, pulling Kenny] Yeah, Timmy! [drives until he runs out of string, then is jerked back]"
67,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Timmy, wait!"
68,4,1,Timmy Burch,"Engh go uh Timmy! [the string goes taut, and Kenny's face protrudes from his hood]"
69,4,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, guys!) [yanked from his suit into the air] (Heey-ungh) [lands naked in front of Cartman] (Oowww.)"
70,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha."
71,4,1,Timmy Burch,Hu-aah!
72,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Higher, you guys."
73,4,1,Stan Marsh,"[struggling with the pole with Kyle and Kenny] Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?"
74,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[bumps into the window] Agh! Careful, you assholes! [opens the window] To the left, you guys, left. [is moved to his left] No, camera left, camera left! [is moved in the other direction, towards Butters' head] That's it, now down. [is lowered, then reaches for the pillow]"
75,4,1,Butters Stotch,[wakes up] What the-? [rubs his eyes] Who's there? Who is that?!
76,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[in falsetto] I am the tooth fairy, my child."
77,4,1,Butters Stotch,"Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? [squeezes his eyelids shut]"
78,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. [reaches under and grabs Butters' tooth, then beholds the treasure. He then places some money under the pillow as Butters sneaks a peek.]"
79,4,1,Butters Stotch,"[as Cartman withdraws] Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat."
80,4,1,Eric Cartman,Ey!
81,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, fatass!"
82,4,1,Eric Cartman,Do not open your eyes until morning. [Butters has then shut real tight; Cartman tugs in the rope and is pulled out of the room] Or else I will kick you in the nuts. [drops down] Square in the nuts.
83,4,1,Butters Stotch,"Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!"
84,4,1,Stan Marsh,Well?
85,4,1,Eric Cartman,Bull's eye!
86,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night."
87,4,1,Eric Cartman,"I love that song, Mom. Sing it again."
88,4,1,Liane Cartman,"No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight."
89,4,1,Eric Cartman,Okay.
90,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Good night. [heads for the door. Cartman settles in and is about to place the tooth under the pillow] What do you have there, Eric?"
91,4,1,Eric Cartman,Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
92,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days."
93,4,1,Eric Cartman,"I know, huh?"
94,4,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys! [runs around them counterclockwise] Holy crap, you guys! I mean-"
95,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,Did the tooth fairy come?
96,4,1,Eric Cartman,Four dollars. [the other three answer at the same time]
97,4,1,Stan Marsh,Oh my God!
98,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,Four dollars?
99,4,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh, my God!)"
100,4,1,Eric Cartman,Do you what this means?
101,4,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. [he and Kyle grin]
102,4,1,A Dentist,[answering] Dentist office.
103,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman."
104,4,1,Dr Roberts,"Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?"
105,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried."
106,4,1,Dr Roberts,"Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?"
107,4,1,Liane Cartman,About a hundred and twelve.
108,4,1,Dr Roberts,...A hundred and twelve.
109,4,1,Liane Cartman,Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
110,4,1,Dr Roberts,"Your son wouldn't happen to be an ""alligator,"" would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it."
111,4,1,Liane Cartman,"O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week. [hangs up]"
112,4,1,Dr Roberts,What?
113,4,1,Eric Cartman,Tih- [the tooth he placed under his pillow is still there] Tooth? [picks it up and looks at it in disbelief] What the hell? Mom!
114,4,1,Liane Cartman,"[rushes in] Yes, Eric"
115,4,1,Eric Cartman,"You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!"
116,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down. [Cartman sits] Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month."
117,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[laughs] You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh... [mother and son sit silently for a while] M- Mom?"
118,4,1,Liane Cartman,"I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later."
119,4,1,Eric Cartman,Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
120,4,1,Liane Cartman,"No, honey. It's just-"
121,4,1,Eric Cartman,"How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?"
122,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child."
123,4,1,Eric Cartman,"How can I trust you? [hops off the bed] How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself. [tugs at his pajama shirt] Myself and Willikins Bear, of course."
124,4,1,Liane Cartman,"Eric! Eric, wait!"
125,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[covers his ears] No, Mother! No more lies! [runs out of his room and shuts the door]"
126,4,1,Stan Marsh,"[he and the others follow] Dude, where's the money?"
127,4,1,Eric Cartman,[flatly] There is no money.
128,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,No more money??
129,4,1,Stan Marsh,"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!"
130,4,1,Eric Cartman,I know!
131,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what's going on?!"
132,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[stops, then faces them sadly] You guys... [turns away] Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this."
133,4,1,Stan Marsh,Tell us what?!
134,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[faces them again] You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. [turns away again]"
135,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?"""
136,4,1,Eric Cartman,"My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money."
137,4,1,Stan Marsh,Dude.
138,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
139,4,1,Eric Cartman,"But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny. [Kenny approaches him and reaches out, but Cartman bushes him off] Don't touch me, Kenny. [Kenny steps back]"
140,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches] You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!"
141,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, open your eyes, man!"
142,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,It's not true! [runs away]
143,4,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[lowers his paper] Oh, hello, son. [Kyle turns to face him]"
144,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?"
145,4,1,Gerald Broflovski,"What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. [puts down his paper]"
146,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,[suddenly alarmed] Oh my God! You did lie to me.
147,4,1,Gerald Broflovski,"No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan."
148,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[looking aghast] Peter Pan, too??"
149,4,1,Gerald Broflovski,Kyle...
150,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,What about Moses and Abraham?
151,4,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, they were probably real."
152,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
153,4,1,Gerald Broflovski,Probably not.
154,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,[frightened] Wahahahah!
155,4,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children."
156,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! [runs out the door]"
157,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy."
158,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
159,4,1,Eric Cartman,"No, man, that's just a TV show."
160,4,1,Stan Marsh,[rushing up] You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
161,4,1,Eric Cartman,"What? That your parents lied to you, too?"
162,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!"
163,4,1,Eric Cartman,How?
164,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?"
165,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
166,4,1,Stan Marsh,"So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!"
167,4,1,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
168,4,1,Stan Marsh,The kid will never even know.
169,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!"
170,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, what if I'm not real?"
171,4,1,Stan Marsh,We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
172,4,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah. [leaves with Stan and Kenny]
173,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?"
174,4,1,Stan Marsh,"[returns] Come on, Kyle! [grabs him and pulls him along]"
175,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,What if this is all just somebody's dream?
176,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Wow, look at the size of these houses!"
177,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the [raises his hands to make quotes] ""Tooth Fairy."""
178,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, [points across the street] that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. [the boys head for a rambling ranch house. They skip the front door and head for the back]"
179,4,1,Stan Marsh,"[A window with stickers on it and a bush underneath is shown] There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it."
180,4,1,Eric Cartman,Got it. [Stan and the others lift Cartman up.]
181,4,1,Stan Marsh,"This is the smartest business venture ever. [Cartman is placed into position, but a blond kid swinging from another pole is lifted into position opposite him]"
182,4,1,Eric Cartman,What the-? [the camera peels back to show another group of kids on the other side of the bush]
183,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!"
184,4,1,Boy 1,"[with somewhat spiky hair] We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him."
185,4,1,Stan Marsh,"...Hey, you can't do that!"
186,4,1,Boy 2,[with cowlick] Why not?!
187,4,1,Stan Marsh,Because that's what we're doing!
188,4,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
189,4,1,Boy 2,What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
190,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,Two years?
191,4,1,Blond,Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
192,4,1,Eric Cartman,It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
193,4,1,Blond,How dare you! [he and Cartman start fighting in midair]
194,4,1,Boy 1,"Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!"
195,4,1,Stan Marsh,You scram! We were here first!
196,4,1,Rich kid,"[having heard the ruckus, opens the window] What's going on? [Cartman and the blond stop and look] Oh! It's the tooth fairies!"
197,4,1,Boy 2,"Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up! [the blond is lowered]"
198,4,1,Stan Marsh,You woke him up! [Cartman is lowered]
199,4,1,Rich kid,"I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy."
200,4,1,All,Shut up!
201,4,1,Boy 1,"Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!"
202,4,1,Stan Marsh,Who's the Boss?
203,4,1,Boy 1,Loogie.
204,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"[enjoying a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, he's dressed for business] My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?"
205,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Uuh, yeah."
206,4,1,Boy 1,"Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre- [Loogie raises his right palm] Erp."
207,4,1,Eric Cartman,We were there first!
208,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"[hops off his chair and walks to the portrait gallery] Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years. [points to each picture as he traces the line of succession] I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that."
209,4,1,Stan Marsh,Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
210,4,1,Loogie and his boys,Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
211,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, uh-what do you mean?"
212,4,1,Loogie and his boys,How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow? [the boys stay silent]
213,4,1,Boy 1,Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
214,4,1,Stan Marsh,"What's a ""tooth trade?"""
215,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved. [a street overlay showing kids at work in the neighborhood appears. A kid dispatcher sends them off] We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months. [the tooth fairy enters a window with another kid] Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see. [this other kid places the note on John's bedroom door: Dear Toothfairy, I lost a tooth! I put it under my pillow!] This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow. [the fairies ride through the neighborhood on their bikes] Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over, going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to do is collect money. [shots of the tooth fairies cleaning up] And the kids never know what hit 'em."
216,4,1,The South Park boys,Wow!
217,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries [Loogie's boys disinter a corpse and pull at its teeth], hockey games [two hockey players collide and one of them smacks the other one. A boy skates out and retrieves the loose tooth], anywhere we can find them [A beat-up boy is tied to a chair in a warehouse. The boy with the spiky hair is about to strike him with a mallet]"
218,4,1,Beat up Boy,Nooo! [the mallet heads for his...]
219,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality. [like gems, they are sent to conveyor belts to be sorted by lab technicians] But there's never enough teeth. Never enough."
220,4,1,Stan Marsh,Amazing.
221,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Man, that is tits!"
222,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"And now my only problem is, what do I do with you? [the boys are alarmed]"
223,4,1,Boy 1,Rowwr!
224,4,1,Loogie and his boys,Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
225,4,1,Stan Marsh,Oh. Uh-I don't know.
226,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"It's that, or else I can cut off your penises. [motions with his knife]"
227,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see..."
228,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
229,4,1,Stan Marsh,How much do we get if we work for you?
230,4,1,Loogie and his boys,I'll cut you in at 2%.
231,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Two percent, have my penis cut off. [Kyle gets mad at him] Two percent-"
232,4,1,Stan Marsh,We're in!
233,4,1,Dr Roberts,"Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. [presses a button to reveal a projection] A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel [shown sitting on a tree stump] that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest [the chicken-squirrel feeds its young] for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra [the chicken-squirrel tries to solve a basic problem], and that it-"
234,4,1,Dentist,"[stands] Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory."
235,4,1,Dr Roberts,"...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!"
236,4,1,Mr Foley,"I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit. [the rest of the doctors, including the ADA head, laugh at him]"
237,4,1,Dr Roberts,"Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds."
238,4,1,Mr Foley,It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
239,4,1,Dr Roberts,Where?!
240,4,1,Mr Foley,In Montreal. [the rest of the convention laughs louder]
241,4,1,Dr Roberts,"And where, pray, is this ""Montreal""?!"
242,4,1,Mr Foley,"[determined] Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!"
243,4,1,Dr Roberts,"Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand. [points at the chicken-squirrel]"
244,4,1,Mr Foley,"Well, I will! [leaves his seat and heads out the door]"
245,4,1,Dr Roberts,"[chuckles] Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device."
246,4,1,Beat-Up Boy,"[off-camera] Here! Here, over here, look! Look what I got- I got from the chef! [the main cafeteria doors fly open and in walk the foursome. Kenny is dressed in a baby-blue suit with hat and cane, Cartman wears a floor-length tiger-fur coat, Stan wears a formal blue suit, and Kyle wears a book- reads a book and wears a black suit. As they walk through the cafeteria kids turn and stare. Among them are Bebe, Butters, and Wendy. The boys enter the kitchen]"
247,4,1,Chef,"Hello there, children."
248,4,1,The Boys,"Hey, Chef."
249,4,1,Stan Marsh,We all want double-desserts today!
250,4,1,Chef,"Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that."
251,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. [tosses Chef a wad of bills]"
252,4,1,Chef,"[surprised, fumbles with the wad] Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!"
253,4,1,Eric Cartman,"That's right. Keep the change, my man."
254,4,1,Chef,"Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were- [realizes where this is headed] Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!"
255,4,1,The Boys,"That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called ""college."""
256,4,1,Chef,"That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. [A flashback to Chef's 8th year. He's walking down the street with his little girlfriend, a Hawaiian wearing a flower in her hair]"
257,4,1,Little Chef,"Ooo, come on, now."
258,4,1,Kid 1,"[all in blue] Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?"
259,4,1,Girl,What?
260,4,1,Kid 1,"Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?"
261,4,1,Little Chef,"Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song:
I can't wait until I grow up
and my weenie get big and strong
 'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust
And make love to you Amanda all night long
I'm gonna make love to y'Amanda in about ten years!"
262,4,1,Kid 3,[olive complexion] What?
263,4,1,Kid 2,[with the A shirt] What the hell is he talking about?
264,4,1,Little Chef,"[to Amanda, who's surprised] And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,..."
265,4,1,Stan Marsh,"U-uh, Chef."
266,4,1,Little Chef,"I'ma knock ya down, knock ya up,..."
267,4,1,Stan Marsh,Chef!
268,4,1,Little Chef,"...knock ya over, an' knock ya all around."
269,4,1,Stan Marsh,CHEF!
270,4,1,Chef,Uh?
271,4,1,Stan Marsh,We're not dealing drugs!
272,4,1,Chef,You're not?
273,4,1,Stan Marsh,No!
274,4,1,Chef,"Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but... [tries to find a moral] Ooh, uh-oh, never mind."
275,4,1,The Boys,"Thanks, Chef. [they leave]"
276,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,See ya.
277,4,1,Chef,"Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. [reaches under the counter for a phone and dials away]"
278,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!"
279,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?"
280,4,1,Stan Marsh,"We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses."
281,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!"
282,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[still reading] Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality."
283,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Sure, Kyle."
284,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground! [Mr. Foley enters; Loogie hangs up and does a falsetto] Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em."
285,4,1,Mr Foley,"Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association."
286,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti?"
287,4,1,Mr Foley,"[sits] No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you."
288,4,1,Loogie and his boys,I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
289,4,1,Mr Foley,"I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass! [having run out of things to say, he turns and walks out. Loogie resumes eating]"
290,4,1,Eric Cartman,"So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China."
291,4,1,Odd Boy,"[an anxious kid with oval head and big eyes] That's right, yeah [plops the bag on the desk] . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?"
292,4,1,Eric Cartman,[takes a scope out and analyzes a tooth] How much?
293,4,1,Odd Boy,"Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh? [smiles]"
294,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Can I ask you a question, Weasel?"
295,4,1,Weasel,"[the odd boy] Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure."
296,4,1,Eric Cartman,[rests his scope] Do you think I'm an idiot?
297,4,1,Weasel,Huh?
298,4,1,Eric Cartman,"These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?! [Weasel starts acting like a monkey. Kyle is seen reading another book] Get out of my sight! [Weasel hops off the chair and splits] Lousy little scum! [the phone rings] What?!"
299,4,1,Boy 2,"[on the phone. His mates have Kenny on a bridge railing, ready to dump him] This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!"
300,4,1,Eric Cartman,I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! [hangs up]
301,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one."
302,4,1,Boy 2,He's not gonna do it?!
303,4,1,Kenny McCormick,(He's not gonna do it?!) [looks over as Boy 2 places a call]
304,4,1,Boy 2,"He's not gonna do it, boss!"
305,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"Well then, throw him in. [Boy 2 gives the signal]"
306,4,1,Boy 1,"Alright, kid. Time to die. [he and his partner each grab a hold of an arm]"
307,4,1,Kenny McCormick,"(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!) [the two boys shove him off. Kenny lands in the river, but hits bottom before even getting wet. He looks down and attempts a few steps. The others look down from the bridge.]"
308,4,1,Boy 2,"Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?"
309,4,1,Anchor,"...to which Ms. Clinton replied, ""I don't even like Vagina."" Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live."
310,4,1,Field Reporter Dan Akawa,"[field reporter, next to a family] Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant [Billy strokes his nose] or he will most certainly die. [addresses the boy] Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant? [puts the mic in front of Billy]"
311,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,"[almost whispering] Sih, six hundred dollar-. [the reporter jerks the mic away]"
312,4,1,Field Reporter Dan Akawa,"Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!"
313,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,[trembling] Duh six hundred dohollars.
314,4,1,Field Reporter Dan Akawa,"Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?"
315,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,"Well, I a-I don't know."
316,4,1,Field Reporter Dan Akawa,"Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today."
317,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,Yehahah.
318,4,1,Field Reporter Dan Akawa,"Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy [points to Billy's parents and winks at the camera] is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!"
319,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,Really?
320,4,1,Mr Circlovich,Really?
321,4,1,Field Reporter Dan Akawa,"Yes, really. [hands Dad the money; he passes it to Mom. Billy grins] Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom. [print!] How was that?"
322,4,1,Mr Foley,[standing with two other dentists and the field crew]  Perfect. The trap is set.
323,4,1,Cameraman,"Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?"
324,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together! [leaves the tub] This is gonna be tits!"
325,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Stan] Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?"
326,4,1,Eric Cartman,[returns] Will somebody take those books away from him?
327,4,1,Mrs,"Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy."
328,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,"Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy."
329,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,"Okay-y, Mom. [turns and hops on the bed. Outside, a periscope rises from the van roof and looks around]"
330,4,1,Mr Foley,"[in the van, moves the viewer aside] Thank you for helping out, gentlemen. [walks up to the other dentists and a technician] If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?"
331,4,1,Dentists,Got it.
332,4,1,Murphy,"[the technician, acting dumb] Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss? [Foley isn't laughing, so Murphy chuckles] Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh."
333,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does."
334,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!"
335,4,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, just stop thinking about it."
336,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? [the boys pass the Platter River]"
337,4,1,Kenny McCormick,"[still in the river in the distance] (You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)"
338,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down, [(Heeyy!!)] and my own existence fading."
339,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,"[heard in the van] G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad."
340,4,1,Mr Foley,"Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled. [everyone suits up in riot gear. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle arrive at Billy's bedroom. Cartman is quickly hoisted up as Billy's parents come to kiss him]"
341,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,"I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?"
342,4,1,Mr Circlovich,"I think so, Billy. I think so."
343,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,"Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again."
344,4,1,Eric Cartman,"[thinking aloud] Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!"
345,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave. [Cartman opens the window and floats in grinning] Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! [begins to disappear]"
346,4,1,Stan Marsh,[noticing the silence] Kyle?
347,4,1,Murphy,Eh something strange is happening with the computers. [Stan looks at the space in which Kyle once stood]
348,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"[shows up with his mob] Well, well, well. What do we have here?"
349,4,1,Stan Marsh,"[notices] Aw, shit."
350,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski [Boy 1 steps forward], put this buttwipe out of his misery. [Kolovski reaches into his jacket]"
351,4,1,Eric Cartman,[retrieves the cash] I got it!
352,4,1,Billy Circlovich and his parents,[opens his eyes and rises] The tooth fairy! [the alarms go off.]
353,4,1,Mr Foley,Let's move out! [exits the van with the other dentists]
354,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"Aw, drat! [the dentists close in]"
355,4,1,Mr Foley,"Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists."
356,4,1,Loogie and his boys,It was a trap!
357,4,1,Mr Foley,That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison! [the other dentists move in closer]
358,4,1,A voice,"This is reality! I am everywhere [Kyle's head, undulating, appears], and nowhere."
359,4,1,Mr Foley,What the hell?
360,4,1,Eric Cartman,Kyle?
361,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I am nothing, and everything."
362,4,1,Dr Roberts,"Well, I told you! [the chicken-squirrel goes after the dentists, and the kids disperse]"
363,4,1,Mr Foley,"Let's get outta here! [leaves with his group. Everyone scatters. Stan, Cartman, and Loogie remain in the backyard, and Billy grins with the $600 back in his hands. Kyle reappears in front of them]"
364,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,Hunh. That was pretty weird.
365,4,1,Loogie and his boys,Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along! [Billy drops from his bed and walks away] How could I be so stupid?!
366,4,1,Stan Marsh,What?
367,4,1,Loogie and his boys,I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
368,4,1,Eric Cartman,"Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face."
369,4,1,Loogie and his boys,Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen.
370,4,1,Stan Marsh,Really?
371,4,1,Loogie and his boys,Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways.
372,4,1,Stan Marsh,So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
373,4,1,Loogie and his boys,"Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with."
374,4,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us."
375,4,1,Eric Cartman,...Tits.
376,4,1,Timmy Burch,[zipping by on the road above] Timmy!
377,4,2,Butters Stotch,Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
378,4,2,Sledders,[three teams of four boys apiece] Ready!
379,4,2,Butters Stotch,"On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! [the teams head down the small hill, and Cartman's team finishes first]"
380,4,2,Stan Marsh,We win again! [all get off their sleds]
381,4,2,Token Black,That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
382,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!"
383,4,2,Lizzy,"We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!"
384,4,2,Stan Marsh,Sleds are for guys.
385,4,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
386,4,2,Lizzy,"These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!"
387,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else."
388,4,2,The rest of the boys,Yeah!
389,4,2,Lizzy,"I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!"
390,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh yeah?!
391,4,2,The Girls,Yeah!
392,4,2,Eric Cartman,We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
393,4,2,Lizzy,"How about a race down a real hill, then?!"
394,4,2,The Girls,Yeah!
395,4,2,Stan Marsh,You got it!
396,4,2,The rest of the boys,Yeah!
397,4,2,A few others,Yeah!
398,4,2,Lizzy,Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
399,4,2,Stan Marsh,Noo problem!
400,4,2,Lizzy,Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
401,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
402,4,2,Lizzy,"See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!"
403,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, boy! We'll show them!"
404,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!"
405,4,2,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are."
406,4,2,Token Black,"Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!"
407,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time [walks to a rock and picks it up] I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! [Kyle draws near to Token]"
408,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Fatass.
409,4,2,Eric Cartman,There! [chucks the rock and it knocks Token down]
410,4,2,Token Black,Oh! [falls face first into the snow. Kyle is stunned that Cartman followed through]
411,4,2,Eric Cartman,[sees what he's done] Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
412,4,2,Mr Mackey,"And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?"
413,4,2,Liane Cartman,"Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?"
414,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Mom."
415,4,2,Liane Cartman,"Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!"
416,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Token."
417,4,2,Mr Mackey,"Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric."
418,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? [drops from his chair] The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. [turns and heads for the door] See ya later."
419,4,2,Mr Mackey,"[raises his index finger] Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!"
420,4,2,Eric Cartman,No way!
421,4,2,Mr Mackey,"Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- [the door opens and two suits enter]"
422,4,2,Man 1,Counselor Mackey?
423,4,2,Mr Mackey,Yes?
424,4,2,Man 1,I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with [with gravity] the FBI.
425,4,2,Agent Keen,We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.
426,4,2,Mr Mackey,"Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention."
427,4,2,Agent Sharp,"I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered [close-up] a hate crime."
428,4,2,Eric Cartman,...What the hell is a hate crime?
429,4,2,Mr Mackey,"Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-"
430,4,2,Agent Keen,"New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense."
431,4,2,Eric Cartman,What? A federal offense?
432,4,2,Mr Mackey,Oh no.
433,4,2,Eric Cartman,Oh no??
434,4,2,Agent Keen,"We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol. [grabs a hold of Cartman] Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in a federal court of law. [the two agents walk out with Cartman]"
435,4,2,Liane Cartman,Oh my goodness.
436,4,2,Announcer,"The hate crime trial of the century is underway [Cartman is shown] on Court TV tracks U van. [Token is shown]. Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith."
437,4,2,"Leslie Smith, Trial TV host","What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom [the courthouse is shown] as the defendant takes the stand."
438,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of ""Token?"""
439,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Uh, yes?"
440,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,Who is Token?
441,4,2,Eric Cartman,He's a black kid that goes to my school?
442,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,Black! [gets animated] Did you say black?! You called him black?!
443,4,2,Eric Cartman,He is black.
444,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"O! He said it again! [the audience gasps] He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!"
445,4,2,Eric Cartman,I did?
446,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
447,4,2,Eric Cartman,No! I hate hippies!
448,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,What?!
449,4,2,Eric Cartman,"I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!"
450,4,2,Liane Cartman,"[behind the defense area] Oo, poopiekins?"
451,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This ""monster"" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!"
452,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[off camera] Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!"
453,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,[faces the audience and judge] The prosecution rests.
454,4,2,Lizzy,"[walks in with Bebe, stops next to Stan and Kyle] Don't forget: we still have a sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters. [turns around and walks away]"
455,4,2,Stan Marsh,We know!
456,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,We know!
457,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice."
458,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one."
459,4,2,Eric Cartman,No!
460,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are! [Cartman stares blankly back at the Judge, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Court is adjourned! [gavels one last time.]"
461,4,2,The Girls,"[Bebe, Lizzy, and Red jump for joy.] Woohoo! Hooray!"
462,4,2,Prosecutor and Honorable Judge,"Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall."
463,4,2,Black Bailiff,"Yes, sir. [they turn to face Cartman]"
464,4,2,White Bailiff,"Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go? [Cartman has disappeared, leaving a fallen chair behind]"
465,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[jumping excitedly] Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!"
466,4,2,Kenny McCormick,(What the fuck for?!)
467,4,2,Eric Cartman,They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
468,4,2,Kenny McCormick,(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
469,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[slaps Kenny] Calm down, Kenny!"
470,4,2,Kenny McCormick,(Hey!)
471,4,2,Eric Cartman,Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
472,4,2,Kenny McCormick,(Yes)
473,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, come on! I don't have much time! [heads for the garage. Outside, the garage door opens and a tiny truck creaks out with Kenny at the wheel and Cartman in the back seat]"
474,4,2,Anchor Tom,A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?
475,4,2,Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins,"[""NEWS 4 LIVE!""] Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him [in a single line, creeping] but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway. [Kenny takes a transition road off to his right] Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about."
476,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!"
477,4,2,Kenny McCormick,[looks back] (Why don'tcha keep your head down?!) [Cartman ducks]
478,4,2,Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins,"Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading. [they have also enlisted the fire department's help] This could be the final stand-off."
479,4,2,Policeman 1,"[holds his hand up for a halt] Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up. [the Bronco keeps going] Just bring it to a stop and come on out. [the Bronco keeps going] Jeezus, he's gonna ram it! [the officers dive for cover and Kenny pushes into the two cars blocking his way. Slowly, tons of steel give way before the puny Bronco, and Kenny and Cartman break through the blockade. The Bronco leaves and the officers get up.] Crazy son of a bitch."
480,4,2,Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins,"Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended. [eight cars are shown in four rows of two following the little Go-Go Action Bronco.]"
481,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are they doing?
482,4,2,Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins,The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
483,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?"
484,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. [the camera zooms out to show two lines of police cars following closely behind Kenny and Cartman. At least 22 cars are shown]"
485,4,2,Eric Cartman,"We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico! [the little Bronco crawls to a dead stop.] Oh, God dammit! [the police cars rush in and the first one bumps the Bronco down the road. The others run into the first one and pile on. A few cars fly over and crash]"
486,4,2,Stan Marsh,[answers] Hello?
487,4,2,Lizzy,"Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!"
488,4,2,Stan Marsh,Son of a bitch!
489,4,2,Driver,"Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall."
490,4,2,Prison Guards and Warden,"Prisoner 24601, arriving. [Cartman enters holding some bedding] Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500. [leads him in] Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband. [they pass through a security door into the mess hall] At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper! [the other kids look up and gasp]"
491,4,2,Eric Cartman,Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
492,4,2,Romper Stomper,"[steps into the aisle] I am! [His feet are shown with yellow pails underneath them. Cartman turns, and a menacing kid with a teardrop tattoo under the left eye looks back at him] And I don't want no new cellmate!"
493,4,2,Prison Guards and Warden,"[Cartman hides behind him] You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!"
494,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Oh, I will! [steps forward on his pails] You bet your ass I will."
495,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday."
496,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. [The others look around at each other]"
497,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?"
498,4,2,Butters Stotch,"...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid."
499,4,2,Clyde Donovan,Huh?
500,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde."
501,4,2,Clyde Donovan,I'm not fat.
502,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid."
503,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!"
504,4,2,Clyde Donovan,"[sits on the back end of the sled] Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned."
505,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! [he, Kyle, and Kenny push off and then hop on as the sled picks up speed. The rest of the kids cheer them on]"
506,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[as the sled stops] Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move."
507,4,2,Lizzy,"[her team's sled passes the boys by] See you Saturday, poo sniffers!"
508,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[looks back at Clyde] Nice going, fat boy!"
509,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!"
510,4,2,Inmates,Yeah!
511,4,2,Eric Cartman,Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
512,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!"
513,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?"
514,4,2,Romper Stomper,[after some thought] ...Neither do we
515,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[softly] Oh, thank you, Jesus. [normally] So we're friends now?"
516,4,2,Romper Stomper,"No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in ""friends."""
517,4,2,Inmates,Yeah!
518,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck."
519,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here."
520,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks [points to them], but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!"
521,4,2,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, that's a wonderful idea."
522,4,2,Clyde Donovan,So I don't get to be on the team now?
523,4,2,All the boys,"Shut up, fatass!"
524,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! [Clyde glares back]"
525,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's get it a try. [he and Kyle get on, and Kenny starts the sled and gets on,]"
526,4,2,Kenny McCormick,Woopee!
527,4,2,Stan Marsh,Woopee!
528,4,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah-
529,4,2,Stan Marsh,Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]
530,4,2,Kenny McCormick,Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]
531,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]
532,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Dude, bail! Bail! [they jump off, leaving Kenny with the brick rider. They end up face down]"
533,4,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Huh? Uh.) [the sled hits a rock, tossing him through the air] (AAAAAA!) [slams into a tree and sticks] (Ufff!) [the brick rider slams into him, killing him] (Ugh!)"
534,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[looks up] Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny."
535,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,We killed Kenny?
536,4,2,Stan Marsh,We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. [they walk up to the tree and stand in front of the puddle of blood]
537,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?"
538,4,2,Stan Marsh,Nothing else is gonna work. [the rest of the boys converge on the tree] We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
539,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!"
540,4,2,Pip Pirrup,This is a sad day for men everywhere.
541,4,2,Stan Marsh,"You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted."
542,4,2,All the boys,Yeup.
543,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
544,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was."
545,4,2,Lizzy,"[arrives and steps off the sled] Woohoo. Great time, girls. [notices Kenny flattened against the tree] Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers! [walks away with her sled and the three other girls]"
546,4,2,Stan Marsh,That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
547,4,2,Some boys,Oh?
548,4,2,Other boys,[simultaneous] Huh?
549,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,How?
550,4,2,Stan Marsh,I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
551,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Sweet! Let's go!
552,4,2,The group,Hooray! Alright! Here we go!
553,4,2,Mother 1,And have you been brushing your teeth?
554,4,2,Boy 1,"Yes, Mommy."
555,4,2,Mother 1,And not dropping your soap?
556,4,2,Boy 1,"Yes, Mommy."
557,4,2,Boy 2,"Hi, Mom."
558,4,2,Mother 2,"Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded."
559,4,2,Boy 2,"Grounded? On, no! Um, wait... [Cartman has no visitors yet]"
560,4,2,Guard,"[leads Kyle and Stan to Cartman] Here you go, boys. Keep it short."
561,4,2,Eric Cartman,Hey you guys.
562,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[he and Stan take their seats] Hey, fatass. How's prison?"
563,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?"
564,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!"
565,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. [lowers his voice] So we made you this cake. [lifts it onto the counter, and it reads, ""Get Out Soon, Cartman""] There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it."
566,4,2,Eric Cartman,A what?
567,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] An ailnay ilefay.
568,4,2,Eric Cartman,Wwhat's that?
569,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!"
570,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you stupid umbassday!"
571,4,2,Eric Cartman,"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here"
572,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"They on'tday?! [takes the cake down] Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!"
573,4,2,Stan Marsh,...Yeah.
574,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[a guard walks past him] Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?"
575,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-"
576,4,2,Eric Cartman,Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
577,4,2,Stan Marsh,Sshh! [the guard looks over]
578,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, [hushed] then I need those cigarettes."
579,4,2,Stan Marsh,How are we supposed to give them to you?
580,4,2,Eric Cartman,Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
581,4,2,Stan Marsh,But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
582,4,2,Eric Cartman,"I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. [Stan and Kyle look at him and bust out laughing] Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!"
583,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, here. [pulls some out and slips them through the holes one by one. The guard checks his watch and Cartman packs his ass]"
584,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, okay... here... l'see..."
585,4,2,Stan Marsh,Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
586,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
587,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. [leaves the visiting area]"
588,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. [he and Stan laugh]
589,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[at the door] Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. [the guard opens the door and Cartman walks in]"
590,4,2,Stan Marsh,That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. [pulls it out]
591,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,So now what do we do?
592,4,2,Stan Marsh,"There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!"
593,4,2,Romper Stomper,"[reading a book, looks up] Well, did you get the cigarettes?"
594,4,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
595,4,2,Romper Stomper,Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. [Cartman does as told and starts groaning]
596,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. [groans some more until a plop is heard] One. [groans and screams until a second plop is heard] Heh, two. [more groans] Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh [plop] yeahhh. Hoh. Phew. [flushes the toilet and Romper looks up horrified] Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! [walks back to Romper crestfallen]"
597,4,2,Romper Stomper,You flushed them?!
598,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here."
599,4,2,Romper Stomper,"No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me."
600,4,2,Eric Cartman,Son of a bitch!
601,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away."
602,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity."
603,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
604,4,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah. [they walk up to the front door of a nice house. Kyle rings the bell]
605,4,2,Linda Black,[answering] Hello?
606,4,2,Stan Marsh,Hi. Can Token come out and play?
607,4,2,Linda Black,"Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like. [the boys enter]"
608,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Killer.
609,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[sees Token] Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?"
610,4,2,Token Black,No.
611,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well then, [Token begins to move away. Kyle holds his shoulder, but moves with him. Stan follows] you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!"
612,4,2,Token Black,Yeah.
613,4,2,Steve Black,"I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys."
614,4,2,Stan Marsh,It's not?
615,4,2,Steve Black,"No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor."
616,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit! [remembers where he is] Oh, sorry."
617,4,2,Steve Black,"No, I'd, actually agree with you."
618,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
619,4,2,Steve Black,"Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind."
620,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?"
621,4,2,Steve Black,"Oh, he wouldn't listen to me."
622,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Why not?
623,4,2,Steve Black,Because I'm black.
624,4,2,Stan Marsh,Oh.
625,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh.
626,4,2,Steve Black,"Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws. [leads them away]"
627,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[moans and tries until a small splash is heard] Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. [walks in with a box and tosses it on the ground] Here you go, God-damnit!"
628,4,2,Romper Stomper,"[tosses his book away and stands up] Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. [picks it up] Ew, it smells, man."
629,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!"
630,4,2,Romper Stomper,"You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!"
631,4,2,Eric Cartman,But you said-
632,4,2,Romper Stomper,I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
633,4,2,Eric Cartman,I thought that-
634,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house. [walks to the cell door] Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw [Cartman, forsaken, begins to cry] Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess. [turns to Cartman] Hey. Uh, what are you doing? [Cartman cries some more] You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!"
635,4,2,Eric Cartman,I want my Mo-omm [cries some more and rubs his eyes]
636,4,2,Romper Stomper,Dude. [walks up to Cartman]
637,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Mommy, I want my Mommy! [continues crying]"
638,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here."
639,4,2,Eric Cartman,You will?
640,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland."
641,4,2,Colorado Governor's Aide,"Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?"
642,4,2,Colorado Governor,"Naw, not another committee. Send them in. [Stan, Kyle, and Token enter. Kyle carries a boombox and Token an easel with their presentation on it. They set up] This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?"
643,4,2,Token Black,Yeah.
644,4,2,Colorado Governor,"Well, boys, what can I do for you?"
645,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Okay, go ahead and start."
646,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't start, you start."
647,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uhyeah. [walks to the easel and clears his throat] Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."" [shows the title page. Kyle presses the play button for some ambiance] Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws."
648,4,2,Token Black,"[flips a page to depict a stabbing in progress] If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime."
649,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"And we think that that is [flips the page to reveal a copy of the title page] a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?"
650,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[flips the page to reveal a person tagging City Hall] If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?"
651,4,2,Token Black,[flips the page to reveal a man being hit deliberately by a car] And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
652,4,2,Stan Marsh,"[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark] Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same."
653,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[shows a rainbow of people holding hands] But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes [Stan flips the page to reveal their hate crime proposal]. For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we [flips the page to show them winning a sledding race] will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday."
654,4,2,Stan Marsh,That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
655,4,2,Token Black,"[flips the page to reveal another copy of the title page] ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy."" [Kyle turns the tape player off]"
656,4,2,Colorado Governor,Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
657,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us! [Cartman runs ahead, Romper trips on a rock] Mph. Oowww!"
658,4,2,Eric Cartman,[turns around] What's the matter?
659,4,2,Romper Stomper,[looks up] It's my leg! I think it's broken. [looks back] You go on ahead without me.
660,4,2,Eric Cartman,Uhokay. [turns and runs]
661,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Hey. [Cartman stops and turns] You're supposed to say, ""I'm not going without you,"" or something."
662,4,2,Eric Cartman,Oh. Really?
663,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends."
664,4,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
665,4,2,Romper Stomper,I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. [offers his pails]
666,4,2,Eric Cartman,Okay. [retrieves them]
667,4,2,Romper Stomper,"No! You're supposed to say, ""I can't take these,"" or something, dumbass!"
668,4,2,Eric Cartman,Oh. I can't take these. [offers them back]
669,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Take them. They'll bring you luck. [looks back again] Now go on. Get out of here. [Cartman turns, walks some, and returns]"
670,4,2,Eric Cartman,Romper?
671,4,2,Romper Stomper,Yeah?
672,4,2,Eric Cartman,"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me."
673,4,2,Guard,"[shows up with other guards] Alright, freeze! [Cartman steps to Romper's side]"
674,4,2,Eric Cartman,"You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!"
675,4,2,Guard,But you've been pardoned by the governor! [shows the document]
676,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[takes it] O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. [walks away]"
677,4,2,Lizzy,"[at the front of the girls' sled] Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!"
678,4,2,Stan Marsh,Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
679,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
680,4,2,Lizzy,"Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!"
681,4,2,Bebe Stevens,"Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!"
682,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him."
683,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Alright, where's Clyde."
684,4,2,Clyde Donovan,[steps up] Right here.
685,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!"
686,4,2,Clyde Donovan,"For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! [realizes he's responded as Cartman would, and covers his mouth with both hands]"
687,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"On the sled, fatass!"
688,4,2,Lizzy,"Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!"
689,4,2,Other girls,Yeah!
690,4,2,Butters Stotch,"[steps into place with the starting flags] Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-"
691,4,2,Eric Cartman,[Butters looks up] You guys! [runs over a hill into view and races towards the group]
692,4,2,Stan Marsh,It's Cartman!
693,4,2,Boy Sledders,Hooray!
694,4,2,Eric Cartman,"That's right! I'm back! [Clyde walks over and hugs him, and he is surprised]"
695,4,2,Clyde Donovan,"Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back! [relief creeps in] Thank you so much. Thank you."
696,4,2,Eric Cartman,What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
697,4,2,Lizzy,This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
698,4,2,Stan Marsh,All right! Let's do this!
699,4,2,Butters Stotch,Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
700,4,2,Eric Cartman,I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
701,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh-get set. Go! [lowers the flags, and the girls shove off]"
702,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside."
703,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, fatass!"
704,4,2,Eric Cartman,"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-"
705,4,2,Token Black,"Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]"
706,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]"
707,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]"
708,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! [the camera looks at the slope. The girls come down first, then the boys]"
709,4,2,Lizzy,"We've got' em, girls!"
710,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
711,4,2,Kids at Finish Line,Go! You can do it! Come on!
712,4,2,Stan Marsh,"We're not gonna make it! [Cartman thinks, then he remembers.]"
713,4,2,Eric Cartman,Hey. [pulls out the pails and tosses them at the girls' sled]
714,4,2,Lizzy,"G'aaaaah! [the pails gum up the reins. The girls' sled veers off the run and over a cliff. The weightlessness causes the girls and sled to separate, and all fall scattered on the ground below. A brown bear comes up]"
715,4,2,Bear,Rowr. {carries Lizzy away]
716,4,2,Boy Sledders,[crossing the finish line] Hooray!
717,4,2,Stan Marsh,We did it!
718,4,2,Girls,"Awww. [walk away disappointed, leaving only one blonde carrying a sign: GIRLS RULE]"
719,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,We won! We won!
720,4,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!"
721,4,2,Boys,Hooray!
722,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,"It's good to have you back, Cartman."
723,4,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again."
724,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again."
725,4,2,Pip Pirrup,"Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass! [no one does. Cartman picks up a rock and throws it at him] Oh-ff. [falls on his face. The rock lands next to Cartman]"
726,4,2,Eric Cartman,Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
727,4,2,Stan Marsh,Naah.
728,4,2,Kyle Broflovski,Naah.
729,4,2,Butters Stotch,Naah.
730,4,2,Token Black,Naah.
731,4,2,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
732,4,2,Guard,Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up! [Romper gets up] You got a visitor! [rolls the door aside and Cartman enters]
733,4,2,Romper Stomper,Eric!
734,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey, Romper Stomper."
735,4,2,Romper Stomper,Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
736,4,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too."
737,4,2,Romper Stomper,"You did? [Cartman goes to the door to make sure the guards are gone, then returns to Stomper]"
738,4,2,Eric Cartman,You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
739,4,2,Romper Stomper,Yeah. [Cartman walks off to the toilet]
740,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[begins grunting. A few moments later, and a grin breaks out on Stomper's face. A big splash follows] Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh."
741,4,2,Romper Stomper,Whoa! [end credits roll]
742,4,2,Eric Cartman,Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. [splash. Romper is stunned] Ogh! Wait-
743,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Oh, yeah!"
744,4,2,Eric Cartman,"[grunts some more] Uh, what else? [splash] Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! [grunts some more, then, splash]"
745,4,2,Romper Stomper,"Oh, the monorail!"
746,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, did you do all your homework last night?"
747,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
748,4,3,Stan Marsh,I know!
749,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together? [the class sits silently] Let's see, how about..."
750,4,3,Eric Cartman,"[praying softly at his desk] Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me."
751,4,3,Mr Garrison,Wendy?
752,4,3,Eric Cartman,Phew!
753,4,3,Wendy Testaburger,1776.
754,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?"
755,4,3,Eric Cartman,"[praying] Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-"
756,4,3,Mr Garrison,[points to] Kyle?
757,4,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!"
758,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,The Declaration of Independence?
759,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence? [Cartman drops low in his seat so as to hide behind Butters, seated in front of him] Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy? [the camera and the class's eyes move to Timmy, who's grinning]"
760,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
761,4,3,Mr Garrison,"No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again."
762,4,3,Timmy Burch,Heh-aaaaaah!
763,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Timmy, did you not do your homework?!"
764,4,3,Timmy Burch,Erh Timmiihh!!
765,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded."
766,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Don't call people names, Stanley!"
767,4,3,Stan Marsh,But he is-
768,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, Timmy,—"
769,4,3,Timmy Burch,Haaaaah.
770,4,3,Mr Garrison,—You need to work on your study skills!
771,4,3,Timmy Burch,Doo-uhh.
772,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!"
773,4,3,Timmy Burch,"G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!"
774,4,3,Mr Garrison,THAT DOES IT!
775,4,3,Principal Victoria,"Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention."
776,4,3,Timmy Burch,Heh-aaaaaah!
777,4,3,Mr Mackey,"Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!"
778,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
779,4,3,Principal Victoria,"Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! [pulls out a suspension form and starts filling it out]"
780,4,3,Timmy Burch,Ehhha-a-a-ah.
781,4,3,Mr Mackey,"Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria. [she stops writing] I think I may know what the problem is. [walks to Timmy and stands behind him, checking him out ]"
782,4,3,Timmy Burch,[softly] Timmiihh.
783,4,3,Mr Mackey,"Yes, of course."
784,4,3,Principal Victoria,What??
785,4,3,Mr Mackey,"[Timmy is grinning, enjoying himself] I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, ""Attention Deficit Disorder,"" or ADD. It's very common in kids his age."
786,4,3,Principal Victoria,Oh!
787,4,3,Timmy Burch,[turns right and zooms away] Timmiihh!
788,4,3,Principal Victoria,"Well, that certainly would explain it."
789,4,3,Mr Mackey,"It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?"
790,4,3,Timmy Burch,"[zooms across the room in the other direction] Oolih oo livin' a lie, Timmehuh!"
791,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder."
792,4,3,Principal Victoria,Good.
793,4,3,Mr Mackey,M'kay.
794,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
795,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, ""The Great Gatsby,"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?"
796,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
797,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"[sits] Okay, here we go. [opens the book and clear his throat] ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since"" [""since since since since..."" The clock reads 2:01, but the hours begin to roll by: 3:24, 5:55, 9:09...] ""so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" [closes the book. Both Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria are asleep, his head resting on hers.]"
798,4,3,Timmy Burch,Ha-a-a-a-a-h.
799,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?"
800,4,3,Timmy Burch,"[fiddles around some, then turns aside] Timmih!"
801,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"[rises and slams the book on the floor] Well, that settles it!"
802,4,3,Mr Mackey,[sit up] Huh??
803,4,3,Principal Victoria,[sit up] Huh??
804,4,3,Clinic Doctor,This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!
805,4,3,Mr Mackey,"[rubs his eyes] Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it."
806,4,3,Principal Victoria,"What can we do for him, doctor?"
807,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy."
808,4,3,Timmy Burch,[softly] Timmih.
809,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Hurry up, children, let's take our seats. [Timmy rolls up with a note attached to his head] You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy. [sees the note] What's this? [peels it off and reads it]"
810,4,3,Timmy Burch,Tim-mih.
811,4,3,Mr Garrison,"A note from the principal? ""Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder."" [puts the note down] Oh, brother!"
812,4,3,Stan Marsh,He doesn't have to do homework?
813,4,3,Mr Garrison,"That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!"
814,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
815,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Very well, I guess you're excused from homework."
816,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
817,4,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, me too."
818,4,3,Stan Marsh,I've got ADD.
819,4,3,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
820,4,3,Other classmates,"Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah. It's gay."
821,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"""After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain."" [sighs and closes the book. Kenny bangs his head against the wall cabinet. Tweek, Kyle, and Bebe sleep where they sit. Cartman is asleep on his back. Token, Stan, Wendy, Clyde, and Kevin are drowsy.] Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about? [Kenny bangs head head again] Anybody? [Kenny bangs head head again] Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD! [scribbles onto his notepad quickly]"
822,4,3,All the kids,[sleepily] Hooray.
823,4,3,Eric Cartman,[sleepily] Hoo-ray.
824,4,3,Clinic Doctor,It's Ritalin for all of you! [writes out prescriptions]
825,4,3,Drummer,"Dude, we suck!"
826,4,3,Skyler,"Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!"
827,4,3,Jonesy,"Dude, we never win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal."
828,4,3,Skyler,"[disbelieving] Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!"
829,4,3,"Lords of the Underworld
 Skyler
 Jonesy
 Mark","Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting."
830,4,3,Skyler,We've just gotta practice more.
831,4,3,Jonesy,"Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler."
832,4,3,Skyler,"Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top! [the band starts up again, then pause]"
833,4,3,Timmy Burch,[outside] Timmuuhh! [the band riffs] Coodalah Timmuh!
834,4,3,Jonesy,[stops] What was that?
835,4,3,Skyler,"Huh-I don't know, man. [picks up the garage door opener and presses the button. The door rises to the sound of an angelic choir and orchestra and reveals the bright light outside. And in that light is Timmy.] Whoaaa!"
836,4,3,"Lords of the Underworld
 Skyler
 Jonesy
 Mark",Who is that?
837,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
838,4,3,Skyler,"You a singer, man?"
839,4,3,Timmy Burch,"Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah! [no reaction, but later, the band practices again. Timmy is with them now.] Timmehuh! [the band plays on, then stops] Timmehh."
840,4,3,Jonesy,"Dude, that's hot!"
841,4,3,Skyler,Yeah!
842,4,3,Pharmacist,"There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin."
843,4,3,Mrs McCormick,And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
844,4,3,Pharmacist,"We can only hope so. Next? [the camera pulls back to show a line of kids with their moms. Kenny and his mom leave, and Stan arrives with his mom]"
845,4,3,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, hi, Sheila."
846,4,3,Sheila Broflovski,"Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?"
847,4,3,Sharon Marsh,Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
848,4,3,Sheila Broflovski,"I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old."
849,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,...I am eight.
850,4,3,Pharmacist,"Next, please? [Liane hands him the prescription] What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin!"
851,4,3,Liane Cartman,Yes.
852,4,3,Eric Cartman,That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
853,4,3,Liane Cartman,"Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?"
854,4,3,Pharmacist,"Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all."
855,4,3,Liane Cartman,Alright.
856,4,3,Pharmacist,"Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected."
857,4,3,Liane Cartman,Oh my.
858,4,3,Band,"Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light."
859,4,3,People in Audience,Boooo!
860,4,3,Guy in flat top,You suck! [others laugh. The band clears out as the M.C. approaches the mic]
861,4,3,M C,"Alright, that was ""Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord,"" with their song, ""Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)"""
862,4,3,Singer,We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.
863,4,3,M C,And now it's time for our final band.
864,4,3,Guy in Audience,Thank God! [others laugh]
865,4,3,M C,"Give it up for ""Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!"" [the curtains part amid a smattering of applause to reveal the Lords of the Underworld and Timmy rolls up to the mic. The audience is stunned]"
866,4,3,Skyler,1 2 3 4 [the Lords launch into their song]
867,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [a riff] Timmih! Lehmeheuh! [confused looks on people's faces] Timmih!
868,4,3,Man 1,"Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!"
869,4,3,Man 2,Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!
870,4,3,Man 3,You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?!
871,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmih Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!
872,4,3,The Lords,Lords of the Underworld.
873,4,3,Timmy Burch,"Timmih, Timmiih!"
874,4,3,The Lords,Darkness fills my heart with pain.
875,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmih oo livin' a lie! [the four boys arrive]
876,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's Timmy."
877,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,No way! [Timmy says something incomprehensible]
878,4,3,Man 3,"They're ridiculing that singer! [""habah kulaa!""]Come on, let's get outta here! [leaves with three others]"
879,4,3,Timmy Burch,Sibilah Sibinlaahh! [keeps babbling]
880,4,3,The Lords,The Lords of the Underworld.
881,4,3,Timmy Burch,"Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!"
882,4,3,The Lords,Darkness fills my heart with pain. [the song ends. Someone is carried across the field by the crowd]
883,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh. [one last power chord] Timmeh!
884,4,3,Eric Cartman,That was awesuhome!
885,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Timmy ruhules!"
886,4,3,Woman,Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
887,4,3,Stan Marsh,But he's funny.
888,4,3,Woman,How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
889,4,3,Timmy Burch,[basking in the applause] Hehaahh!
890,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,He looks pretty happy to me.
891,4,3,Woman,"Oh, you people make me sick! [walks away]"
892,4,3,M C,"Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!"
893,4,3,Crowd,[roars in approval] Wooo!
894,4,3,Jonesy,"[flexes his arms] We did it, dude!"
895,4,3,Skyler,[moves forward] Listen to them. They really love me. [bows] Wooo!!
896,4,3,Crowd,[responds] Wooo!!
897,4,3,Skyler,Yes! I'm a rocker! [he and Jonesy throw their arms up in victory]
898,4,3,Charlie Rose,"Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo [a clip of it at the Battle of the Bands], the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm. [the crowd cheers and holds up ""TIMMY"" signs. A woman lifts up her blouse to reveal her bra] Already playing at several large venues this month [the band is shown coming off a plane. Cameras flash at Timmy with the Lords of the Underworld behind him], the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy."
899,4,3,Phil Collins,"[in the middle of a street holding his Oscar] Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities!"
900,4,3,Man,[appears in the background and points at Phil] Hah haha.
901,4,3,Phil Collins,Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
902,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?"
903,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is."
904,4,3,Eric Cartman,"[arrives with Kenny and speaks mellowly] Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?"
905,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff."
906,4,3,Eric Cartman,"No, dude, you gotta try it. [hands a bottle to Kyle] It makes you feel good."
907,4,3,Kenny McCormick,"[also mellow] (Good.) [Kyle takes a couple of pills, then tosses the bottle to Stan]"
908,4,3,Chef,"Hello there, children."
909,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Hello, Chef."
910,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello, Chef."
911,4,3,Eric Cartman,"Hello, Chef."
912,4,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hello, Chef.)"
913,4,3,Chef,How's it goin'?
914,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Very well, thank you."
915,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Very well, thank you."
916,4,3,Eric Cartman,"Very well, thank you."
917,4,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Very well, thank you.)"
918,4,3,Chef,[incredulous] Everything's fine?? Why??
919,4,3,Stan Marsh,Because we're on Ritalin.
920,4,3,Chef,What??
921,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
922,4,3,Eric Cartman,"It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. [shakes two pills out of his bottle and swallows them]"
923,4,3,Chef,So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
924,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"That's correct, Chef."
925,4,3,Chef,"Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!"
926,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium"
927,4,3,Stan Marsh,Oh boy oh boy.
928,4,3,Kenny McCormick,(Oh boy.)
929,4,3,Chef,"Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects."
930,4,3,Stan Marsh,"But there are no side effects, Chef."
931,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No, not at all. [Cartman looks away and a Christina Aguilera monster appears]"
932,4,3,Christina Aguilera monster,"Rown! [Cartman rubs his eyes, and she's gone]"
933,4,3,Eric Cartman,Did you guys see that?
934,4,3,Stan Marsh,See what?
935,4,3,Announcer,"You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder."
936,4,3,Kurt Loder,"[framed by seven monitors showing the following: the MTV logo, The Cure's Robert Smith, a rotating Earth, Ozzy Osbourne, KoRn, Elton John, and Rick James] Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years."
937,4,3,Announcer,"[the logo takes up the whole screen] Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No way, he did just say it, but just to be cool. That's what makes him cool. You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now, the news that's cool."
938,4,3,Kurt Loder,"Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy [a shot of him], the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins."
939,4,3,Phil Collins,"[now in South Park with his Oscar] Well, I think the sad question is, ""Where are the parents in all this?"" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care."
940,4,3,Kurt Loder,"[A limo with police escort pulls up to a house] And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit. [Phil gets out of the limo and goes to the front door]"
941,4,3,Phil Collins,"[in the living room] Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him?"
942,4,3,Richard Burch,Richarrrrd!
943,4,3,Helen Burch,Helennnn!
944,4,3,Richard Burch,'Oodleahah.
945,4,3,Kurt Loder,"Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news."
946,4,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's settle down! [the class is seated and attentive] Huhh I mean it; I want quiet! [the class is already quiet] My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin. [Clyde rubs his nose] Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?! [draws the words out slowly, but the class remains silent] Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex. [no one moves] Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!"
947,4,3,Eric Cartman,"[Clyde is a bit shocked] What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?"
948,4,3,Mr Garrison,[grabs his head a few times] This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
949,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? [has the bottle out. Mr. Garrison thinks a bit, then goes for the bottle, opens it up, and chugs some pills down]"
950,4,3,Eric Cartman,"There you go. [smiles, then frowns]"
951,4,3,Christina Aguilera monster,[comes out from behind Mr. Garrison's desk] Rowr.
952,4,3,Eric Cartman,Whah!
953,4,3,A singer,"Thank you, Baltimore! Good night!"
954,4,3,Jonesy,"[exits the dressing room with the other band members] Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami!"
955,4,3,Timmy Burch,"Timmiihh! [Skyler trails the others, and Phil Collins appears in a hallway intersection next to the dressing room]"
956,4,3,Phil Collins,"Excuse me, Skyler Morse?"
957,4,3,Skyler,[stops and turns] Yeah?
958,4,3,Phil Collins,Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.
959,4,3,Skyler,"Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla."
960,4,3,Phil Collins,"I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer."
961,4,3,Skyler,"Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run. [turns and starts walking away]"
962,4,3,Phil Collins,It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.
963,4,3,Skyler,[stops and looks back] Huh?
964,4,3,Phil Collins,"Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is ""Timmy,"""
965,4,3,Skyler,"Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld."
966,4,3,Phil Collins,"Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow."
967,4,3,Skyler,"[dejected, walks away and looks back] Uh, thanks man. See ya."
968,4,3,Phil Collins,That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense. [kisses his Oscar]
969,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmuh! [the Lords of the Underworld have finished their song]
970,4,3,Jonesy,"[leads the others into the dressing room] Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there."
971,4,3,Skyler,"[tosses his guitar aside] Yeah. All of them chanting ""Timmy, Timmy."""
972,4,3,Timmy Burch,[rolls in] Timmih!
973,4,3,Jonesy,"What's the matter, Skyler?"
974,4,3,Skyler,"The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy."
975,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
976,4,3,Skyler,And the Lords of the Underworld!
977,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
978,4,3,Skyler,"It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!"
979,4,3,"Lords of the Underworld
 Skyler
 Jonesy
 Mark","Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous."
980,4,3,Skyler,"[spins around and points] Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on! [heads for the door] I don't need Timmy! [grabs Monsy's guitar on the sofa] I'm goin' solo!"
981,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
982,4,3,Skyler,"[at the door] No! Don't try and stop me, man! [turns to exit] I'll see you on fame's backside. [leaves]"
983,4,3,Timmy Burch,Ooo livin' a lie!
984,4,3,Terrance and Phillip,"Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?"
985,4,3,Terrance and Phillip,[bends to look] Let me see. [Phillip farts on him and they crack up]
986,4,3,Terrance and Phillip,"How do you like that, Terrance?"
987,4,3,Stan Marsh,Let's watch something else.
988,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, let's. [Cartman starts channel-surfing, then stops]"
989,4,3,Announcer,You're watching VH1.
990,4,3,The Boys,Ahhhh.
991,4,3,Anchor,Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up.
992,4,3,Stan Marsh,Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
993,4,3,Anchor,"And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler."
994,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
995,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter."
996,4,3,Eric Cartman,"I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins."
997,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
998,4,3,Stan Marsh,Sounds good.
999,4,3,Eric Cartman,"So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. [a Christina Aguilera bug is crawling all over Kenny] Hooray. [looks] Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. [takes his pan and swings it at Kenny. It strikes, and Kenny's face is smashed in. Kenny falls forward, hits the floor, and a puddle of blood forms under him]"
1000,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny."
1001,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Bastard.
1002,4,3,Chef,"Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. [Along with Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Tweek's parents, Liane Cartman, Craig's parents, and another set of parents are present]"
1003,4,3,Randy Marsh,"Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it."
1004,4,3,Chef,"I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. [puts in the tape. The VCR does the rest]"
1005,4,3,Dr Shay,"Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder. [three kids are in a classroom setting, acting up. Dr. Shay enters] This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child."
1006,4,3,Girl,"[Dr. Shay walks up to her and listens as she rattles off] I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara- [he smacks her behind the ear] Ah!"
1007,4,3,Dr Shay,"Sit down and study! [she looks at him scared, then picks up a book and opens it, looking at him all the while. He moves on to the boy in the middle desk]"
1008,4,3,Boy 1,"Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! [Dr. Shay smacks him too, making him turn aside. He turns back]"
1009,4,3,Dr Shay,Sit down and study!
1010,4,3,Boy 1,"[looks at him, then starts crying] Wwaaahahahahaaha [Dr. Shay smacks him again. The other boy stops and looks]"
1011,4,3,Dr Shay,"Stop crying and do your schoolwork! [the boy opens his book. He and the girl start reading. The Dr. moves over to the other boy, and he just cracks open his book and reads. The doctor address the camera] If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, ""You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again."" Thank you. [Chef turns the tape off]"
1012,4,3,Chef,"Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee."
1013,4,3,Sharon Marsh,That video had pretty colors.
1014,4,3,Gerald Broflovski,It sure did.
1015,4,3,Chef,What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
1016,4,3,Parents,Yes.
1017,4,3,Chef,"Awww, fudge it! [throws the remote aside. The boys enter]"
1018,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?"
1019,4,3,Chef,The what?
1020,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us."
1021,4,3,Parents,Yes.
1022,4,3,Chef,Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
1023,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
1024,4,3,Chef,Oh my God!!
1025,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Come, see him with us."
1026,4,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again! [runs around] She's on my back! Hah! [leaves]"
1027,4,3,Chef,That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
1028,4,3,Pharmacist,Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.
1029,4,3,Clinic Doctor,That's easily another twenty grand apiece! [the pharmacist laughs and Chef arrives]
1030,4,3,Chef,"[pounds on the door] Hey, open this damn door. [the doctor and pharmacist cover the money and go to the front door.]"
1031,4,3,Pharmacist,Can I help you?
1032,4,3,Chef,Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
1033,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-"
1034,4,3,Chef,I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
1035,4,3,Clinic Doctor,Huh?
1036,4,3,Chef,"All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!"
1037,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-"
1038,4,3,Chef,"You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!"
1039,4,3,Pharmacist,"Eh wuh, what?? [he and the doctor are shocked]"
1040,4,3,Chef,That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
1041,4,3,Clinic Doctor,Mm- my God. What have we done?? [beings to weep]
1042,4,3,Pharmacist,"Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God! [beings to weep as well]"
1043,4,3,Chef,"Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!"
1044,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them."
1045,4,3,Chef,Then we need an antidote!
1046,4,3,Pharmacist,"Yes, of course."
1047,4,3,Clinic Doctor,"Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?"
1048,4,3,Pharmacist,"I have some right here. [takes a bottle from a medicine case] It's a compound called ""Ritalout."""
1049,4,3,Chef,"Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! [rushes out]"
1050,4,3,Phil Collins,"[the crowds clap to the rhythm]Last night I went, ""O!""BubudioLast night I went ""Bubudio"""
1051,4,3,Chef,"[leads the doctor and pharmacist to a lemonade stand.] Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. [""Last night I went 'Bubudio.'"" The pharmacist starts placing the Ritalout tablets in the drinks]"
1052,4,3,Phil Collins,"Last night I went, ""O!""Bububudio. [takes a bow. People clap a bit]"
1053,4,3,Randy Marsh,"Wasn't that great, son?"
1054,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Sure was, Dad."
1055,4,3,Gerald Broflovski,It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
1056,4,3,Chef,"[arrives with a tray of lemonade] Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. [Kyle reaches for his drink and takes a sip]"
1057,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. [takes a glass. He and Kyle drink at the same time as Chef leaves]"
1058,4,3,Phil Collins,"I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled, ""You'll Be In... Me."" [goes to the piano, sets the Oscar on the piano top and starts playing it] Thanks.You're inside of me.Deep inside of me. [Chef hands drinks to more kids]So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart."
1059,4,3,Chef,"Come on, drink it down. It's free."
1060,4,3,Eric Cartman,You'll be inside of me...
1061,4,3,Christina Aguilera monster,[appears on his shoulder] Rowr.
1062,4,3,Eric Cartman,Huh? Oh no! Agh! [tries to shake it off as it nibbles on his shoulder] Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
1063,4,3,Stan Marsh,I feel... different.
1064,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. [the monster munches loudly on Cartman]
1065,4,3,Eric Cartman,"Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh[the monster still munches on him as he rolls on the ground]"
1066,4,3,Chef,"[arrives] Drink this, Eric. [pours the lemonade Ritalout into Cartman's mouth, and the Christina Aguilera monster dissolves] God help me! Heh, get it... [turns over on his stomach] She's gone! Thank God!"
1067,4,3,Phil Collins,"[looks at the audience] Well, thanks! [continues playing. The camera focuses n Stan and Kyle...]"
1068,4,3,Stan Marsh,Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
1069,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
1070,4,3,Chef,[returns to the doctor and pharmacist] I think it's working.
1071,4,3,Audience,Booooo!!
1072,4,3,Phil Collins,"[stops the music] Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards!"
1073,4,3,Stan Marsh,"Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!"
1074,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
1075,4,3,Phil Collins,You just wanna laugh at him.
1076,4,3,Stan Marsh,"No! [steps forward] You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!"
1077,4,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
1078,4,3,Audience,Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!
1079,4,3,Jonesy,"Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala. [The cry begins to reach them: ""Tim-my! Tim-my!""]"

1081,4,3,Skyler,"[returns to the band] Hey dudes. [""Tim-my! Tim-my!""]"
1082,4,3,Jonesy,"Skyler, what are you doing here?! [""Tim-my! Tim-my!""] Isn't Reach for the Skyler supposed to play soon? [""Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!""]"
1083,4,3,Skyler,"They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. [""Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!""]"

1085,4,3,Skyler,"I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head... [""Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!""]"
1086,4,3,Timmy Burch,"Timmih! [""Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!""]"

1090,4,3,Timmy Burch,"Rrr, rrr, uh, Timmih. [""Tim-my! Tim-my!""]"
1091,4,3,The Lords,Alright!
1092,4,3,Host,"Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh!"
1093,4,3,Timmy Burch,"[rolls up to the mic] Timmiihh, and the Lords of the Underworld! [Skyler looks over at Timmy with pride, then starts the band up] Timmiihh! [he's learned to move like the other band members do] Timmih! Livin' a lie-ah! [Stan and Kyle grin. Kyle then waves. Chef, the pharmacist and the doctor sway to the music] Hidilah Timmy! [his parents, Richard and Helen, are there] Timmuh- Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!"
1094,4,3,The Lords,And the Lords of the Underworld.
1095,4,3,Phil Collins,"[being moved over the audience] Put me down, you filthy bastards! [he's turned face down, and his Oscar is sticking out of his ass] Awwww!"
1096,4,3,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh uluh-livin' a lie!
1097,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Okay, is everyone ready to go?"
1098,4,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville."
1099,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Me too. We were lucky to get tickets. [calls out] Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. [the boys, dressed in their Sunday best, walk in with heads down in resentment]"
1100,4,4,Liane,"Oh, don't they look precious?"
1101,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns"
1102,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things.."
1103,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Awwww!
1104,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,[rolls up] Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!
1105,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!"
1106,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each others' faces!"
1107,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Come on, everybody, let's go. [the others turn and head out the front door.]"
1108,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"[follows] Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man."
1109,4,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, this is so exciting"
1110,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley."
1111,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Where? [a clown appears next to him, and he looks up] Oh, no. [the clown pulls out an umbrella and a bicycle horn, squeezes the horn and gets showered by the umbrella. The adults laugh, and the clown offers him the umbrella] Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye. [the clown insists Stan take part, and the parents laugh at the sound of the horn] No, thank you. [the clown tries again] Go away, please."
1112,4,4,Eric Cartman,"He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it! [Liane smacks him on the back of the head] Ow. [the clown tries once more with Stan. Stan rolls his eyes, takes the umbrella, and is showered by it when the clown presses the horn. The crowd roars with laughter as the clown revels in his cleverness]"
1113,4,4,Randy Marsh,"You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? [Stan looks up angrily]"
1114,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[comments] Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! [the clown gets mad as Cartman talks, then takes the umbrella from Stan and walks away in a huff]"
1115,4,4,Announcer,"[affecting a French accent] Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu"
1116,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[echoes the announcer] Sarque du Son Bleu. [sticks his tongue out. A performer comes out and starts singing] Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain."
1117,4,4,Liane,"Eric, sshhhh. [the performer is joined by men rolling by in wheels behind him and others prancing by in front. The parents smile in awe]"
1118,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,How long does this thing last?
1119,4,4,Stan Marsh,Two hours.
1120,4,4,Eric Cartman,Awwwgh.
1121,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Awwwgh.
1122,4,4,Kenny McCormick,Awwwgh.
1123,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are curious. Each of the quints lays on her stomach and puts her feet over her back and on her head.]"
1124,4,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Woohoo!) [Stan and Kyle stir, and Kyle nudges Cartman]"
1125,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? [the quints pile on to make an X, then roll off and reposition themselves into a circle]"
1126,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa. [a few twirls, and the middle one is thrust into the air. The two girls on the outside leap up and land on the other two's heads and catch the middle girl, to form a pentagon. Then they form a large cat, then a yacht,...]"
1127,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude. [...then the Eiffel Tower, and finally, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The crowd cheers]"
1128,4,4,Stan Marsh,Yayy!
1129,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yayy!
1130,4,4,Eric Cartman,Yayy!
1131,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
1132,4,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, that was wonderful!"
1133,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again."
1134,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
1135,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!"
1136,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!"
1137,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! [they pass ""LE SOUVENIRS,"" a booth manned by a clown dressed in yellow.]"
1138,4,4,Clown in yellow,"[the boys turn to see him] Don't forget to buy your souvenirs, folks. [the adults gather and clamor for the items on display. As they do, the boys talk]"
1139,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?"
1140,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash."
1141,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville."
1142,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
1143,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. [the boys turn to leave]"
1144,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Let's go practice. [they exit]
1145,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold."
1146,4,4,A Quint,"Did we do good final show, Grandmama?"
1147,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much. [a knock on the dressing room door, and two stern men walk in]"
1148,4,4,Romanian official,"Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania."
1149,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready. [the men leave, and she looks to the dressing room window. She walks over, opens the window, turns, and] This way, girls. Quickly. [the girls head for the window. Grandmama lifts them out one by one.]"
1150,4,4,Quint 2,"Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?"
1151,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance. [drops the girl off outside]
1152,4,4,Romanian official,Nid kelmin da bushka.
1153,4,4,Attendant,Nid kelmin da lushka velt
1154,4,4,Romanian official,"Nid kelmin da bushka ayn zolt! [the men laugh, the attendant looks at his watch]"
1155,4,4,Attendant,M-Mrs. Vladchick? [the men enter and find the open window and no one at all]
1156,4,4,Romanian official,Dash fam da bushka!
1157,4,4,Attendant,They're trying to defect! [they rush up to the end of a dock just as Mrs. Vladchick and her granddaughters take off in a dinghy]
1158,4,4,Romanian official,"[pumping a fist] Cauch! We need a boat. [sees two native men in a canoe, about to leave. He and the attendant walk over to them and gives one of the paddlers some money]"
1159,4,4,Native paddler in vest,"Where to, Mack?"
1160,4,4,Romanian official,"[gets on the canoe] Follow that boat. [the attendant gets on, and the four men paddle away]"
1161,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this isn't working."
1162,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,It's Kenny's singing!
1163,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Hunh?)
1164,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!"
1165,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(I'm singing as good as I can!)
1166,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! [Grandpa rolls by and notices the boys in dance poses]"
1167,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders."
1168,4,4,Romanian Official,"There's nowhere to go, Mrs. Vladchick. Pull over! [the canoe has caught up to the dinghy. Mrs. Vladchick looks back, then looks forward. They are closing in on a dock full of explosives, and she looks on in horror]"
1169,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Okay girls, the Cam Ay Alta. [the girls pile on Grandmama and form a tower, each female grabbing the head of the one below her. The top girl grabs a branch with a free hand, and all swing up in the air as one. The dinghy goes on with the canoe in pursuit]"
1170,4,4,Romanian Official,"[In a high pitched voice] Be careful, Gabul! Be careful, Gabul! Yaaah! [the canoe runs into the dock and they both blow up. Pieces of the four men fall from the air.]"
1171,4,4,Top Girl,"Did we do good, Grandmama?"
1172,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Very good, Glacas."
1173,4,4,Stan Marsh,"I'm tired, Grandpa."
1174,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more MacGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya. [the doorbell rings] Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night?"
1175,4,4,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. [walks over and opens the door] Whoa. [before him are the contorting Romanian quintuplets and their Grandmama, all shivering. Randy and Sharon show up in their pajamas]"
1176,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
1177,4,4,Randy Marsh,You're from Cirque du Cheville. [Grandpa shows up]
1178,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
1179,4,4,Randy Marsh,Well...
1180,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. [the girls grin and enter]"
1181,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,"Oh, thank you so much. [walks in]"
1182,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....?"
1183,4,4,Grandmama Vladchick,Vladchick. [Sharon escorts her and the girls upstairs]
1184,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.
1185,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!"
1186,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Well, it's good for 'im."
1187,4,4,Kenny McCormick,"[reads ""Learning to Sing Better""] (Let's see... No, not there) [tosses the book away and picks up ""The Essence of Voicing""] (Let's see.

1213,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping."
1214,4,4,Sharon Marsh,Poor dear must be tired.
1215,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,[rolls in] You're damn right she's tired.
1216,4,4,Randy Marsh,Huh?
1217,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. [rolls out]."

1219,4,4,Eric Cartman,What's going on?
1220,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you're not gonna believe this."
1221,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! [they all turn, and the quints stand before them]"
1222,4,4,Quint 1,Hello.
1223,4,4,Quint 2,Hello.
1224,4,4,Quint 3,Hi.
1225,4,4,Quint 4,Hello.
1226,4,4,Eric Cartman,No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
1227,4,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
1228,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What's a ""quin-tuplet""?"
1229,4,4,Quint 2,"Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two."
1230,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,But there's only four of you.
1231,4,4,Quint 2,"No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia."
1232,4,4,Nadia,[steps out from behind Natalia] Hello.
1233,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?"
1234,4,4,All five quints in unison,"No, don't be ridiculous."
1235,4,4,Stan Marsh,Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
1236,4,4,A Quint,You have your own?
1237,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first."
1238,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Hey!)
1239,4,4,Eric Cartman,"But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!"
1240,4,4,Quint 1,Okay.
1241,4,4,Quint 3,Sounds good.
1242,4,4,Quint 2,Count me in.
1243,4,4,Quint 5,"Okay. [quint 4 says nothing, and the others look at her]"
1244,4,4,Quint 4,"...Oh, and me."
1245,4,4,The boys,All right!
1246,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up. [leaves, reaches Grandmama's room, and knocks] Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman? [knocks twice more] Ma'am? [opens the door, looks in, and flies are heard buzzing around. Mrs. Vladchick is stiff, mouth open, arms up as if holding someone. Randy shuts the door in horror, then opens it and looks in again to be sure, then shuts it again, horrified]"
1247,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"[rolls up] Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha."
1248,4,4,Randy Marsh,"[serious] No, Dad."
1249,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.
1250,4,4,Randy Marsh,"No, Dad, she's dead!"
1251,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"What?! [Randy opens the door and looks away, Grandpa rolls in to see for himself] Oh, dear Jesus!"
1252,4,4,Randy Marsh,It looks like she had a heart attack.
1253,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,No wonder she didn't say good-night.
1254,4,4,Randy Marsh,"[stares at him, then leans away] ...Ew!"
1255,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, hold it, hold it. [climbs over Cartman and Kyle to form a tower. The quintuplets have executed their X formation. Stan is trying to stand when all three boys tumble to the ground. The quints break their formation and drop down]"
1256,4,4,The boys,Ow! [Randy and Sharon walk out and approach the kids]
1257,4,4,Sharon Marsh,I don't know how to tell. You tell them. [they stop]
1258,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Uh, girls, we... have some bad news."
1259,4,4,Quint 5,What?
1260,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Um... [Sharon holds his hand] Everyone who has a grandma, step forward. [Stan and Cartman step forward, then the girls] Uh, not so fast, girls. [Sharon gasps and glares at him. The girls step back, then realize what has just happened. They begin to sob]"
1261,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Randy! [amid the sobs, some of the quints have questions]"
1262,4,4,Quint 2,Grandmama is dead?
1263,4,4,Quint 1,What are we going to do now? [Randy and Sharon stand there helplessly]
1264,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[in a low voice] You guys, come here. [steps forward. The others join him] This is totally awesome."
1265,4,4,Stan Marsh,What?!
1266,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,How can you say that?
1267,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!"
1268,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, yeah!"
1269,4,4,Stan Marsh,[rushes up] Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
1270,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Well, Stan, it's not really our-"
1271,4,4,Stan Marsh,They have nowhere else to go. [presses hands together] Please?
1272,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay."
1273,4,4,Stan Marsh,Hooray!
1274,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hooray!
1275,4,4,Eric Cartman,Hooray!
1276,4,4,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes. [someone takes a picture] If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more [""FEED THE QUINTS! One Dollar"" A man buys some fishsticks], you can feed them fishsticks."
1277,4,4,A Quint,"[hops up and down, then opens her mouth for a fishstick the man drops down to her] Mmm."
1278,4,4,Reporter,"Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania."
1279,4,4,Reporter,"Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world. [a last shot of the quints is seen] Back to you, Tom."
1280,4,4,President,This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.
1281,4,4,Romanian Official,This could kill our tourism.
1282,4,4,President,You know what to do. [they salute him and leave.]
1283,4,4,Instructor,"[at the piano] Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises. [plays the sequence C E G C G E C]"
1284,4,4,Kenny McCormick,[sings along] (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) [his mom looks on. The instructor and Kenny move on to the D and E scales.]
1285,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?"
1286,4,4,Instructor,"Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be."
1287,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(I wanna be really good)
1288,4,4,Instructor,"Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative."
1289,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Europe?)
1290,4,4,Mrs McCormick,We can't afford that.
1291,4,4,Instructor,"Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack."
1292,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Awww.)
1293,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and... you can sing on the way to make money."
1294,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
1295,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. [exits to the living room]"
1296,4,4,Randy Marsh,[follows her out] What? [The boys and the quints watch the news. Sharon and Randy join them]
1297,4,4,Anchor Tom and Field Reporters,"...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago."
1298,4,4,Man,[reading a statement at gunpoint] Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.
1299,4,4,Randy Marsh,Uh-oh.
1300,4,4,Stan Marsh,That's your dad?
1301,4,4,Quint 2,Maybe.
1302,4,4,Quint 1,But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.
1303,4,4,Man,How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
1304,4,4,Voice,"[hits the man on the head with the gun, k'chunk] Nadia!"
1305,4,4,Man,"Nadia, my sweet Barshta"
1306,4,4,Voice,[k'chunk] Baltania!
1307,4,4,Man,"Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. [the TV is turned off]"
1308,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going."
1309,4,4,Stan Marsh,"[gets up and runs to his parents] Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??"
1310,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? [looks at Randy]"
1311,4,4,Randy Marsh,I don't know.
1312,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[the girls look at him] You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there."
1313,4,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
1314,4,4,Sharon Marsh,We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. [she and Randy walk away]
1315,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Damn, we might be screwed."
1316,4,4,Stan Marsh,No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! [walks off]
1317,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[in a log ride with the other seven, passes a lumberjack scene] You see, in America we have... log rides! [Kenny and his mom are at a bus terminal in Denver. A couple passes by and drops some money into the hat. Next, Cartman and friends are at Burger Cook, a fast-food restaurant] Bacon double-cheeseburgers! [Kenny and his mom are now at Coyote Bus Lines (play on Greyhound Bus Lines) in St. Louis at night. A man peeks through a door, another man drops some money into the hat. Next day] Sheep-shearing contests!"
1318,4,4,A fan,Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah. [the girls look on expressionless then #2 and #3 look at each other skeptically. Kenny and his mom are now at JFK International Airport in New York. Kenny gets some more money]
1319,4,4,Eric Cartman,[showing the others around a three-story shopping mall] And shopping malls! Hooray! [the girls are grinning. Kenny finally lands in Europe and goes out through gate 96]
1320,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Woo hoo!)
1321,4,4,Romanian Official,"[no beard] Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children."
1322,4,4,Janet Reno,"[flanked by two agents in riot gear] Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away."
1323,4,4,Mr Vladchick,Okay. [the official smacks him with the back of the hand] Heh!
1324,4,4,Romanian Official,Our home is Romania. We love it there.
1325,4,4,Mr Vladchick,"Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there."
1326,4,4,Romanian Official,"If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return"
1327,4,4,Janet Reno,"Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest."
1328,4,4,Romanian Official,Protest?
1329,4,4,Janet Reno,"Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things."
1330,4,4,All three men,Oh.
1331,4,4,Janet Reno,"But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible. [the Romanians already look confused]"
1332,4,4,Protesters,Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
1333,4,4,Stephen Stotch,"Fur is murder! Fur is murder! [notices the stares] Oh, what are we protesting here?"
1334,4,4,A Protester,"[with a ""No Romania"" sign] Romania sucks!"
1335,4,4,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, let's see [His professional protest sign has multiple pages and he flips through from ""FUR IS MURDER"" to ""FREE KEVORKIAN,"" ""SLEEPING BAGS KILL,"" then ""ROMANIA SUCKS""] Here we go. Romania sucks!"
1336,4,4,Protesters,Romania sucks! Romania sucks!
1337,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"[looks out through the window. ""Romania sucks! Romania sucks! Romania sucks!""] Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal."
1338,4,4,Randy Marsh,"[""Romania sucks!""] That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold."
1339,4,4,Lead Agent Collins and other agents,"[backed by 11 other agents and a humvee] Attention, people inside the house! [Randy and Sharon look] You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until... [lowers the bullhorn. An agent comes up and whispers] Oh yeah, that's good. [back on the bullhorn] You have until Easter Sunday to comply."
1340,4,4,Protester,Nooo!
1341,4,4,Protesters,Boooo!
1342,4,4,Lead Agent Collins and other agents,"What?! [the protesters gang up on the agents, beating them with their signs]"
1343,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, let's try it again. Hup!"
1344,4,4,A Quint,Hup! [she leaps into position to complete the arch. Kyle and Cartman dive through and get up]
1345,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Alright!
1346,4,4,Randy Marsh,"[enters] Stan, we- [the sight of the undressed boys stops him]"
1347,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania."
1348,4,4,Stan Marsh,"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America."
1349,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??"
1350,4,4,Randy Marsh,"I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. [he and Sharon walk away]"
1351,4,4,Stan Marsh,Now what do we do?
1352,4,4,Reporter,"Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets. [just then, a helicopter flies in and hovers over the house. Janet Reno, dressed in a bunny suit, waits in the open door to be lowered]"
1353,4,4,Soldier,"Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan."
1354,4,4,Janet Reno,Right.
1355,4,4,Soldier,"We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say..."
1356,4,4,Janet Reno,"""Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."""
1357,4,4,Soldier,Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?
1358,4,4,Janet Reno,Ready.
1359,4,4,Soldier,Code blue!
1360,4,4,Janet Reno,Code blue! [drops down onto the yard]
1361,4,4,Music Instructor,"Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School."
1362,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
1363,4,4,Mrs McCormick,How much is all this gonna cost?
1364,4,4,Music Instructor,"Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor."
1365,4,4,Assistant,"Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here."
1366,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us."
1367,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
1368,4,4,Janet Reno,"[enters the kitchen through the back door] Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny. [sees nothing but furniture before her. She pulls out a an assault rifle with scope and silencer then moves forth] Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya. [Stan, his parents, and the quints watch TV in the living room, and Janet Reno peeks at them. Terrance and Phillip are heard on the TV. Janet Reno pulls back and flattens herself against the kitchen wall]"
1369,4,4,Phillip,"Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. [Reno pulls out an Easter egg and throws it at the girls. It ends up right in front of them]"
1370,4,4,Terrance,"Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb."
1371,4,4,Quint 2,"Oh, look. An Easter egg."
1372,4,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh, shi- [the Easter egg unleashes its tear gas, and all cough and choke]"
1373,4,4,Lead Soldier,"That's it. Let's move, move move move, move! [breaks through the front door and leads the other police officers in.] Give us the kids, now! Now!"
1374,4,4,Officer 1,Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor! [more officers stream in as Sharon drops down to the floor and assumes the fetal position]
1375,4,4,Officer 2,Find them!
1376,4,4,Janet Reno,[bursts through the master bedroom door] This is a bust! Hand over the quints! [police officers are already there looking for them under the bed and in dresser drawers. Reno joins them and heads for the closet. She opens a sliding door and finds Randy holding Stan in his arms and points her weapon at them thus comically recreating the famous image of the US Border Patrol agent pointing his MP5 submachine gun at six year old Elian Gonzalez held by his rescuer Donato Dalrymple] Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!
1377,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,[rolls in] What the hell's goin' on?! [all guns point to him]
1378,4,4,Officer 3,"Freeze, asshole!"
1379,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!"
1380,4,4,Officer 3,"Don't push me, man!"
1381,4,4,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Pull the trigger, you little pussy!"
1382,4,4,Officer 3,Gaahhh! [aims away from Grandpa and lets loose with gunfire]
1383,4,4,Officer 4,Gun! Gun! [fires into the room. Reno drops down to avoid getting hit. Bullets riddle the wall]
1384,4,4,Janet Reno,"Down! Down! [outside, the protesters back away from the house]"
1385,4,4,Protester,Riot! Riot! [protesters now move forward against a wall of police]
1386,4,4,Officer 5,"Pepper spray! Pepper spray! [the police harden their line, pull out their cans and spray the protesters, who drop down immediately coughing. The house blows up. When the smoke clears, Reno and two officers are seen carrying the quints away. They reach a black van and toss the girls inside.]"
1387,4,4,Officer 6,"Go ahead! In the van! [Reno goes in, followed by the other officers. One of them barks an order to the driver, and the van leaves the scene.]"
1388,4,4,Stan Marsh,"[standing in front of the still burning ruins of his house] Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!"
1389,4,4,Music Instructor,"Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him."
1390,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Good job, Kenny."
1391,4,4,Music Instructor,"Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?"
1392,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"[She kneels down and places her hand on Kenny's head] Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind."
1393,4,4,Kenny McCormick,(Sure!)
1394,4,4,Music Instructor,Alright!
1395,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!"
1396,4,4,Eric Cartman,"[arrives with Kyle] Dude, what the hell happened?"
1397,4,4,Stan Marsh,The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
1398,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!"
1399,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! Well, not this time!"
1400,4,4,Eric Cartman,Huh?
1401,4,4,Stan Marsh,"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side! [addresses the mob] Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!"
1402,4,4,Protester 1,Hmm.
1403,4,4,Protester 2,Yeaahh.
1404,4,4,Protester 3,I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30.
1405,4,4,Protester 4,"Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?"
1406,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime."
1407,4,4,Protester 5,Alright! [Fist pumps]
1408,4,4,Protester 6,Yeah!
1409,4,4,Protester 7,Down with Japan! [the mob moves away]
1410,4,4,Janet Reno,"Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy. [The girls are shown with their grinning father. Two of them sit on his laps, the other three stand in front]"
1411,4,4,Photographer,"Come on, girls. Smile. [the girls look downcast] We want you to look happy. Smile. [works a sock puppet on his left hand] Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's so silly. ""I'm so silly."" [the girls still have their eyes cast down]"
1412,4,4,Stuart and Mrs. McCormick,"Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and- [the butt of a rifle strikes the side of his head] Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much. [looks to his right] Man."
1413,4,4,Stan Marsh,Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
1414,4,4,Soldier,"[Holds out hand to stop their progress] You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father."
1415,4,4,Stan Marsh,"[whistles a signal] Come on, angry mob! [the mob appears behind him. All of them move forward and overrun the checkpoint. A lagging protester runs over a fallen soldier]"
1416,4,4,Soldier,Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
1417,4,4,Romanian Official,"[the bearded one] Alright, it is time for us to return to Romania."
1418,4,4,Janet Reno,[hears something] What is that?
1419,4,4,Officer 7,[at a window] It's the protesters. They're back.
1420,4,4,Janet Reno,God-damnit! [Puts back on her Easter Bunny 'helmet'] We'll take care of them. Come on!  [leaves the office]
1421,4,4,Officer 8,Let's move. Move!
1422,4,4,Officer 7,"Come on, come on, come on."
1423,4,4,Officer 9,"Come oonn, come oonn. [they follow Reno out, leaving the quints alone in front of a poster that reads ""Join the Army...  It's KILLER!!!"". The officers engage the protesters on a runway]"
1424,4,4,Officer 1,This is government property!
1425,4,4,Protester,Let the quints stay! [Reno and Sharon head for each other]
1426,4,4,Sharon Marsh,"You ruined my house! [lays out Reno using a baseball bat to the Bunny helmet. The quints look out the window, then turn around. Quint 2 hops off the bench and walks to the office phone]"
1427,4,4,Quint 1,"What are you doing, Nadia?"
1428,4,4,Nadia,I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing. The other girls look at each other.]
1429,4,4,Eric Cartman,Take that! [kicks an officer on the shin]
1430,4,4,Quint 3,[heads towards the battlefield and addresses everyone] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! [the other four quints are with her. Weapons and signs are lowered]
1431,4,4,Quint 1,All of you are acting like idiots!
1432,4,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
1433,4,4,Quint 1,None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves!
1434,4,4,Quint 2,"Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago [he removes his hat and holds it tight], and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!"
1435,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you suck, dude!"
1436,4,4,Quint 3,"And you Romanian leaders [both of them are there], you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid!"
1437,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!"
1438,4,4,Quint 3,And you protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life!
1439,4,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
1440,4,4,Quint 3,And you boys are the worst of all!
1441,4,4,Stan Marsh,Huh?
1442,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
1443,4,4,Eric Cartman,Huh?
1444,4,4,Quint 3,"You know nothing about Romania, and yet you assume America is so much better! Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America, but it is our home! We are Romanian! All you care about is your own stupid circus! [at this point, a limousine pulls up behind them. It's from the Oprah show. The driver opens the back door and the girls head for the back seat]"
1445,4,4,Janet Reno,"[has a protester in a headlock] Where are you going, girls?"
1446,4,4,Quint 1,"The only place we can go. We're going on Oprah and then a book tour. [turns and climbs in, followed by three others]"
1447,4,4,Quint 5,Yes. You can all kiss our little white Romanian asses! [wiggles her ass at the crowd and climbs in. The limo leaves and everyone is left in a state of shock.]
1448,4,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways."
1449,4,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, screw them!"
1450,4,4,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
1451,4,4,Stan Marsh,Whatever happened to Kenny?
1452,4,4,Romanian Protesters,Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! [a van pulls up and police officers all the way from the U.S. pour out]
1453,4,4,Officer 1,"[sternly] Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!"
1454,4,4,Romanian Protesters,Boooo!
1455,4,4,Officer 2,"Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's go. Move move move move! [bursts through the front door. Officers pour in and look all over the place for Kenny. They enter the master bedroom, and look under the bed and in dresser drawers. One of them head for the closet and opens the sliding door and again the Elian Gonzalez scene is recreated with Kenny and his mother facing the police]"
1456,4,4,Officer 3,"[seeing Mrs. McCormick holding Kenny] Hand over the boy, now!"
1457,4,4,Mrs McCormick,"Okay, okay!"
1458,4,4,Officer 3,"I mean it, lady, you've got about-! [his assault rifle goes off, riddling Kenny with bullets. His mom is distraught and drops Kenny] Whoops."
1459,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card! [tosses it in front of him] You can deny it, or cover it up."
1460,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't understand this game at all."
1461,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[Front of board game box is seen with 'Kurtis' spelled incorrectly with a 'C'] It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up."
1462,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Um, deny it?"
1463,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. [presses an electronic Bill Kurtis head]"
1464,4,5,Electronic Head,"[trembles from side to side] Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis."
1465,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card. [tosses it in front of him] You lose a turn."
1466,4,5,Stan Marsh,Sweet.
1467,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! [tosses the card in front of him]"
1468,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1469,4,5,Eric Cartman,I just gave you AIDS.
1470,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,AIDS?! [looks confused]
1471,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS."
1472,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns [Kyle turns angry] and 800 points. [camera pans back, and Kenny's parents appear at the door with arms around each other]"
1473,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?"
1474,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(No.)
1475,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"[tickling his wife] We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. [they walk off giggling]"
1476,4,5,Eric Cartman,"God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars."
1477,4,5,Stan Marsh,"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!"
1478,4,5,Eric Cartman,"...You see. [stands] Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!"
1479,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1480,4,5,Eric Cartman,"I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here [hovers his right hand at eye level], and all my friends are down here [hovers it at stomach level]."
1481,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!"
1482,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Nononono! Me h'myah [hand at eye level], you guys myah! [hand at chest level] — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. [hand at foot level. Then he straightens up] SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. [turns around, walks out, and towards the front door.]"
1483,4,5,Electronic Head,I'm Bill Kurtis.
1484,4,5,Eric Cartman,"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. [looks at Clyde Frog for a few seconds, then] Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog! [walks over to the chair and hops on] I can meet new friends on the Internet! [clicks the mouse and presses a few keys, then the computer chimes. A list of chat rooms comes up] Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys"" [moves the cursor to the title and clicks on it] That's perfect. [starts typing] Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li- [replies start cascading over his message] Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316. [click on Tony's reply and starts typing] Hi Tony. [clicks and reads the reply] ""So what are you into?"" [replies] Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face. [clicks and reads the reply] ""Kewl. Wanna get together? [softer] Smiley-face?"" [replies] Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face. [clicks and reads the reply] ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning."" [replies] Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face. [clicks, then brightly] You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!"
1485,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Hi, are you Tony? [the man looks unusually friendly]"
1486,4,5,Tony,Yeah. You're -Eric?
1487,4,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah! [gets into the booth and sits next to Tony]
1488,4,5,Tony,"[meekly, hands a bag to Cartman] I brought you some candy."
1489,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[takes the bag] Wow, cool!"
1490,4,5,Tony,[hands him two books] And some books on Kama Sutra.
1491,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends [Tony places his hand on Cartman's back and starts rubbing with an open smile]; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now."
1492,4,5,Tony,Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
1493,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. [two agents burst through the main door and head for Tony and Cartman]"
1494,4,5,Agent,"Hold it right there, scumbag!"
1495,4,5,Tony,[Quickly removes hands from Cartman] Huh?
1496,4,5,Eric Cartman,Huh?
1497,4,5,Agent,[pulls out some handcuffs] We monitored your little online chat. [cuffs Tony] Now you're coming with us! [hauls him away]
1498,4,5,Tony,[meekly] No! [the two agents whisk him outside]
1499,4,5,Eric Cartman,[concerned] What the hell just happened?
1500,4,5,Mom,"You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby."
1501,4,5,Dad,"Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby."
1502,4,5,Mom,"Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers!"
1503,4,5,Dad,You have to share your room with the baby!
1504,4,5,Mom,The baby.
1505,4,5,Dad,The baby!
1506,4,5,Mom,The baby!!
1507,4,5,Kenny McCormick,[wakes and sits up] (HAAAAAAAAGH!) [looks around]
1508,4,5,Mrs McCormick,[giggles] Stop it!
1509,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again."
1510,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, alright. [they get up and move when Kenny arrives with glove and baseball]"
1511,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Dad, I wanna play catch.)"
1512,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son."
1513,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(But I wanna play now!)
1514,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards."
1515,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Aw, alright."
1516,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it! [tosses it high, but straight for Kenny's glove. Kenny catches it] Good job. Now throw me one. [Kenny takes the ball out of the glove, looks at it in anger, and shoots it straight for his father's groin. Stuart doubles over in pain and covers his crotch] Ohp! Guhhogh! [groaning, he ends up on his side, then throws up]"
1517,4,5,Mrs McCormick,[opens the door and rushes out] What happened?!
1518,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Aw, he smacked me in the balls! [groans some more. Kenny tosses the glove to his mother]"
1519,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"[goes inside] (Woohoo!) [Stuart groans some more, then vomits]"
1520,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, we'll try this again. [starts typing as BigBoned] Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to- [More quickly than before, his screen fills with cascading replies. He picks one] Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy. [starts typing] Hello, HungDaddy. [reads the reply] ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf. [Says out loud:] Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. [Types and says:] Midgets piss me off. Frowny face. [clicks and moves on] Lemme see, how about this one?"
1521,4,5,Eric Cartman,[draws close to the man] Mister Hammerhead?
1522,4,5,Mr Hammerhead,[turns around and is instantly recognizable] Hi there.
1523,4,5,Eric Cartman,Mr. Garrison??
1524,4,5,Mr Garrison,[startled] Haah! Eric!
1525,4,5,Eric Cartman,You wanna be my friend?
1526,4,5,Mr Garrison,"Oh, crap!"
1527,4,5,Eric Cartman,"That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?"
1528,4,5,Mr Garrison,"Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing! [four agents appear and head for him]"
1529,4,5,Agent,"Alright, scumbag, we got you!"
1530,4,5,Mr Garrison,"[voice quivering] Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me."
1531,4,5,Agent,"Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chat—now, you're coming with us! [the four agents, two on either side of Garrison, take him away]"
1532,4,5,Mr Garrison,No-o!
1533,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!"
1534,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines. [elderly people are seen hooked up to them] Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out."
1535,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, man, that's terrible."
1536,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this. [plants his lips wide on the glass and blows out] Waaaaah! [as the seal takes hold, his cheeks puff up and the inside of his his mouth shows clearly — it is a blow face. Stan smiles]"
1537,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Haha, he-yeah ha. [makes his own blow face] Haaaaah."
1538,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,[makes the blow face and wags his tongue at the patients] Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
1539,4,5,Stan Marsh,[does the same] Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
1540,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks up] Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!"
1541,4,5,Stan Marsh,[looks and then faces him. Kyle follows] We're making faces at sick people.
1542,4,5,Eric Cartman,"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! [Stan and Kyle are confused and look at each other]"
1543,4,5,Stan Marsh,We don't know.
1544,4,5,Eric Cartman,"I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!"
1545,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt."
1546,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!"
1547,4,5,Stan Marsh,"You're not more mature than us, Cartman!"
1548,4,5,Eric Cartman,YES I AM!! [Stan and Kyle back up a bit. Cartman turns and walks away]
1549,4,5,Mr Garrison,"I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady."
1550,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants."
1551,4,5,Mr Garrison,O-ogh! [returns to the bed and sits]
1552,4,5,Tony,Do you like having your back rubbed?
1553,4,5,Mr Garrison,"Eat me, pervert!"
1554,4,5,Tony,Okay. [some commotion is heard outside. A group of men is seen approaching and the front door opens. The men walk in and approach the desk]
1555,4,5,Man,We demand you release these men at once!
1556,4,5,Officer Barbrady,Who are you?
1557,4,5,Man,"We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?"
1558,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters."
1559,4,5,Man,"Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!"
1560,4,5,Other NAMBLA Men,"[ad lib] Yeah, uh-huh."
1561,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"[stands up] Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI."
1562,4,5,Man,Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
1563,4,5,Other NAMBLA Men,Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
1564,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people [the men fall silent], I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!"
1565,4,5,Man,All these men wanted was to love a young boy! [pounds the table a few times] There is nothing wrong with love!
1566,4,5,Mr Garrison,"I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age. [gasps and shrieks] Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!"
1567,4,5,Man,"You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong. [turns and heads for the door] Come on, men! [the others follow him out, chattering]"
1568,4,5,Officer Barbrady,"[sits back down and plops his feet up] Wow, they've got activists for everything these days."
1569,4,5,Dr Mephesto,"I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese. [the ""cheesemunk""in the box groans] Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- [the doorbell rings] Who could that be? [walks over and opens the door] Why, it's little Eric Cartman."
1570,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Dr. Mephesto, I need help."
1571,4,5,Dr Mephesto,"Well of course, come in."
1572,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[follows Mephesto and Kevin in] You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me."
1573,4,5,Dr Mephesto,"[stops and faces him] Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people."
1574,4,5,Eric Cartman,Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
1575,4,5,Dr Mephesto,"Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA."
1576,4,5,Eric Cartman,NAMBLA?
1577,4,5,Dr Mephesto,Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
1578,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! [turns and walks out]"
1579,4,5,Dr Mephesto,Sure!
1580,4,5,Man,"[henceforth, NAMBLA leader] Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy."
1581,4,5,Members of North American Man-Boy Love Association,Awwww.
1582,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws, [pounds on the podium] we want the same!"
1583,4,5,Members of North American Man-Boy Love Association,[weakly] Yeah.
1584,4,5,Eager Man,Yeh-hehah-hah.
1585,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a- [Cartman enters and takes a seat. Men in the back row look on with some awe.] Can we... help you?"
1586,4,5,Eric Cartman,Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
1587,4,5,NAMBLA leader,You... do?
1588,4,5,Eric Cartman,Sure.
1589,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"[greatly relieved] Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus."
1590,4,5,Eric Cartman,[looks around] ...Sweet.
1591,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister."
1592,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(No!!) [the camera zooms in on him]
1593,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Yup, it's for sure!"
1594,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!"
1595,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. [the parents walk away]"
1596,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny."
1597,4,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
1598,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) [turns around and walks away in his parents' direction]
1599,4,5,Eric Cartman,[rushes up from the other direction] Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
1600,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you talking about, fatass?"
1601,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! [turns and walks away]"
1602,4,5,Pharmacist,"Can I help you, young lady?"
1603,4,5,Kenny McCormick,[wearing a blonde wig] (Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)
1604,4,5,Pharmacist,"Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there. [points to them. Kenny looks]"
1605,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Thanks.) [walks over and looks at them. He sees ""Morning After Abortion Pills,"" ""Baby - B- Gone,"" ""Get it outta me! (has an unknown, real woman's face pictured)"" ""Fetus Flusher"" ""Pregnant No More Super Size."" He takes the ""Pregnant No More"" pills to the counter]"
1606,4,5,Pharmacist,"Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents. [Kenny hands him a note that reads: I hereby give my daughter permission to abort her baby -Mother] Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?"
1607,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Cash.)
1608,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) [a rat climbs onto the sofa headrest; Stuart shoos it away]"
1609,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me."
1610,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Here.) [presents the mug]
1611,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink."
1612,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
1613,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Well, I can still drink. [grabs the mug and starts chugging away]"
1614,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(No! Daddy!) [looks on as Stuart finishes the mug off]
1615,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls. [seeing Kenny looking at him] What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of... [his stomach starts to churn, and he holds it] Who-o-oa."
1616,4,5,Mrs McCormick,What's the matter?
1617,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Uh oh.)
1618,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants! [rushes to the bathroom]"
1619,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oohhh, God! [farts and craps in pain] Oooh, my balls! [Kenny appears at the door. Stuart turns around and vomits into the toilet. He alternates between crapping and vomiting, farting all the while] Ooh, God [more alternating between pooping and vomiting as Kenny just stares]"
1620,4,5,NAMBLA Member,"Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child."
1621,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, dude. [poses in his beefcake swim pants for several shots before a curtain that says ""I LOVE NAMBLA""]"
1622,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"[arrives with some other members] Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child."
1623,4,5,Eric Cartman,Really? Awesome![continues to pose in various ways as camera shutter sounds are heard]
1624,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends. [the guys behind him start to drool]"
1625,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature, [looks back at the camera and mumbles] excluding Stan and Kyle, of course."
1626,4,5,NAMBLA leader,"Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready."
1627,4,5,Eric Cartman,KIIICK ASS!
1628,4,5,Mrs McCormick,[off-screen] Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. [Kenny hops off as one commercial ends. Another one draws his attention.]
1629,4,5,Announcer,"[echo on] Hey, are you feeling down? You need some excitement. And North Park Funland has just opened its newest ride! The John Denver Experience! [the ride is demonstrated] You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT."
1630,4,5,Two Guys,"[""ACTUAL TESTIMONIAL""] It was-"
1631,4,5,Guy 1,[holds up right thumb] -fun.
1632,4,5,Guy 2,[holds up left thumb] -fun.
1633,4,5,Announcer,Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!
1634,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Mom!) [walks away]
1635,4,5,Stuart McCormick,Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
1636,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, it's all right. [in a low voice] You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. [the line moves forward. Kenny and his parents find seats in the first row. The ride itself is wrapped in the body of a small plane, with a wing serving as a ramp]"
1637,4,5,John Denver Experience Ride Operator,"[speaks into a muffled PA system] Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride here at the John Denver Experience. Have fun."
1638,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"What did he say? [the ride swings up smoothly, but at the top it swings into high gear, slamming into the platform during one swing, into a building during another swing, and back and forth this way a few times. Mrs. McCormick is enjoying it quite a bit. The ride ends with a slam into a large pool, where the plane rests upside down] ...John Denver Experience."
1639,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!"
1640,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom."
1641,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, I'm not gonna make it. I'm gonna be sick! [heads for the nearest trash can and vomits into it. A woman carrying her baby moves away. He grabs his stomach] Oh, my stuhomach! [pulls down his pants and poops in the trash can] Oh, my nose! [sneezes blood into the trash can] Augh! [vomits, poops, and sneezes, and this goes on for quite a while. Kenny simply slaps his hand to his head and rolls his eyes.]"
1642,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor."
1643,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,They are?
1644,4,5,Eric Cartman,"We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!"
1645,4,5,Stan Marsh,[angry] We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
1646,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go."
1647,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,We don't wanna go!
1648,4,5,Eric Cartman,You can't go.
1649,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,We don't WANNA go!
1650,4,5,Eric Cartman,"No, you CAN'T go. [turns around and walks away] Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out"
1651,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature."
1652,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too."
1653,4,5,Dr Doctor,"You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick. [sees Kenny sneaking a peek] It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life. [Kenny approaches and is covered in amniotic fluid as his mom's water bursts]"
1654,4,5,Kenny McCormick,(Eeww.)
1655,4,5,Dr Doctor,I can see its head!
1656,4,5,Ms McCormick,You can?
1657,4,5,Dr Doctor,"Push, now. Push hard! [Ms.McCormick holds onto Stuart's hand hard and pushes the baby out. The doctor shields his face] Oh my God. [the nurse screams in horror]"
1658,4,5,Ms McCormick,What is it?? [the baby is shown; it is a mutant with long claws and a nasty disposition]
1659,4,5,Dr Doctor,"[turns to run] It's ali- [the mutant baby decapitates Dr. Doctor, the nurse, and Kenny]"
1660,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh my God, it killed Kenny!"
1661,4,5,Ms McCormick,"Bad baby, bad!"
1662,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"[sits up awake] (Huh. Huh??) [looks around and realizes he's awake] (That does it!) [jumps off, goes to the bathroom and gets a plunger. Then he leaves the restroom]"
1663,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"[lowers the book] Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'? [he lifts the plunger and aims it at her] Uh what are you doing, Kenny? [he fixes his gaze on her] Kenny, what are you going to plunge?"
1664,4,5,Kenny McCormick,[rushes at her with the plunger] (AAAARRRRHHH!)
1665,4,5,Mrs McCormick,Aaaaaaah! [jumps off the sofa and runs away] AAAAA! [Stuart arrives as Kenny pursues his mom]
1666,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Kenny, what the hell are you doing?! [follows them out]"
1667,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[sees them] What the hell? [hops off his chair and walks towards them] Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!"
1668,4,5,Stan Marsh,"We got invited too, fatass!"
1669,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Hunh. [rolls his eyes] Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA."
1670,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"[now at the podium, a little giddy] Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us."
1671,4,5,NAMBLA Member,"Oh, yeah. [others cheer]"
1672,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys."
1673,4,5,Eric Cartman,"[graciously, amid some applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [takes a bow] Thank you."
1674,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members."
1675,4,5,Stan Marsh,This is boring.
1676,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [yells] HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?"
1677,4,5,Member 1,Ho hohohoho
1678,4,5,Member 2,"Woohoohoohoohoo. [others react similarly, lustily]"
1679,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"[barely containing his glee] Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... ""get"" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick."
1680,4,5,Patrick and Mr. Harris,"Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful [Butters lights up], bright, little boy."
1681,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, uh I sure am, I guess."
1682,4,5,Patrick and Mr. Harris,And his skin is as soft as fresh linen. [the other men savor the statement]
1683,4,5,Stan Marsh,[to Kyle] That seems kind of... weird.
1684,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose."
1685,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?"
1686,4,5,Mr Harris,"[with a stammer] Well, I want to announce that I may have found the dream boy of the decade. He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk. His name is Timmy."
1687,4,5,Timmy Burch,"TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?"
1688,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance! [the DJ starts the music again, and the boys and their partners take the dance floor. Stan and Kyle stay in their seats, as do Cartman and his partner.]"
1689,4,5,Lead Agent,"Alright, I want those perverted bastards all taken in. Got it?"
1690,4,5,Agents,Got it!
1691,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,"[Kevin at his side] Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South Park representative- [the doors fly open and the FBI agents fill the room]"
1692,4,5,Lead Agent,[heading for Mephesto] Hold it right there!
1693,4,5,Agent 1,Freeze!
1694,4,5,Agent 2,Don't nobody move!
1695,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,What's going on? [four rifles and a shotgun are pointed at him]
1696,4,5,Lead Agent,"Alright, sickos. Where are the children?! [the NAMBLA members look at each other confused]"
1697,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,What children?
1698,4,5,Lead Agent,"This... is... NAMBLA, right?"
1699,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,Yes.
1700,4,5,Lead Agent,The North American Man/Boy Love Association?
1701,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,"[startled] What? No! [Points to the banner behind him] We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes. [a shot of the members is shown, and many of them do look like Marlon Brando]"
1702,4,5,Blond Agent,"Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA."
1703,4,5,Mr Garrison,"Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place. [gets up and walks out]"
1704,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
1705,4,5,Lead Agent,You know of them?
1706,4,5,Blond Member,Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com!
1707,4,5,Brunet Member,"Yeah, those perverted bastards!"
1708,4,5,Blond Agent,Wow. You guys really do look a lot like Marlon Brando.
1709,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,"Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!"
1710,4,5,Members of North American Man-Boy Love Association,Yeah! Yeah!
1711,4,5,Black Member,And let's kick their asses for stealin' our domain name!
1712,4,5,Members of North American Man-Boy Love Association,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
1713,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"[Cartman stands next to him] Alright, members, that's enough of that. [the music is stopped] It's time for all of us to retire to our respective rooms, and get to know our new young boys. [NAMBLA members rub their hands react lustily]"
1714,4,5,Member 3,All right.
1715,4,5,Member 4,Alright.
1716,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. Being mature is boring!
1717,4,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
1718,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm."
1719,4,5,The Boys,Aaaaah! [all pour out into the hallway]
1720,4,5,Stan Marsh,Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
1721,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! [music resumes. All the boys turn and head for the stairs, only to see shadows moving up the wall, and they stop in their tracks]"
1722,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! [the boys run into room 1A. Mephesto shows up and leads the other look-alikes onto the hallway]"
1723,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,"Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room. [they enter 2E. The FBI then arrives amid much commotion]"
1724,4,5,Lead Agent,"Let's get those perverts! [the agents fan out and enter all rooms except 1A and 2E. A waiter heads for the stairs with a tray, but naked NAMBLA members pour out of their rooms and startle him. The tray flies off his hand]"
1725,4,5,Waiter,Sacrebleu! [picks up the tray and heads back to the room he left. The NAMBLA members go into 1A]
1726,4,5,The Boys,Whoa! [pour out of 1A and head down the hall to 2E. The door there opens and the Marlon Brandos peek out]
1727,4,5,The Boys and The Brandos,"Aaah! [the boys run to 1E, the Brandos go back into 2E, and the doors to both are shut]"
1728,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"[enters the hallway from the stairs] Kenny, no! Leave me alone [heads into 1C]"
1729,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Come here, mom! Let me get it!) [follows her in. The agents pour out of the rooms and switch places, again avoiding 1A and 2E. Stuart arrives and looks around]"
1730,4,5,Stuart McCormick,Kenny?? [enters 2C. The waiter again heads for the stairs with the tray]
1731,4,5,Waiter,"Zis time, I will not drop zeh food. [makes it to the top of the stairs, but drops the tray when the NAMBLA members exit 1A] Allo!"
1732,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?! [the NAMBLA members enter 2A]
1733,4,5,Waiter,"[picks up the tray and goes back down the hall, angrily] Sacre bleu! [the door to 2E opens and the Marlon Brandos step out]"
1734,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,I think the boys went in here. [the Brandos enter 1E]
1735,4,5,The Boys,[all exit 1E] Aaaaaah!
1736,4,5,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [all enter 2D. A poodle on a ball exits 1C and enters 2D. The NAMBLA members exit 2A and head for 1C]
1737,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys? [the NAMBLA members enter 1C. Kenny's mom and Kenny exit 1C]
1738,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, GIVE IT UP!"
1739,4,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Come on!) [both enter 2C. The waiter heads for the stairs again with the tray, but Marlon Brandos and FBI agents pour out of 1E]"
1740,4,5,Waiter,[falls backwards] Waaah!
1741,4,5,Lead Agent,"Alright, you're under arrest!"
1742,4,5,Dr. Mephesto,No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!
1743,4,5,Lead Agent,Damnit!
1744,4,5,Agent,"Hey, we didn't try that room! [Brandos and agents head for 2A and enter. Two guys in vintage bikes ride across from 2D to 1D]"
1745,4,5,Waiter,"[exasperated, gets up with the tray] Sacre bleu. [walks away, having given up on the stairs]"
1746,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,[panting] Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
1747,4,5,Eric Cartman,They're all over the place.
1748,4,5,Timmy Burch,Timmiihhh!
1749,4,5,Token Black,[Token joins the group] What are we gonna do?!
1750,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out."
1751,4,5,The Boys,Yeah.
1752,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out."
1753,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,How?
1754,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team. [the other boys are shocked at the thought] And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. [presents him]"
1755,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?"
1756,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Now, are you a team player or not?!"
1757,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess."
1758,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team."""
1759,4,5,Butters Stotch,Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
1760,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Just go, Butters. We're running out of time."
1761,4,5,Butters Stotch,Well uuh-uuh-alright then. [heads for the door. Stan sees him out and Cartman closes the door]
1762,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass."
1763,4,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, alright men. Here, here I come. [puts his hands over his eyes and moves across the hall] I'm ready to take one for the team. [enters 1D.]"
1764,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"[exits 2D] Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! [enters 1E]"
1765,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"[inside 1E] Oh, one of the boys just came in. [the members surround him and being their activity...]"
1766,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! [Butters steps out of 1D, listens in at the door to 1E, turns around and walks away.]"
1767,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"[voice shaking, approaches] Are you alright, Stuart?"
1768,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"[sobbing] Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men—I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! [the NAMBLA members are in cuffs]"
1769,4,5,Lead Agent,"[to NAMBLA Leader] We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?"
1770,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called ""freedom."" They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look at each other] You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand. [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at the NAMBLA leader]"
1771,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. You have sex with children.
1772,4,5,NAMBLA Leader,"We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away. [shots of the agents, then the Brando look-alikes, then Stan and Kyle, who look at each other, then at the NAMBLA leader]"
1773,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[slowly, for emphasis] Dude. You have sex with children."
1774,4,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you."
1775,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,Seriously.
1776,4,5,Lead Agent,"Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time. [The agents escort the NAMBLA members away. The members groan. The boys gather around Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]"
1777,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Cartman?"
1778,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, what?"
1779,4,5,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
1780,4,5,The Boys,Yeah!
1781,4,5,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There."
1782,4,5,Stan Marsh,"And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?"
1783,4,5,Eric Cartman,"No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. [the paramedics finish putting Stuart into the ambulance and head for the cab]"
1784,4,5,Paramedic,"Okay, let's roll. [the siren goes on. The ambulance goes into reverse and crushes Kenny under its rear wheels, then speeds off]"
1785,4,5,A Nurse,"[voice-over] Dr. Flores, dial 18-"
1786,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo."
1787,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Our little angel, yes."
1788,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. [a shot of the baby reveals a boy in a little orange parka with the hood tight on his face, like Kenny before him]"
1789,4,5,Mrs McCormick,What should we name him?
1790,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny."
1791,4,5,Mrs McCormick,"Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)"
1792,4,5,Stuart McCormick,"God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened."
1793,4,5,Mrs McCormick,Fifty-second.
1794,4,6,Mr Wyland,"Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland. [writes it on the chalkboard. A shot of the class reveals Kyle missing]"
1795,4,6,Eric Cartman,"[in a low voice] Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher."
1796,4,6,Mr Wyland,"Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers. [Cartman points at Craig] But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm. [runs his finger down the list] Eric Cartman?"
1797,4,6,Stan Marsh,"[raises his hand] Here! [he, Kenny, and Cartman laugh heartily]"
1798,4,6,Mr Wyland,"Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?"
1799,4,6,Kenny McCormick,"[raises his hand] (Here.) [he, Stan, and Cartman laugh heartily]"
1800,4,6,Wendy Testaburger,"It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus."
1801,4,6,Mr Wyland,"Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick?"
1802,4,6,Eric Cartman,"[raises his hand] Here. [he, Stan, and Kenny laugh heartily. A few seconds later his nose bleeds a white liquid all over his desk] Oh, hoho. Ow."
1803,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the hell was that?"
1804,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!"
1805,4,6,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk."
1806,4,6,Eric Cartman,Huh?
1807,4,6,Stan Marsh,You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
1808,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Not with me, man."
1809,4,6,Mr Wyland,"Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today. [reaches into the bag and pulls out some glue and glitter] I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski?"
1810,4,6,Stan Marsh,[drawn out] He's fakin'!
1811,4,6,Mr Wyland,"Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it."
1812,4,6,The Class,Awww. [the kids leave their seats and head for the front of the class. Cartman remains in his seat]
1813,4,6,Eric Cartman,[drawn out] He's fakin'! [the other kids get busy decorating the card]
1814,4,6,Mr Wyland,"Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too."
1815,4,6,Eric Cartman,But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
1816,4,6,Mr Wyland,I don't care! Get down here and do it!
1817,4,6,Butters Stotch,"Hey, watch it! [Mr. Wyland looks down at the group] Hey, what are you doin'? [the kids back away to reveal Butters decorated, not the poster board. A sign hangs on him saying ""Get Well Kyle""]"
1818,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Now, that's a get-well card! [the others laugh. Cartman soon joins them, but his nose begins to leak that white liquid again. He covers his nostrils and continues laughing]"
1819,4,6,Chairman,"Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely."
1820,4,6,Mr Garrison,What??
1821,4,6,Board Member,"Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting. [a look of disbelief comes across Mr. Garrison's face]"
1822,4,6,Chairman,Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?
1823,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!"
1824,4,6,Chairman,"...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about. [reviews a sheet of paper] It's your somewhat substantial police record."
1825,4,6,Mr Garrison,"[stomps his foot down] Oh, whatever!"
1826,4,6,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-"
1827,4,6,Mr Garrison,"That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! [points to his puppet]"
1828,4,6,Board Member,"All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little [does quotes with two fingers on each hand] ""child molestation"" thing dies down a bit."
1829,4,6,Mr Garrison,"[rises from his chair] Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe."
1830,4,6,Chairman,"We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice."
1831,4,6,Mr Garrison,[crestfallen] Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore. [approaches the chairman] I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... [pulls them out and sets them on the table]
1832,4,6,Chairman,"Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!"
1833,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?[Grabs back his revolver]"
1834,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you."
1835,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Hello, sweetie. [Stan walks over to Kyle's bed]"
1836,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. [Kyle mumbles once more] Kyle?"
1837,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
1838,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. [Butters walks into the room still decorated from head to toe in glitter and glue, and he carries the sign in his right hand]"
1839,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Go on, Butters!"
1840,4,6,Butters Stotch,"Ho, I don't wanna!"
1841,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Butters, go on!"
1842,4,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh, uhuh alright, then. [starts to sing]
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
[brings out a cane and dances]
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, ""Get well soon!""
And ""Please don't die on us.""
[pulls a rip cord and a bunch of balloons inflate automatically around him. Kyle babbles some more]"
1843,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you really are sick, huh?"
1844,4,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know, I..."
1845,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous."
1846,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People."
1847,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,Really? In People?
1848,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named ""Miss Information."""
1849,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, well, with a name like ""Miss Information"" she must know something."
1850,4,6,Sharon Marsh,Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
1851,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,Okay. I'll get our coats. [turns and walks out the door. Kyle babbles some more]
1852,4,6,Butters Stotch,Can I go now?
1853,4,6,Mr Garrison,"[lying down on a couch] I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know."
1854,4,6,Mr Mackey,"[in a armchair] Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do."
1855,4,6,Mr Garrison,I've always wanted to write a novel.
1856,4,6,Mr Mackey,"Well, there you go, m'kay?"
1857,4,6,Mr Garrison,But I never know what to write about.
1858,4,6,Mr Mackey,Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
1859,4,6,Mr Garrison,Besides teaching?
1860,4,6,Mr Mackey,Yes.
1861,4,6,Mr Garrison,...Poontang.
1862,4,6,Mr Mackey,"M, m'kay"
1863,4,6,Mr Garrison,"I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world."
1864,4,6,Mr Mackey,"Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel."
1865,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Yes, that's it. [sits up brightly] I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!"
1866,4,6,Miss Information,"You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins."
1867,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,Toxins?
1868,4,6,Miss Information,"All the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper."
1869,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!"
1870,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. [Kyle coughs]"
1871,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?"
1872,4,6,Miss Information,What?
1873,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?"
1874,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Don't be a smartass, Stanley."
1875,4,6,Miss Information,"Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans."
1876,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. [Kyle begins to babble]"
1877,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good [sips some wine]
Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard.
[taps his chin with his left index finger. The computer screen is shown as the words are typed]
His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his
[pauses]
penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples
[music cuts off. He thinks] Uh, let's see... [taps his chin with his right index finger] Diana's nipples...[The words on the screen are shown halted at 'nipples'] [aloud] Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck. [turns his body to one side] Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat."
1878,4,6,Mrs Tweak,"Oh my, he looks terrible."
1879,4,6,Blonde Mother,"Yes, poor little dear."
1880,4,6,Miss Information,"[arrives] Good morning, everyone."
1881,4,6,Blonde Mother,"[walks up to her and brings her in] Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse. [Miss Information walks to Kyle's bed as Stan watches. She raises her arms and waves them over Kyle's body]"
1882,4,6,Miss Information,"Huuuuuuuuuh [lowers her arms] Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better."
1883,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,Really?
1884,4,6,Stan Marsh,What?
1885,4,6,Miss Information,"Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter."
1886,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, that's great news! [Kyle barfs and Stan steps out of the way]"
1887,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,Oh no!
1888,4,6,Miss Information,"Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system."
1889,4,6,Sharon Marsh,Ooooo.
1890,4,6,Stan Marsh,Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
1891,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!"
1892,4,6,Stan Marsh,Don't be a smartass?
1893,4,6,Miss Information,"Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!"
1894,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner."
1895,4,6,Other mothers,[ad lib] I agree. Yeah. That's right. [Stan looks defeated]
1896,4,6,Nurse,[over an intercom] Mr. Marsh is here to see you.
1897,4,6,Dr Doctor,"Alright, send him in. [from his desk, golf balls, a cup, and a set of golf clubs can be seen. Stan enters] Oh, Stanley."
1898,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Hi, doctor. [takes a seat]"
1899,4,6,Dr Doctor,How can I help you?
1900,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick."
1901,4,6,Dr Doctor,"He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine."
1902,4,6,Stan Marsh,But I don't think it's working.
1903,4,6,Dr Doctor,"Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die."
1904,4,6,Stan Marsh,[overwhelmed] Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
1905,4,6,Dr Doctor,"I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn."
1906,4,6,Stan Marsh,"...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care."
1907,4,6,Dr Doctor,"That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact, [looks at a sheet of paper] there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle."
1908,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Who? [Dr. Doctor turns the sheet around, and Cartman's picture is on it. A close-up reveals that Cartman has AB-negative blood] Oh, shit."
1909,4,6,Kenny McCormick,"(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.) [crashes the ship into a soldier]"
1910,4,6,Eric Cartman,"""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew [grabs for the yellow ship] Give me the space cruiser, Kenny."
1911,4,6,Kenny McCormick,"(No, no.)"
1912,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser [pulls the cruiser his way] so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5."
1913,4,6,Kenny McCormick,"[gets up as Cartman speaks] (Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!) [pulls the cruiser back] (There! It's mine!) [the doorbell rings and the two boys tug at the ship in opposite directions]"
1914,4,6,Eric Cartman,"No, mine. M'yah! [the ship breaks in two, with Kenny getting the short end] Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha [his nose spurts out white fluid again] bluh oh, ha-ow! [blocks his nostrils]"
1915,4,6,Liane Cartman,"[walks up] Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?"
1916,4,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
1917,4,6,Liane Cartman,"Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. [Stan enters with a sick Kyle in his arms]"
1918,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, mom."
1919,4,6,Liane Cartman,[genuflects and speaks softly to Cartman] And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. [Stan leaves Kyle and walks up to Cartman]
1920,4,6,Eric Cartman,"What's goin' on, guys?"
1921,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question."
1922,4,6,Eric Cartman,Oh-kay.
1923,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life."
1924,4,6,Eric Cartman,Uh huh.
1925,4,6,Stan Marsh,What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
1926,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I think I see where this is going. [Kyle moans]"
1927,4,6,Stan Marsh,"His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working."
1928,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Stan, why don't you just ask the question?"
1929,4,6,Stan Marsh,Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
1930,4,6,Eric Cartman,"[sings and dances]
No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!"
1931,4,6,Stan Marsh,"But you only need one, fat boy!"
1932,4,6,Eric Cartman,"No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!"
1933,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!"
1934,4,6,Kenny McCormick,[miffed] (It's not that's fucking serious.) [Kyle coughs twice]
1935,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price."
1936,4,6,Stan Marsh,Oh my God!
1937,4,6,Kyle Broflovski,How much?
1938,4,6,Eric Cartman,"I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?"
1939,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!"
1940,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars."
1941,4,6,Kenny McCormick,(Ten million dollars??)
1942,4,6,Stan Marsh,"What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!"
1943,4,6,Eric Cartman,"What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock."
1944,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. [they walk away]"
1945,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. [they return to the floor to continue play] ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!"
1946,4,6,Man 1,"Ooo, free-range aspirin!"
1947,4,6,Man 2,"All-natural cell phones! [Two stoners, who appear to be Richard 'Cheech' Marin and Tommy Chong, appear at the door with boxes of stuff]"
1948,4,6,Miss Information,"Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez. [shoppers gather around the men]"
1949,4,6,Man 3,[amid the chatter] Ooo.
1950,4,6,Man 4,I'd like to buy some more stuff.
1951,4,6,Man 5,"Come in. Come here, guys."
1952,4,6,Man 6,Do you have any new holistic items for sale?
1953,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,"Oohh, oh yeah. Aah... [holds up a decorated clothes hanger] Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher."
1954,4,6,Woman 1,"Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one. [other women start ordering them]"
1955,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"[holds up an item] Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people."
1956,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural."
1957,4,6,Miss Information,Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.
1958,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"Oh yeah. We love the earth, man."
1959,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,"Oh yeah, the earth is great."
1960,4,6,Miss Information,[walks up to Sheila] Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.
1961,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'."
1962,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,"[laughs] uh'hm, ho ho hm."
1963,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,Wonderful!
1964,4,6,Miss Information,[takes Sheila along] Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit. [the other shoppers crowd the two men]
1965,4,6,Man 7,D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff.
1966,4,6,Man 8,"Yes. Much, much more stuff."
1967,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk. [Ramirez starts to laugh] Come on. [turns to leave]"
1968,4,6,Miss Information,"Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you."
1969,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,Oh yah. You too and junk. [they head out the door and away]
1970,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"[off-screen] That's funny, man. [Stan walks in]"
1971,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste."
1972,4,6,Stan Marsh,You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
1973,4,6,Sharon Marsh,That's right.
1974,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't."
1975,4,6,Miss Information,"Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE. [to Sheila] Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars. [Sheila pays, and Miss Information rings it up]"
1976,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally."
1977,4,6,Stan Marsh,Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
1978,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!"
1979,4,6,Stan Marsh,And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
1980,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Enough, Stanley!"
1981,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Nobody wants to listen, Kenny."
1982,4,6,Kenny McCormick,(I know.)
1983,4,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again."
1984,4,6,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh.)
1985,4,6,Stan Marsh,"I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do. [Kenny gets mad, Stan gets resolute] Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! [walks away]"
1986,4,6,Kenny McCormick,(Rrrh!)
1987,4,6,Mr Garrison,"[We hear Mr Garrison's thoughts]
Chapter 18.
Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about.
[out loud]Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up!
And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused. [Words on the computer screen are seen typed] ""Go on"", Rebecca said softly, ""Touch me."" Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises.
[unconsciously, his right hand (Mr Hat hand) lowers down towards his crotch and is soon out of view, but the arm moves around some...]
They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with...
[catches himself masturbating] Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?! [looks around to see that no one is watching, then happily] Oh, Mr. Hat!"
1988,4,6,Stan Marsh,"[checks his watch] Come on, where are they? [looks around. Three boys approach from his left: Kenny, Butters, and Timmy]"
1989,4,6,Stan Marsh,This is it??
1990,4,6,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh)
1991,4,6,Timmy Burch,Timmiiihh!
1992,4,6,Stan Marsh,This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
1993,4,6,Butters Stotch,"Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot."
1994,4,6,Stan Marsh,"[quite disappointed] Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!"
1995,4,6,Butters Stotch,"Huh, where are we goin'?"
1996,4,6,Stan Marsh,We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. [the others look are shocked]
1997,4,6,Mother,"[Smiling, empty-headed into the distance]"
1998,4,6,Daughter,[hesitantly] Mom... Do you ever have those heavy flow days?
1999,4,6,Mother,"[Places her hand comfortingly on her daughter's thigh] Oh absolutely sweetheart, everybody does."
2000,4,6,Daughter,"[Camera zooms in on her face] Mom, remember the movie The Shining where the elevator doors are opening up.."
2001,4,6,Mother,[Camera switches to close-up on mother's face] Oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon. [grabs her daughter's hand and shakes hands in emphasis]
2002,4,6,Daughter,[Camera zooms back out] Like what?
2003,4,6,Mother,"Well, what's the most absorbent thing in the world?"
2004,4,6,Daughter,"[Looks down, plays with her hair and mulls it over] Well... Cherokee hair I guess.  [Camera zooms back on her face] But what does that have to do with me?"
2005,4,6,Mother,"[Camera zooms out and mother grabs a box] 
Because now there is all new, natural 
[Camera zooms in on mother who fakes a broad smile and holds a purple box of 'All Natural Cherokee Hair Tampons' with a Native woman that looks like the Land O' Lakes butter symbol] 
Cherokee hair tampons. 
[Broadens her fake smile]."
2006,4,6,Female announcer,"[Speaking like an authority] 
A cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid. 
[Scene slides over to another petri dish with tampon in front of box where the hand pours blue liquid on that tampon that swells more slowly] 
Other tampons also come up short. 
[Scene slides right again to a Cherokee woman laying on the table with her hair spread flat along the table]
But Cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful 
[The hand pours dyed blue water along the Cherokee woman's splayed hair, which doesn't absorb any of it, while the woman looks up at her hair]
Each tampon is hand woven 
[A white woman's manicured hand holds up a hair 'tampon' bundle up with cross-hatched orange yarn, bead wrapped center and a white pull string for extraction] 
from over 200 strands of Cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads."
2007,4,6,Daughter,You were right mom! All natural Cherokee hair tampons really did the trick. [Mother smiles back fakely and continues working]
2008,4,6,Mother,"And when you're done using them [She holds up Cherokee tampon] they make a great toy for Jessie. [Mother and daughter smile broad, fake smiles] Go get it boy! [Mother tosses Cherokee tampon off camera]"
2009,4,6,Jessie,"[Tampon flies into the grass where Jessie, the white terrier grabs it and shakes it] Grrr... grrrr"
2010,4,6,Chief Running Pinto Tommy Chong in his stoner voice,"[Camera shows mother and daughter smiling huge, fake smiles with their arms about each other peering into each other's face with the text 'Cherokee Hair Tampons' on the screen below.  Mother mouths 'I love you'] Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons."
2011,4,6,Eric Cartman,No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
2012,4,6,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Okay, it's clear. [slowly opens the front door] Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy."
2013,4,6,Timmy Burch,Timmiihh!
2014,4,6,Stan Marsh,Sshhh!
2015,4,6,Timmy Burch,[whispering] Timmiihh.
2016,4,6,Stan Marsh,"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?"
2017,4,6,Kenny McCormick,(Okay)
2018,4,6,Timmy Burch,[softly] Timmiihh.
2019,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Alright Butters, let's go. [they walk away and up the stairs, then down the hall, but Stan stops in his tracks] Uh-oh, Cartman's pig. [Fluffy is seen sleeping in her own little bed. Stan and Butters try to sneak past, but she opens her eyes] Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay. [Butters accidentally steps on Fluffy's tail and she squeals in panic. This wakes Cartman, who blinks and heads for his door half-asleep] Come on, we gotta get outta here! [runs a bit, then has his back to the wall as Cartman opens the door and walks out] Oh, no!"
2020,4,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh well, we're busted. [Cartman continues towards Fluffy, Ignoring the boys]"
2021,4,6,Eric Cartman,"[smacks her] Shut up, Fluffy! [she quiets down and Cartman goes back to sleep, closing his door.]"
2022,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh, phew."
2023,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! [Stan rises from the other side of the bed with the medical book, and Butters rises, too]"
2024,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, here we go. [opens the book and leafs through. Pictures of the heart, fingers, liver, and cutaway of the male genitalia are shown. Stan giggles softly and turns the page to a picture of the kidney] Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here..."
2025,4,6,Butters Stotch,I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
2026,4,6,Stan Marsh,"...vein right, well- [brings out the saw] Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. [Butters pulls the sheets, Stan the shirt, and something more is in their way] No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!"
2027,4,6,Eric Cartman,"[rises quickly] whatwhatwhatwhat? [sees Stan and Butters] Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!"
2028,4,6,Stan Marsh,"You suck, Cartman!"
2029,4,6,Eric Cartman,"[faces them] Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!"
2030,4,6,Stan Marsh,"God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!"
2031,4,6,Eric Cartman,I do! I do care! Look how much. [a blank expression is on his face] Look. Look how much I care. [the expressionless face persists]
2032,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,"First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance."
2033,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Yeahyeahyeah. So, did you read the book?"
2034,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,"Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book. [taps on it a few times]"
2035,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Well, what did you think?"
2036,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,"Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you."
2037,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Ooohhh, why not??"
2038,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,"Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word ""penis"" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?"
2039,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel."
2040,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,"Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a ""romance novel."""
2041,4,6,Mr Garrison,No?
2042,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,"[clears his throat] No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay."
2043,4,6,Mr Garrison,What the hell are you talkin' about?!
2044,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.
2045,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!"
2046,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,It is.
2047,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs! [the publisher has no answer] Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!"
2048,4,6,A Harequin Romance Publisher,[taps his chin] Hmmm.
2049,4,6,Stan Marsh,"[despondent, voice cracking] There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!"
2050,4,6,Kenny McCormick,(You never seem to care when I die!)
2051,4,6,Stan Marsh,"[sobs] My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it. [begins to break down] Oh, God, he's my best friend... [weeps]"
2052,4,6,Kenny McCormick,"[stands up] (Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) [walks away. Above him, a man is hauling a piano, but realizes the ropes are tearing]"
2053,4,6,Mover,Look out! [the piano snaps from the ropes and crushes Kenny] Oops.
2054,4,6,Stan Marsh,Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! [weeps]
2055,4,6,Mrs Tucker,"Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please."
2056,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"[hands them to her] No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front. [she walks away with the tampons and Carlos glances at her ass]"
2057,4,6,Man 7,"Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1."
2058,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,"Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice. [the man takes it and drinks. Carlos and Chief Pinto chortle]"
2059,4,6,Man 7,"Wow, I feel better already! [walks away. Carlos and Chief Pinto laugh some more.]"
2060,4,6,Miss Information,[joining the two men] And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son. [Sheila drags Kyle in by his jacket collar]
2061,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"[let's him drop to the floor] Okay, here he is."
2062,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"Ahahem, that kid looks really sick."
2063,4,6,Miss Information,Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.
2064,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor."
2065,4,6,Customers,[look at each other] Hmm?
2066,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,But you're more in touch with the earth.
2067,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man."
2068,4,6,Sharon Marsh,It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. [Carlos and Chief Pinto look at each other. Kyle groans]
2069,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,"No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican."
2070,4,6,Customers,What?!
2071,4,6,Man,Hu-uh?!
2072,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,Yeah. A Mexican.
2073,4,6,Man 7,"Uugh. [spits out the ball juice] Ptu, ptu."
2074,4,6,Man 8,I didn't know that.
2075,4,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh my God! [Mrs.Tucker, who had purchased the 48 tampons screams in horror and covers her crotch area)"
2076,4,6,Sharon Marsh,How dare you deceive us like that!
2077,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that."
2078,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,"Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans. [the customers blink in anger, then gather around Miss Information]"
2079,4,6,Miss Information,"Uh, toxins are your enemy. [the customers enclose her]"
2080,4,6,Woman 1,Kill her! [the pummeling begins. Carlos and Chief Pinto just laugh at the sight]
2081,4,6,Carlos Ramirez,Funny.
2082,4,6,Stan Marsh,So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
2083,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!"
2084,4,6,Stan Marsh,"That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan."
2085,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA! [jumps back. His Kidney Blocker 2000 lies at the foot of his bed over streaks of blood] That son of a bitch!"
2086,4,6,Eric Cartman,"[fuming] Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!"
2087,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, please. Kyle needs it."
2088,4,6,Eric Cartman,"It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!"
2089,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Alright, alright, here. [hands him a bloody kidney. Cartman reviews it.]"
2090,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before."
2091,4,6,Nurse,"[over an intercom] Doctor, Eric Cartman is here- [Cartman enters unbid before she finishes speaking]"
2092,4,6,Dr Doctor,"Why, hello there, Eric. [Cartman stands on the chair and slaps the kidney down on the desk. The doctor looks on]"
2093,4,6,Eric Cartman,"You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in! [sits] Please."
2094,4,6,Dr Doctor,"Oh, I see. [holds the kidney up] Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?"
2095,4,6,Eric Cartman,"No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!"
2096,4,6,Dr Doctor,"Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery. [puts the kidney down and holds up a clipboard] If you'll just sign this release. [sets it in front of Cartman]"
2097,4,6,Eric Cartman,Thank you. [signs the release form]
2098,4,6,Sheila Broflovski,"How are you feeling, boubbie?"
2099,4,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Better, thanks."
2100,4,6,Stan Marsh,You look a lot better.
2101,4,6,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick."
2102,4,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan."
2103,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do."
2104,4,6,Chief Running Pinto,"Yeah. [to Cartman] Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too."
2105,4,6,Eric Cartman,"[wakes up] Heh. Hey, what what's going on?"
2106,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!"
2107,4,6,Eric Cartman,Huh?
2108,4,6,Stan Marsh,"It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney."
2109,4,6,Dr Doctor,"Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release."
2110,4,6,Liane Cartman,"Isn't that funny, sweetie?"
2111,4,6,Eric Cartman,Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
2112,4,6,Mr Garrison,"[enters the room and walks to Kyle's bed] Oh, here's everybody. [in his hand is a book]"
2113,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?"
2114,4,6,Mr Garrison,"Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. [hands the book to Kyle, who looks at it]"
2115,4,6,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. ...Thanks?
2116,4,6,Eric Cartman,[livid] I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
2117,4,6,Stan Marsh,"Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. [laughs a long time with Kyle]"
2118,4,6,Kyle Broflovski,[white liquid spurts out his nose] Huh? [covers his nose] What the?
2119,4,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh good, you got the crappy kidney."
2120,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?"
2121,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"Mayor, it's about the South Park flag."
2122,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"[instantly exasperated] Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!"
2123,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!"
2124,4,7,Chef,"Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!"
2125,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!"
2126,4,7,Chef,That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
2127,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag. [the one with the bang goes to get it] and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. [the assistant returns and gives one end to Johnson. They unfurl the flag between them. The flag shows a black figure dangling from a hangman's noose, and two white figures on either side of him rejoicing. ""South Park"" is written underneath]"
2128,4,7,Chef,You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
2129,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?"
2130,4,7,Chef,Yeah!
2131,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"No, because it's their history!"
2132,4,7,Chef,"Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you [points to the mayor and emphasizes], THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!"
2133,4,7,Jimbo Kern,And I'm telling you it WON'T!
2134,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"[rolls her eyes] Oh, boy."
2135,4,7,Mr Wyland,"Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club."
2136,4,7,Class,[Timmy stays quiet] Aaaaah!
2137,4,7,Mr Wyland,"I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year. [points to a chart with three debates on it] Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been… Cartman."
2138,4,7,Eric Cartman,Thaaat's ri-ight.
2139,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
2140,4,7,Class,[including Timmy] Yeah.
2141,4,7,Eric Cartman,Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
2142,4,7,Stan Marsh,You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
2143,4,7,Eric Cartman,Yes I do!
2144,4,7,Craig Tucker,No you don't!
2145,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! [rises from his seat, heads for the door, and exits]"
2146,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,Told ya.
2147,4,7,Mr Wyland,"Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on. [the class stares back blankly]"
2148,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"This is about history, kids. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and two others are present] If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD! [he and Ned each take a shot at it, and it tumbles away, falling dead into a large pile of dead birds on the road behind the boys] -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not [does quotes with his left index and middle finger] ""politically correct."" Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL! [He and Ned take shots at it, and it falls dead from its branch] And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?"
2149,4,7,Ned Gerblansky,"Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-"
2150,4,7,Stan Marsh,"Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it."
2151,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we got it."
2152,4,7,Jimbo Kern,You sure?
2153,4,7,Stan Marsh,Yup.
2154,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yup.
2155,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson! [he and Ned fire away, and Chris yells and dodges the bullets, then runs off] God-damnit, we missed him again!"
2156,4,7,Chef,"Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag! [the shoppers brush on by and enter the store, and the doors close] You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved! [the doors open and Randy Marsh walks out with a bag of groceries. Chef notices] Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?"
2157,4,7,Randy Marsh,"Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag."
2158,4,7,Chef,"Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion. [Randy walks away and Chef looks at the kids] That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!"
2159,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"We'll march with you, Chef."
2160,4,7,Chef,"That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters. [Mr. Mackey walks out with some groceries. Chef stops him] Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?"
2161,4,7,Mr Mackey,"Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon."
2162,4,7,Chef,"Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?"
2163,4,7,Principal Victoria,"[arrives] Thursday's no good, we've got choir council."
2164,4,7,Mr Mackey,"Oh, yeah."
2165,4,7,Principal Victoria,What about next Sunday?
2166,4,7,Chef,Fine! Next Sunday!
2167,4,7,Man 1,"You mean, during the ball game?"
2168,4,7,Man 2,"Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday."
2169,4,7,Chef,Monday??
2170,4,7,Principal Victoria,"Oh, I can't do Monday."
2171,4,7,Man 3,[arrives] I could do Tuesday.
2172,4,7,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, Tuesday morning's good."
2173,4,7,Man 1,You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
2174,4,7,Man 2,Saturday is perfect for me.
2175,4,7,Principal Victoria,Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?
2176,4,7,Man 3,Mm hmm.
2177,4,7,Man 2,Yeah.
2178,4,7,Woman 2,Yeah.
2179,4,7,Man 1,Yeah.
2180,4,7,Man 3,That sounds good.
2181,4,7,Man 2,Mm hmm.
2182,4,7,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, I think that's the best day."
2183,4,7,Chef,"Okay! On Saturday, we march!"
2184,4,7,Man 2,"Oh, march? What are we marching for?"
2185,4,7,Chef,To bring down the South Park Flag!
2186,4,7,Man 2,…Oh. [the adults begin to disperse]
2187,4,7,Man 3,"Oohh, I gotta go."
2188,4,7,Man 1,I know what I may like. I don't like marching
2189,4,7,Woman 2,"Uh, marching's really not for me."
2190,4,7,Man 2,See you later.
2191,4,7,Mr Wyland,"Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed."
2192,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
2193,4,7,Mr Wyland,"Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the ""Flag Should Stay The Way It Is"" team?"
2194,4,7,Stan Marsh,Me. Me. Me. Me.
2195,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,Me. Me. Me. Me.
2196,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,[upset] Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!
2197,4,7,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag."
2198,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, me neither."
2199,4,7,Mr Wyland,"Alright. Stan and Kyle, [turns and writes on the board] you can both be the team leaders for the ""Flag should stay the way it is"" team. [turns around. Their names are there now] Now, who wants to lead the ""Flag should be changed"" team? [an angry Wendy raises her hand. Cartman looks over at her, then raises his hand and chuckles] Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up. [writes their names on the board]"
2200,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,[mortified] Nooo! [Cartman chuckles some more]
2201,4,7,Mr Wyland,"Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!"
2202,4,7,Stan Marsh,"Hello, Chef."
2203,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello, Chef."
2204,4,7,Chef,"[in a foul mood] My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam."
2205,4,7,Stan Marsh,Islam??
2206,4,7,Chef,"From now on, my name is [points to his apron] Abdul Mohammed Jabar [points to the rest of his name on a sign held by an Arab assistant] Rauf Kareem Ali. [proceeds with preparing the trays] With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!"
2207,4,7,Stan Marsh,"Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed."
2208,4,7,Chef,You WHAT?! [plants his fists on the counter while the assistant struggles to keep his half of the  name sign in line with Chef's apron] You don't think they should change the flag?!
2209,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,Not really.
2210,4,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is."
2211,4,7,Chef,"[moves to his right and sets the ladle and a pot down] Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!"
2212,4,7,Stan Marsh,"But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about."
2213,4,7,Chef,"But nothin'! [picks up the ladle and throws it down] ""But"" my ass! Fix your own damn food! [hurries out, and his assistant quickly follows. Stan and Kyle look at each other, confused]"
2214,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-"
2215,4,7,Eric Cartman,"[enters] It's okay, I'm here."
2216,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,[glares at him for a few seconds] Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
2217,4,7,Eric Cartman,"[begins pacing] Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility."
2218,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,[stunned] What??
2219,4,7,Eric Cartman,"That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility! [starts barking orders] Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever."
2220,4,7,Butters Stotch,Wwuhuh-o-kay! [hops off his chair. Wendy watches him leave]
2221,4,7,Eric Cartman,"The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy."
2222,4,7,Clyde,"Right. [the others disperse, leaving Wendy and Cartman facing each other at the round table.]"
2223,4,7,Eric Cartman,[takes out some Cheesy Poofs] Mmmm.
2224,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[walks up to him] Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate."
2225,4,7,Eric Cartman,"You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?"
2226,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,The South Park flag!
2227,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?"
2228,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,D'aaaaahhh!
2229,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Whoa! Calm down, ho. [eats some poofs]"
2230,4,7,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"[""NEWS 4 LIVE!""] Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered."
2231,4,7,Chef,Change the flag!
2232,4,7,Jimbo Kern,Don't change history!
2233,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh brother, what now?!"
2234,4,7,Chef,"[background, as the reporter speaks] Change the flag! Change the flag!…"
2235,4,7,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced their opinion."
2236,4,7,Man 4,"[angry] Well, I think the flag is racist! [turns pensive] Huh, but then again, it is part of our history."
2237,4,7,Man 5,"Well, I guess the flag is part of history, …but I can see how it is racist."
2238,4,7,Man 6,"[flatly, slowly] I think it is history. I think it is racist."
2239,4,7,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something."
2240,4,7,Chef,"[background, as the reporter speaks] …Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! [the mayor simply looks down] In the 1960s there was a monk [shows a photo of Thích Quảng Đức in flames] who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice! [lowers the photo] To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! [raises a portable gas tank and a lighter, then pours the gasoline on a Tibetan monk and sets him on fire]"
2241,4,7,A Monk,[in flames] Huh! Haaaaaaaaaaaah! [dies]
2242,4,7,The KKK and their leader,[arriving] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
2243,4,7,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"[stunned, then speaks] What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion."
2244,4,7,KKK Leader,"[walks up to Jimbo and extends his hand.] Hello, brother. [Jimbo and his group turns to see the Klan] We are here to support your noble cause."
2245,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history."
2246,4,7,Ned Gerblansky,Yeah.
2247,4,7,KKK Leader,"Well, whether you want our support or not, we're on your side! [he and the rest of the KKK face right and march away]"
2248,4,7,The KKK and their leader,"White Power! White Power! [Jimbo and the others watch them leave] White Power! White Power! [they take up positions in front of City Hall, facing Chef. A familiar figure is chanting with them] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!"
2249,4,7,Sheila Broflovski,"[arrives] Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?"
2250,4,7,Mr Garrison,"NO, no, [steps out] but Mr. Hat is. [points to the puppet, which is dressed in a Klan robe and bends down a few times as if to say ""hello""]"
2251,4,7,Mr Garrison,[Voicing Mr. Hat] White Power! White Power!
2252,4,7,Mr Garrison,"Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat."
2253,4,7,The KKK and their leader,White Power!
2254,4,7,Chef,Change the flag!
2255,4,7,Jimbo Kern,Don't change history!
2256,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Ooh, Jesus. What a mess."
2257,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case. [shot of an angry Chef] We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen? [her assistants lift up a flag and carry it to a clear area, then unfurl it for Chef to see] There. Is that better? [It looks the same…]"
2258,4,7,Chef,"No, damnit!"
2259,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"[points to the black figure] No, but look! He's got a little smile now! [a close-up reveals closed eyes and a smile] See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think? [Chef just rises and walks out. The mayor lumps in her chair] Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?"
2260,4,7,Johnson,"Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday."
2261,4,7,Assistant,We… could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.
2262,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!"
2263,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-"
2264,4,7,Eric Cartman,"I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone![as Bog Monster] O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!"
2265,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
2266,4,7,Eric Cartman,[as Captain Candycone] Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts![as Bog Monster] Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts![as Captain Candycone] I'll kick you in the nuts!
2267,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!"
2268,4,7,Eric Cartman,You won't let me help.
2269,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!"
2270,4,7,Eric Cartman,"[thinks a moment…] …Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it. [Wendy remains mad at him. He does Bog Monster] Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih. [she averts her gaze, then breaks into a smile] Wendih. Seriouslih. [she chuckles] The Bog Monster speaketh."
2271,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want. [Kenny chows down tablets from a blue bowl before him] Who wants to read them? [no one responds]"
2272,4,7,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!"
2273,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!"
2274,4,7,Kenny McCormick,(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)
2275,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner."
2276,4,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Ah, fuck you!) [gives him the finger]"
2277,4,7,Stan Marsh,"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side."
2278,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend."
2279,4,7,Kenny McCormick,"[burps] (Hey, can I have a drink of water?)"
2280,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. [Kenny hops off and walks to the dispenser]"
2281,4,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. [Mr. Broflovski enters]"
2282,4,7,Gerald Broflovski,"[stops behind Kenny's chair] Hey, boys, how's the research coming?"
2283,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Pretty good, I guess."
2284,4,7,Stan Marsh,Do you think they should change the flag?
2285,4,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, uuhh. I don't know. [picks up the empty bowl]"
2286,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny ate all the mints, dad."
2287,4,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets."
2288,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh.
2289,4,7,Stan Marsh,Kenny! [Mr. Broflovski looks in anticipation]
2290,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! [Mr. Broflovski looks in anticipation]
2291,4,7,Kenny McCormick,"[drinks the water, then looks at them] (What?) [the tablets start to fizz] (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!) [as his voice rises, his body balloons and foam comes out of all possible orifices. Then he bursts and parts of him fall all over. Some antacid squirts out of somewhere. At the table, body parts and antacid cover some books, parts of the table, and on parts of everyone left. The other students and Mr. Broflovski laugh. Stan and Kyle clap somewhat]"
2292,4,7,Stan Marsh,That was a good one.
2293,4,7,The KKK and their leader,White Power! White Power!
2294,4,7,KKK Leader,Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power!
2295,4,7,The KKK and their leader,White Power!
2296,4,7,Mr Garrison,"[now next to the leader] Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch."
2297,4,7,Mr Garrison,[Voicing Mr. Hat] Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!
2298,4,7,Mr Garrison,[shocked] Dugh! [covers his mouth. Chef looks at him an angry disbelief] Ogh. Waaaaah! [runs away]
2299,4,7,Chef,[approaches one group] How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
2300,4,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking."
2301,4,7,Channel 4 Field Reporter,Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think.
2302,4,7,Man 7,"Well, I think they are racist, but I… do think freedom of speech is important."
2303,4,7,Man 8,"Well, I, for one, believe in freedom of speech. …Mmm but then again, I think they are racist."
2304,4,7,Man 9,"Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all-"
2305,4,7,Chef,"[shoves the man out of the way] Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards!"
2306,4,7,Channel 4 Field Reporter,"On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. [Results show on screen in text beside him]Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids!"
2307,4,7,KKK Leader,"Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!"
2308,4,7,The KKK and their leader,Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower! [they march away]
2309,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"[to Ned] Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them."
2310,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote."
2311,4,7,Eric Cartman,[aloof] Uh huh.
2312,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument."
2313,4,7,Eric Cartman,Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
2314,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,Huh?
2315,4,7,Eric Cartman,"I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it."
2316,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[mulls over the argument] Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman."
2317,4,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
2318,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. [takes a cookie]
2319,4,7,Eric Cartman,Cool.
2320,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. [starts eating]
2321,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs."""
2322,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, that's what I always do, too!"
2323,4,7,Eric Cartman,No way!
2324,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman."
2325,4,7,Eric Cartman,Me neither. [Romantic music starts to play]
2326,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,Aha ha.
2327,4,7,Eric Cartman,Huh.
2328,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, anyway, let's get back to work. [two kids speak in unison]"
2329,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, anyway, let's get back to work. [two kids speak in unison]"
2330,4,7,Eric Cartman,Whoa.
2331,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag. [reaches for a cookie] We can show that the- [Cartman's hand rests on hers. Their eyes meet and the music crescendos]"
2332,4,7,Eric Cartman,"[withdraws his hand] Ur, s-sorry. [shoves the plate to her a bit] Go ahead."
2333,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"No. [shoves the plate back, Music fades.] You go ahead."
2334,4,7,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?"
2335,4,7,Mr Garrison,[Voices Mr. Hat] There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
2336,4,7,Mr Garrison,"Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting."
2337,4,7,Mr Garrison,[Voices Mr. Hat] But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
2338,4,7,Mr Garrison,"Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!"
2339,4,7,Mr Garrison,[Voices Mr. Hat] I'm going whether you like it or not!
2340,4,7,Mr Garrison,"Oh yeah?! [sits in his armchair and waits] I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final! [looks away] Let's just see you try and go without me! [looks back again, and his right hand is bare] Mi-Mr. Hat?"
2341,4,7,The KKK and their leader,White Power! White Power! White Power! [Jimbo and Ned rise up out of the brush and look at the rally] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
2342,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"[softly, during the rally] Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with."
2343,4,7,Ned Gerblansky,Mmm-okay.
2344,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?"
2345,4,7,Ned Gerblansky,No.
2346,4,7,The KKK and their leader,White Power! White Power!
2347,4,7,KKK Leader,"[walks in and stands in front of the burning cross, raising his arms to quiet the group] Good evening, brothers. Our first order of business tonight is to have Brother Anderson update us on last week's minutes."
2348,4,7,Brother Anderson,Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!
2349,4,7,KKK Leader,"Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, and… do our cake raffle."
2350,4,7,KKK Members,"[ad lib] Oh, cake raffle. [Jimbo and Ned look at each other]"
2351,4,7,KKK Leader,"This week's winner is… [reads the ticket] uh, 2 9 7 4."
2352,4,7,Ticket 2974 Holder,"[jumps for joy] I won, I won. [moves forward] I won the cake! [takes it and returns to his place]"
2353,4,7,KKK Leader,"God job, brother. [smattering of applause. Jimbo and Ned look on.]"
2354,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[turns and runs to him] Cartman! [Cartman gets off the steed and runs to Wendy, his hair billowing in the wind]"
2355,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Ahh! [they run into each other's arms and tumble down, laughing all the while. At the bottom, Wendy's on her back and Cartman is on top of her]"
2356,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,Say it'll be like this forever.
2357,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, It will be like this forever."
2358,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh, Cartman! [Cartman looks at her, his hair billowing in the wind]"
2359,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"AAAAAAaaaah! [pants heavily, then dunks her head in the fish bowl on the little desk next to her bed.] Brrrrr. What's wrong with me? [hops down and heads for the bathroom, flips the lights on, goes to the sink, hops on a stool, and checks out her tongue and eyes, while Russel Crowe poster behind her stares on] Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. [hops down and heads for the switch. She's about to turn off the lights when a voice stops her]"
2360,4,7,Cartman s voice,Wendih. [she looks at the Russell Crowe poster next to the switch] Wendih. [Rusell's face stretches into one of Cartman]
2361,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,[shocked at the hallucination] Aaaah!
2362,4,7,Cartman s voice,"[the face reverts to Russell's as the voice fades] Wendih, look at me."
2363,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[turns around, looks up, then sits down with her face in her hands] Oh God, please don't let this be happening."
2364,4,7,KKK Leader,"Alright brothers, listen up! [two more members looking suspiciously familiar show up, and the leader starts to pace back and forth] As you know, this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag. But lynching minorities is history! So what are we gonna do about it?!"
2365,4,7,Member 1,"Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol!"
2366,4,7,KKK Members,Yeah!
2367,4,7,Member 2,"Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town!"
2368,4,7,KKK Members,Yeah!
2369,4,7,Jimbo Kern,[in KKK disguise] Let's say they should change the flag!
2370,4,7,KKK Members,Yeah! [turn to see the new member] Wah?
2371,4,7,KKK Leader,"Uh what's that, brother?"
2372,4,7,Jimbo Kern,I think we should switch sides!
2373,4,7,Ned Gerblansky,Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.
2374,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?"
2375,4,7,KKK Members,"[rolling reaction] Yeah, m-hm."
2376,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?"
2377,4,7,KKK Members,"[rolling reaction] Right, yeah."
2378,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is."
2379,4,7,KKK Leader,"That's a great idea, brother!"
2380,4,7,KKK Members,"[jubilant, jumping] Yeah!"
2381,4,7,KKK Leader,"Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us!"
2382,4,7,KKK Members,"[ad lib] Hooray, yeah! [the two new members leave]"
2383,4,7,A Member,We're smart! [the two members head into the brush]
2384,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"[both members take off their hoods] That worked perfectly, Ned."
2385,4,7,KKK Leader,"Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, ""Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?"""
2386,4,7,KKK Members,"[ad lib] Yeah, woohoo! [a member walks up to an organ and sits. He begins to play ""If You're Happy And You Know It…"" The rest form two lines and clap.]"
2387,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"[Watching from the bushes with their hoods now off]Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts."
2388,4,7,Ned Gerblansky,Mm-yup.
2389,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"[stops] That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy? [some headlights pass over them and they shield their eyes. A station wagon rolls up with Chef behind the wheel.  Jimbo waves hello.] Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess. [Chef glowers at them for a few seconds.  Dramatic music plays.] Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!"
2390,4,7,Chef,I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! [peels off. Mud flies behind the Town & Country and splatters Jimbo and Ned]
2391,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes."
2392,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[leads Bebe in] Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you."
2393,4,7,Bebe Stevens,"Sure, what?"
2394,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman."
2395,4,7,Bebe Stevens,[shrieks and covers her ears] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
2396,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,[ashamed] I know.
2397,4,7,Bebe Stevens,Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
2398,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-"
2399,4,7,Bebe Stevens,"Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, ""sexual tension."" Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with."
2400,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"You mean, I should kiss him? [looks away embarrassed]"
2401,4,7,Bebe Stevens,Kiss him and get it out of your system.
2402,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,[dreading] Oh God.
2403,4,7,Mr Wyland,"Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club. [the bleachers are shown. The mayor, Chef, Jimbo and Ned, and others are present] I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the ""Flag Should Be Changed"" team. [Wendy hops off her seat, then looks at Cartman and strokes her chin, then steps up to look at the audience. She looks again at Cartman. He's been watching her all the while, wondering where this is all headed]"
2404,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[Piano music implying a pending dramatic moment approaches. Wendy looks at the audience] The- [looks at Cartman] the- uh, [clears her throat] aheh ahum, [looks at Cartman] the… the- uh, [closes her eyes and pushes her hands out as if to push away the feelings swirling within] Ahhhhh, [exhales softly, then sighs] The first argument we- [her eyes snap back to Cartman, who's still watching her. Stan and Kyle watch as well] ah… [resets] Let me start over. [looks at Stan] The uh- [loses her rudder] oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment? [steps down and kisses a surprised Cartman full on the lips while she makes high pitched, humming sounds] Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee..."
2405,4,7,People in Audience,[ad lib] Oh. [Stan's jaw drops]
2406,4,7,Really Shocked Man,"[off camera] Oh, God! [Butters' and Token's jaws drop. So does Chef's. Wendy finally releases the pucker, sighs in happy relief, and goes back to the podium]"
2407,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[confident now] There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. [steps down as people clap. Stan is still in shock that Wendy kissed Cartman. She sits down, Cartman looks at her, then places his hands behind his head in a supreme air of confidence and looks away]"
2408,4,7,Mr Wyland,"Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point? [Kyle moves to the podium while Stan remains stunned]"
2409,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill. [an astonished Stan looks as Cartman puts his right hand on the back of Wendy's chair and points at her with his left, winks, then does a victory hand dance. A smiling Wendy remains oblivious to this showing off] And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. [returns to his seat amid a smattering of applause]"
2410,4,7,Chef,[stands up] Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
2411,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
2412,4,7,Chef,"I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!"
2413,4,7,Kyle s Team,[minus Stan who's mouth is still hanging open as he stares at Wendy] Racist??
2414,4,7,Chef,"Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people."
2415,4,7,Kyle s Team,[minus Stan still shocked] Ooooooohhh.
2416,4,7,Chef,Ooooooohhh?!
2417,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,W-we really didn't see it that way.
2418,4,7,Chef,But that's a black man up there!
2419,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter."
2420,4,7,Chef,"Well of course it matters when- [catches himself] …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?"
2421,4,7,Kyle s Team,[except stunned Stan] No.
2422,4,7,Chef,"[deducing, marveling] Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard."
2423,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,What?
2424,4,7,Mr Wyland,What?
2425,4,7,Chef,"Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people."
2426,4,7,A Few People,Awww.
2427,4,7,Some KKK members,Awww.
2428,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [Cartman is still showing off, Wendy remains oblivious, Stan remains shocked]"
2429,4,7,Chef,"I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist."
2430,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef."
2431,4,7,Chef,"Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man."
2432,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with."
2433,4,7,Chef,I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
2434,4,7,Audience Members,"[relieved, ad lib] Ooh, huhuh. Oooh [Stan's astonished gaze was fixed on Cartman and Wendy all that time while Cartman continued his happy hand dance.]"
2435,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now. [waves his hand in front of Stan to get his attention] Stan?"
2436,4,7,Mayor McDaniels,"This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week. [shot of the crowd, some of them smiling] Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! [The curtain falls away to reveal the same flag, only with the five people, including the hanged man, holding hands. The crowd cheers. From left to right: a white man, a yellow man, the hanged black man, a red man, and another black man]"
2437,4,7,Stan Marsh,"[recovered, looks at the flag] Wait, I don't get it."
2438,4,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist."
2439,4,7,Chef,Hooray!
2440,4,7,Jimbo Kern,"I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer."
2441,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. [the applause begins to die down]
2442,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Me, too!"
2443,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[applause stops, background music plays] I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished."
2444,4,7,Eric Cartman,"[fronting] Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh."
2445,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,I'm totally back to normal. See you later. [the crowd disperses behind her as she pats Cartman's shoulder]
2446,4,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, [finger points at her] huhuh, he, haha."
2447,4,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Hahaha. [looks off to her right] Stan. Stan, wait up! [hurries away to catch up to him. Cartman looks at her, then away, then at her long, then away, than at her quick one last time, then looks down and sighs. He turns to his left and walks away, dejected]"
2448,4,8,Announcer,"Tonight, Stellar Productions presents the boy band of the decade! [women scream, jump, and shout. Signs saying, ""FINGERBANG RULES"" ""FINGER BANG"" ""WE LOVE FINGER BANG"" AND ""FINGER BANG 4EVER"" bob throughout the audience] It's Fingerbang, live from Madison Square Gardens! [the interior is shown, with cheering crowds. A heralding sound effect plays, and spotlights flicker around the stage. A burst of fireworks cues the music and the familiar silhouettes of four boys are shown on stage. A few women faint]"
2449,4,8,Fingerbang,"[the lights go on them, and it's the boys, dressed in white outfits. Their hats are all white, too. A green shirt indicates Kyle, a blue one Stan. Kenny wears an orange visor over his white hood. All wear headsets]
Fingerbang!
[they each spin towards the audience once, then stop]
Bang-bang!
Fingerbang-bang!
[they spin back to their first positions]
Bangbangbang!
[all step forward and do their routine]
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you ever-y night"
2450,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[steps forward for a solo bridge as the others sway back and forth]
And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl"
2451,4,8,Woman,"[as Cartman sings] Cartman, I want youuu!"
2452,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[continues] My... girrrrrrrl... [lifts up his shirt to show off the right breast—um, pec. The others turn to their right while maintaining their gaze and pointing their gun fingers at the audience. The music builds as women scream at the sight]"
2453,4,8,Fingerbang,"[Cartman rejoins the others and all point their gun fingers at the audience, then resume the routine]
Fingerbang!
Bang... Bang bang bang
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang!
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang--"
2454,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm-- [wakes up, then looks angry] Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-dammit! [suddenly thinks] Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! [rushes out of bed]"
2455,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[pacing back and forth] Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives. [stops and faces them] God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars."
2456,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,...How?
2457,4,8,Eric Cartman,Boy band.
2458,4,8,Stan Marsh,Boy band?
2459,4,8,Eric Cartman,Boy band.
2460,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not being in any [crosses his arms over his chest] faggy boy band!
2461,4,8,Eric Cartman,"There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!"
2462,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we don't have any musical talent."
2463,4,8,Eric Cartman,"That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass! [pulls out a tape from his back pocket] I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!"
2464,4,8,Kenny McCormick,(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
2465,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. [intense] So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--"
2466,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
2467,4,8,Eric Cartman,So?
2468,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"So, all boy bands have five members."
2469,4,8,Eric Cartman,What?
2470,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members."
2471,4,8,Stan Marsh,He's right.
2472,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[throws down the tape] Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!"
2473,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?"
2474,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, I guess."
2475,4,8,Sharon Marsh,What did you do?
2476,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. [Randy reacts, and Shelly takes notice]"
2477,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh well, that sounds nice."
2478,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[to Sharon, angrily] No, it does NOT  sound nice! [to Stan] Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band."
2479,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it."
2480,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[rises] If all your friends jumped off a cliff, [jabs his finger at Stan] would you do that too?"
2481,4,8,Stan Marsh,[voice shaking] Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
2482,4,8,Randy Marsh,"You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! [storms out]"
2483,4,8,Shelly Marsh,"Geez, what's up Dad's ass?"
2484,4,8,Butters Stotch,"[holds two fingers on his right hand up to indicate a hopping bunny]
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
[scoops up imaginary mice, makes two fists, and bops the right one with the left]
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
[shimmies down with hands outstretched. The auditors look half-asleep]
Down came a white angel and she said
[the angel (left finger) reprimands the bunny]
""Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
[the piano player seems familiar. The angle bops the bunny]
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head""
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF

Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head

2485,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[through the mic] Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know."
2486,4,8,Butters Stotch,"Ah, I can do it again."
2487,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[through the mic] We'll let you know, Butters."
2488,4,8,Butters Stotch,"Ahah-oo well, alright then. [walks off to his left, unsure]"
2489,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!"
2490,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,It was?
2491,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that."
2492,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better</> do it better than that. [into the mic] Next!"
2493,4,8,Stan Marsh,"[reads from a list] Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski."
2494,4,8,Eric Cartman,Kyle's brother?
2495,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,I promised my mom I'd let him try. [Ike hops in with some sheet music]
2496,4,8,Eric Cartman,Christ's sake..!
2497,4,8,Schroeder,What key?
2498,4,8,Ike,"[hands him the sheet]

2504,4,8,Ike,"When ah thanky you be 
One on a teacher on a palm tree"
2505,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[through the mic] Not the next song, the next PERSON! [Ike goes for his sheet music, then returns to flip Cartman off.] Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. [the front door opens and in walks Wendy with her sheet music. She walks to the piano player, gives it to him--]"
2506,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band! [a grinning Wendy suddenly frowns and her head hangs.]"
2507,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come on, dude. Let her try."
2508,4,8,Eric Cartman,[moves the mic away] No way!
2509,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!"

2513,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!"
2514,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, she's a chick!"
2515,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, nobody's gonna notice."
2516,4,8,Eric Cartman,"""Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! [Wendy looks down at her chest]"
2517,4,8,Stan Marsh,She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
2518,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
2519,4,8,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
2520,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!"
2521,4,8,Wendy Testaburger,[exults] Yeah!
2522,4,8,Eric Cartman,Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
2523,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?"
2524,4,8,Eric Cartman,"We have to rehearse all that we can! [moves away] Now, check this out: [returns with a box of clothes and sets it on the floor] My mom made us costumes!"
2525,4,8,Stan Marsh,Costumes? [the band gathers around the box]
2526,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. [starts handing out the costumes] This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... [she looks a little embarrassed]"
2527,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?"
2528,4,8,Eric Cartman,"'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough."
2529,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,[dryly] I wanna be the tough one.
2530,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[looks back blankly] ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--"
2531,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,[determined] I wanna be the tough one!
2532,4,8,Eric Cartman,"You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!"
2533,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Jews are tough!
2534,4,8,Eric Cartman,Since when?!
2535,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Since Abraham, fatass!"
2536,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, fine! Here! [tosses the tough costume at Kyle, knocking him down] Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! [moves away. The band dresses. Kenny is a baseball player, Stan is a fighter pilot, Cartman is an Elvis impersonator, Kyle is a tough dude with nose ring and Fu Manchu mustache]"
2537,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?"
2538,4,8,Eric Cartman,"I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... [waves his finger around] pretend to use your finger like a gun or something."
2539,4,8,Kenny McCormick,"[chuckling] (Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)"
2540,4,8,Stan Marsh,Kenny says that's not what it means.
2541,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[testy] Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?"
2542,4,8,Kenny McCormick,"(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)"
2543,4,8,Eric Cartman,"...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!"
2544,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"[with a drawl] Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous."
2545,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[leading the band members through the mall] Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!"
2546,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"[blocking the way to Mall Management] Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?"
2547,4,8,Eric Cartman,We're goin' to see the mall manager.
2548,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,Do you have the proper clearance?
2549,4,8,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Uh oh, mall cops."
2550,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir."
2551,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[pleading] But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, [the veteran guard pulls out a small bottle of pepper spray and shakes it up] so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--  [the veteran guard sprays his face all over] Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-dammit..! [squeezes his eyes shut and rubs them]"
2552,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ!
2553,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God, I can't see! [rubs his eyes]"
2554,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again. [Cartman walks off and the others join him. Stan retrieves the boom box. Then] You see, you put your life on the line every day."
2555,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager."
2556,4,8,Eric Cartman,[coughs a few times] The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! [all join him down the mall]
2557,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,Ey! [the man turns to look at him] What are you doin'?
2558,4,8,Man,Nothin'. Just... shopping.
2559,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Move along, sir. [the man leaves and the veteran looks at the rookie] You see, sometimes you gotta just do that. Keeps shoppers on their toes — try it. [the rookie gets determined and a woman and girl walk by]"
2560,4,8,Rookie Security Guard,Ey! [they turn to look at him] What are you doin'?
2561,4,8,Woman,Nothing. Why?
2562,4,8,Rookie Security Guard,"Move along, ma'am. [she leaves looking angry]"
2563,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.
2564,4,8,Rookie Security Guard,Cool.
2565,4,8,Eric Cartman,[over the PA system] Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. [crowds rush off to get their Nissans]
2566,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Jesus, they're gonna start a riot! [both cops follow the crowd while Cartman and friends return to the mall manager's office]"
2567,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, guys, here we go. [enters the office with the others] Hello, sir!"
2568,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"[a harried man who's speech is nearly emotionless with odd exclamations] What? Hey. Who are you? [the office is a bit unkempt. Stacks of paper here and there, hanging out of cabinet drawers, scraps on the floor and desk...]"
2569,4,8,Eric Cartman,We... are Fingerbang!
2570,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
2571,4,8,Eric Cartman,We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
2572,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
2573,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?"
2574,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?"
2575,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright! Let's do it, boys! [moves aside and sets the boom box down, then sets the tape to play. He returns to the group, and they begin. All of them are all off-key, They all sing too ahead of the music and Wendy's voice is squeaky and lags behind the others...]"
2576,4,8,Fingerbang,"I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night"
2577,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[goes into his solo, and back into his dream]
And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--"
2578,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"[cuts him off] Alright, that's enough!"
2579,4,8,Eric Cartman,"--you're my fantasy, you fanta--"
2580,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Thank you.
2581,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[backs up into the band] Well, so can we play here?"
2582,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,What?? ...No.
2583,4,8,Eric Cartman,No??
2584,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Who?? No!
2585,4,8,Eric Cartman,Why not?!
2586,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?"
2587,4,8,Eric Cartman,"You don't think we're any good, do you?!"
2588,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese."
2589,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. [goes to get his boom box]"
2590,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Wow. That was your best? [Cartman flashes an angry look at him, then walks off in a huff.]"
2591,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. I feel so rejected.
2592,4,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2593,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!
2594,4,8,Stan Marsh,Uh-oh.
2595,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
2596,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Run for it! [the five bolt and rush out of there]
2597,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Go get 'em, rookie! [gives the rookie a stern look; the rookie just looks back]"
2598,4,8,Randy Marsh,Where is Stan?
2599,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band."
2600,4,8,Randy Marsh,What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
2601,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it."
2602,4,8,Randy Marsh,"And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! [turns around and walks out]"
2603,4,8,Shelly Marsh,"Mom, what's up Dad's ass?"
2604,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now."
2605,4,8,Chef,"[opens the door and appears in a towel around his waist] Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric."
2606,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[eyes downcast] Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems."
2607,4,8,Chef,"Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. [a blonde woman comes up behind Chef]"
2608,4,8,Eric Cartman,I just don't know what I'm gonna do. [lets himself in] Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. [goes to the sofa and pulls out some Cheesy Poofs to eat]
2609,4,8,Chef,"[sits next to Cartman] Alright, Eric, what's the matter?"
2610,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, [with feeling] I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? [the woman sits on Chef's left side and strokes his arm]"
2611,4,8,Chef,"Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect."
2612,4,8,Eric Cartman,What's the Gomlich effect?
2613,4,8,Chef,"The law of physics that states, ""If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."""
2614,4,8,Eric Cartman,So how do boy bands use that?
2615,4,8,Chef,"All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy! [the blonde gets cross and scoots away; Chef quickly makes amends] Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. [she goes sweet on him again]"
2616,4,8,Eric Cartman,Thanks!
2617,4,8,Chef,"You're welcome. Now, go away!"
2618,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay. [Chef watches as Cartman drops down and heads for the front door, exits...]"
2619,4,8,Chef,A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
2620,4,8,Eric Cartman,[outside] Cucumber in the pants. Got it. [and closes the door]
2621,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?"
2622,4,8,Bebe Stevens and other girls,"Are we gonna get paid now, or after?"
2623,4,8,Eric Cartman,"I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. [Timmy sits in the cameraman's chair]"
2624,4,8,Timmy Burch,Tiimmmaaayyy! [Cartman inches his way to the group sideways]
2625,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what's wrong with your leg?"
2626,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. [the band walks across the ground in front of the girls]"
2627,4,8,Girls,[ad lib] Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.
2628,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!"
2629,4,8,Timmy Burch,Huhaaaaah!
2630,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!"
2631,4,8,Bebe Stevens and other girls,We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
2632,4,8,Other Girls Red,Yeah.
2633,4,8,Annie,Yeah.
2634,4,8,and Milly,Yeah.
2635,4,8,Eric Cartman,Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
2636,4,8,Girls,...Matt Lauer.
2637,4,8,Eric Cartman,"...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer."
2638,4,8,Bebe Stevens and other girls,Oh... Okay. [Cartman positions himself in front of them]
2639,4,8,Eric Cartman,Roll camera!
2640,4,8,Timmy Burch,Timmuh! [the band tries again]
2641,4,8,Girls,"AAAGGGGHHH! [the band scatters away from the screaming. Cartman falls, then gets up]"
2642,4,8,Eric Cartman,Jesus Christ!
2643,4,8,Fingerbang,Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
2644,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Aaand cut! [music stops] Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!"
2645,4,8,Bebe Stevens and other girls,"Okay, so where's our money?"
2646,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh uh, Kyle has it. [the girls move to Kyle. Cartman walks away]"
2647,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[arrives] Stanley, what the hell are you doing?"
2648,4,8,Stan Marsh,We are making a music video.
2649,4,8,Randy Marsh,You get in the truck right now! [points at it]
2650,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I was just a--"
2651,4,8,Randy Marsh,[pointing] Get in the truck! [Stan walks to the truck dejected]
2652,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?"
2653,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed."
2654,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting."
2655,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?"
2656,4,8,Stan Marsh,No.
2657,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, maybe it's time."
2658,4,8,Stan Marsh,Dad!
2659,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,Ey! What are you doin'?
2660,4,8,Madman,I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!
2661,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Move along, sir."
2662,4,8,Madman,Wuh? [walks away]
2663,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. [crowds of mall shoppers head for the orange smoothie machine]"
2664,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,God dammit! [he and the rookie give chase]
2665,4,8,Eric Cartman,[enters the manager's office] Hello again!
2666,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
2667,4,8,Eric Cartman,I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
2668,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Oh. What?
2669,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[retrieves a TV cart with VCR and pops the VCR in. The video pops up] If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! [at first, only the boys' hats are seen, near the play elephants. The camera spins right, then down, and the girls' feet are seen. The camera spins up and left, and finally rests on Timmy]"
2670,4,8,Timmy Burch,"Timmiihh! [The camera turns left again and catches a glimpse of the girls, then ends up on Cartman, and zooms in on the cucumber]"
2671,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. [the camera gets a glimpse of the four girls, then moves off them a second after Cartman appears]"
2672,4,8,Timmy Burch,"Haaghh. [waves at the camera, then moves his wheelchair back and dances to the music] Timmih, livin' a lie!"
2673,4,8,Eric Cartman,Son of a bitch!
2674,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Hey. This video is dumb.
2675,4,8,Eric Cartman,[dead air on tape] You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
2676,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side. [gives a warning face] For a little while."
2677,4,8,Eric Cartman,Really? You will?
2678,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Only for twenty minutes, though."
2679,4,8,Eric Cartman,That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
2680,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Oh. Okay. [static shows up on the video]
2681,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! [a previous recording is shown:]"
2682,4,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? [he's handcuffed against a brick wall. Mrs. Cartman appears as a dominatrix]"
2683,4,8,Liane Cartman,"You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. [points to it, then spreads her legs and pisses into it as he watches]"
2684,4,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? [Cartman is shocked at what he sees; the manager is pleased]"
2685,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw, Mom!"
2686,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Wow. What?
2687,4,8,Stan Marsh,"It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?"
2688,4,8,Randy Marsh,Because I said so!
2689,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me."
2690,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Let 'em be pissed off, then!"
2691,4,8,Stan Marsh,"I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--"
2692,4,8,Randy Marsh,"No!! [walks over to the china cabinet] NOOO!! [smashes his head through its glass doors, causing the dishes to slide out and break up. Stan is distraught, and Randy stands up, ashamed and shocked at his behavior. He walks back to Stan, then turns away defeated]"
2693,4,8,Stan Marsh,Dad? What the hell is going on?
2694,4,8,Randy Marsh,"...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver. [a flashback starts. A young Randy is at lower left corner of the choir, and the choir begins this song: ""Everything will wait / Weave all ye little reins...""] I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. [the audience claps. The producer is in the second row of spectators. The choir members split up and the producer rushes up to Randy]"
2695,4,8,Producer,"Kid, can I talk to you?"
2696,4,8,Randy Marsh,Uh sure.
2697,4,8,Producer,"Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town."
2698,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Ohh, thanks."
2699,4,8,Producer,Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
2700,4,8,Randy Marsh,What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
2701,4,8,Producer,"Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?"
2702,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--"
2703,4,8,Producer,"Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--"
2704,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[interrupting] No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it."
2705,4,8,Producer,I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. [slips a business card into Randy's coat pocket and pats it]
2706,4,8,Randy Marsh,And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
2707,4,8,Randy Marsh,[walks by Denver High] See ya. [walks away]
2708,4,8,Randy Marsh,...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
2709,4,8,Randy Marsh,"See ya. [waves, turns and walks away, leaving a distraught girl with mouth open]"
2710,4,8,Randy Marsh,...And I left my family.
2711,4,8,Randy Marsh,"See ya. [gets into his beat-up pale-yellow car and drives off, leaving his parents at the front door]"
2712,4,8,Randy Marsh,"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. [the five are recording their first song]"
2713,4,8,Producer,Take 112!
2714,4,8,Ghetto Avenue Boys,"You've... got... it!
You know you've got... it
[Randy: Girl]
What you've got is it!"
2715,4,8,Randy Marsh,"It's obvious to me, girl"
2716,4,8,Randy Marsh,"The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. [the song continues as he speaks, and the scene changes from the studio, to a poster, to a concert as the camera leaves the poster]"
2717,4,8,Ghetto Avenue Boys,"Shirl! You've... got... it!
It... is what you've got, girl!
What you've got is it!"
2718,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Now, give it to me, 'cause..."
2719,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[more scenes from his glory days] I had everything. A huge house, [the backyard pool: he's resting on an inflatable chaise longue while women surround him] and all the women you can imagine. [nine bikini-clad women are in his bed, and he's rolling back and forth over all of them] And then one day, just as quick as it started..."
2720,4,8,Mr Allens,"[the Ghetto Avenue Boys enter to rehearse, but...] Alright, guys, let's take it from the top."
2721,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Mr. Allens."
2722,4,8,Mr Allens,Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
2723,4,8,Randy Marsh,Who are they? [five new guys are in the recording booth]
2724,4,8,Mr Allens,"These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band."
2725,4,8,Randy Marsh,"But, w-we're still selling records, right?"
2726,4,8,Mr Allens,"Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band."
2727,4,8,Randy Marsh,I'm 19.
2728,4,8,Mr Allens,"Get a life, Marsh! [the Ghetto Avenue Boys turn around and walk out the door] Alright, guys, let's take it from the top."
2729,4,8,Randy Marsh,"They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car..."
2730,4,8,Tow Truck Driver,"[wearing a ""Tacos"" hat] See ya. [tows a blue sports car away]"
2731,4,8,Randy Marsh,...the women all left...
2732,4,8,Women,See ya. [the women pour out of bed and leave]
2733,4,8,Randy Marsh,...and they took back my house.
2734,4,8,Randy Marsh,[gets kicked out of the house] Ugh..! [the producer stands at the French doors]
2735,4,8,Mr Allens,See ya. [Randy gets up and walks away]
2736,4,8,Randy Marsh,"The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned."
2737,4,8,Woman,"Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?"
2738,4,8,Man,"Sure, I remember you! [starts mocking] You got it, baby... You got it, baby [he and the others begin to laugh, and it soon gets overwhelming. Randy looks around, scared. The flashback ends]"
2739,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[voice full of emotion] And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about."
2740,4,8,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
2741,4,8,Randy Marsh,"I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world. [Stan is listening] That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley. [bitterness creeps in] It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. [walks off]"
2742,4,8,Stan Marsh,[left with his thoughts] ...Oh-kay.
2743,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. [the band regroups]
2744,4,8,Eric Cartman,Where the hell is Stan?!
2745,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
2746,4,8,Eric Cartman,"I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!"
2747,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"[approaches] Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?"
2748,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member."
2749,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. [the cart is shown with Swiss cheese and sausage, and a pissed-off vendor]"
2750,4,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah. We'll start right away. [the manager walks away. Cartman turns to Kyle] We'll have to do it without him.
2751,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
2752,4,8,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
2753,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, god-dammit!"
2754,4,8,Stan Marsh,[enters] Dad?
2755,4,8,Randy Marsh,Huh? Yeah?
2756,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had."
2757,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[thinks, then lowers the magazine] Come here, Stanley. [Stan approaches and sits next to his dad] Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes."
2758,4,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2759,4,8,Randy Marsh,"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?"
2760,4,8,Stan Marsh,Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
2761,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall."
2762,4,8,Stan Marsh,Really?
2763,4,8,Randy Marsh,Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
2764,4,8,Stan Marsh,Alright! [father and son get up and leave the bedroom. Randy tosses his magazine aside]
2765,4,8,Man,What's happening here?
2766,4,8,Woman,"I don't know, uh. I guess nothing."
2767,4,8,Man,"Hm... Well, let's just walk away then. [man and woman leave]"
2768,4,8,Eric Cartman,God dammit! People are walking away! [drops back behind the curtain]
2769,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"[arrives again] Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart."
2770,4,8,Eric Cartman,Just another minute.
2771,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Sorry. Get out! [the band members walk sullenly away]
2772,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[stops and looks up] Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard."
2773,4,8,Wendy Testaburger,[rushes up to Cartman and points] What's that? [a grinning Randy and Stan arrive in an elevator]
2774,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,It's Stan! [the other members have returned]
2775,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! [walks off smiling as Stan arrives]"
2776,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where the hell have you been?!"
2777,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[approaches the manager] Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?"
2778,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up."
2779,4,8,Eric Cartman,"We will! [moves to the front of the stage and addresses the audience] Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall."" [the manager takes offense] And so, without further ado, all five members of the..."
2780,4,8,Kenny McCormick,"[while Cartman talks] (Uff--!) [an elevator crushes him and Cartman stops. Everyone around, including Cartman, is stunned. The doors open and the occupants exit]"
2781,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
2782,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
2783,4,8,Eric Cartman,[traumatized] No! He can't be dead!
2784,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he's pretty dead."
2785,4,8,Eric Cartman,No! We were so close!
2786,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!"
2787,4,8,Eric Cartman,But we have to perform!
2788,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!"
2789,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yes we do."
2790,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!"
2791,4,8,Fingerbang,"[the new fifth member: Randy]
Fingerbang!
Bang bang [audience members look at each other]
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang [people begin to leave]
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
[Janitors wearing face masks scrape Kenny's remains off the elevator]
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
[the veteran mall guard swivels his hips around happily as the rookie looks on]
I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
[Cartman: I'll just...]
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!"
2792,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Chuh! [only four shoppers remain to clap for them] Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!"
2793,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,We made two dollars.
2794,4,8,Stan Marsh,"You were great, Dad."
2795,4,8,Randy Marsh,Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
2796,4,8,Little Girl,Can I get your autograph?
2797,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Ok-Okay, okay."
2798,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"[arrives with the rookie and moves the girl aside] Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am."
2799,4,8,Little Girl,"[looks at the guard] I actually don't really know who they are, I was just getting an autograph and-- [the veteran guard sprays her with pepper] A-a-agg-g-ggh!"
2800,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Move along, ma'am. [the little girl runs off stage] Eh, that was pretty good, kids. Maybe you can come perform at my Elks Club sometime."
2801,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, yeah, maybe. [the mall cops walk away] God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us."
2802,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
2803,4,8,Eric Cartman,"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"""
2804,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
2805,4,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
2806,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[looks at Stan and pats him on the back] Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. [gets up and moves off the stage]"
2807,4,8,Stan Marsh,I don't think they sell those anymore. [gets up and follows his dad off; Wendy gets up and follows him]
2808,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? [gets up and follows the others off the stage. Cartman gets up and follows him]"
2809,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy. [the stage is empty now, but Cartman returns and looks up] You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. [turns and walks off again]"
2810,4,9,Congregation,"I walk hand-in-hand with Jesus
Over at the park by where he lives
I tell him all my problems
[the cantor is shown at the pulpit]
And sometimes he tells me his
What a friend I have in Jesus
[Stan, Kenny, and Cartman are shown]
I can say that honestly
[other townsfolk are shown]
He's not like all my other friends
Who really don't care about me.
Amen."
2811,4,9,Stan Marsh,[to Kenny] Bo-ring.
2812,4,9,Cantor,"And now Mr. Mackey will read his favorite psalm for us, Psalm 46. [steps out of the way]"
2813,4,9,Mr Mackey,"Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay. [Cartman starts talking to Stan and Kenny] Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea..."
2814,4,9,Eric Cartman,"[as Mackey speaks] Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation. [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."" [stops]"
2815,4,9,Mr Mackey,"God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay. [Stan resumes conversing with the other two] Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place- [interrupted by the priest]"
2816,4,9,Stan Marsh,"[as Mackey speaks] Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."""
2817,4,9,Eric Cartman,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] to increase the population of the younger generation."""
2818,4,9,Kenny McCormick,(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
2819,4,9,Eric Cartman,"No no, no. Separation."
2820,4,9,Stan Marsh,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"""
2821,4,9,Priest Maxi,BOYS! You are in CHURCH! [Liane raises her arm and slaps Cartman across the back.]
2822,4,9,Eric Cartman,[falls off the pew and onto the floor] Ugh!
2823,4,9,Mr Mackey,"-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay. [walks from the pulpit back to his seat. The priest replaces him]"
2824,4,9,Priest Maxi,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell. [an organ swells into a dreadful chord. The boys are afraid] Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, searing, flames. Screaming, torture. For eternity. Once you are in hell, you cannot escape. You live forever in horrible pain, in burning agony. All sinners are there in misery, dying over and over and over. [the camera begins to descend through the floor, past the foundation, several layers of dirt, a sewage pipe...] If you be cast down into this black bog of stench, then woe is thou, [...more layers of dirt and some fossils...] for Satan has made it the most miserable place in the universe! [...and finally, an inferno full of skulls] And he will be your ruler! [the camera stops at this sign: ""Welcome to Hell""] Your ruler of pain and agony!"
2825,4,9,Singers,"Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?

Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?

2837,4,9,Satan,"Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'. Oh- Hi, Marsha."
2838,4,9,Walter Matthau,"Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound some brews. You wanna join us?"
2839,4,9,Satan,"Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I can't. Chris and I just moved to the west side and we have to unpack."
2840,4,9,Walter Matthau,"Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!"
2841,4,9,Satan,Bye.
2842,4,9,Satan,Chris?
2843,4,9,Chris,[off-screen] Yeah?
2844,4,9,Satan,"Did you, uh, see my ""Boy With An Umbrella"" Hummel?"
2845,4,9,Chris,"Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers."
2846,4,9,Satan,"Oh, okay, thanks. [the doorbell rings.] Oh, that must be them now. [goes to answer the door, and opens it] Just put the boxes by the-"
2847,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Hello, Satan! [opens his arms wide and grins big. He has two suitcases, one on either side of him]"
2848,4,9,Satan,[stunned] Saddam...
2849,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"[cuddly] Did you miss me, buttercup?"
2850,4,9,Satan,"No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed you!"
2851,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
2852,4,9,Satan,"Oh no. [looks up] Oh, God no."
2853,4,9,Priest Maxi,"A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ! [Stan grits his teeth, Cartman's jaw drops, Kenny trembles a little] Children in this town have not been attending Sunday school after Mass! And adults have not been coming to Confession! If this does not change, I promise you, you will be going to the black pit of Satan's world! [Cartman grits his teeth] That is all. Peace be with you. [congregants rise and file out of church. Randy and Sharon Marsh are the last two adults out]"
2854,4,9,Randy,"Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon."
2855,4,9,Sharon,"Yeah. [Stan, Cartman, and Kenny run up to them from behind]"
2856,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school."
2857,4,9,Sharon,"[she, Liane, and Randy spin around] What?"
2858,4,9,Stan Marsh,"We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! [turns around, runs to the altar, and turns right. Kenny follows him]"
2859,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. [runs out after the other two.]"
2860,4,9,Randy,"Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death."
2861,4,9,Priest Maxi,"[comes up behind them] Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire!"
2862,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk."
2863,4,9,Satan,"I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now."
2864,4,9,Chris,"[peeks out from another room] Is that the movers, Satan?"
2865,4,9,Satan,"[hides his disdain] Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just the movers"
2866,4,9,Chris,"Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter. [disappears]"
2867,4,9,Satan,"Okay, Chris."
2868,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. [flashes his charm]"
2869,4,9,Satan,"[sarcastically] Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before."
2870,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito? [Satan thinks about it. Saddam appears dressed for a fiesta and shakes the maracas around] ¡Me gusta burrito mucho!"
2871,4,9,Satan,"I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now."
2872,4,9,Saddam Hussein,Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
2873,4,9,Satan,"Good-bye, Saddam!"
2874,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us. [pats his hair] You can try, but you know we belong together."
2875,4,9,Satan,"My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats me well. You and I are through. Good-bye. [closes the door, sighs, and walks off to his left, past a window]"
2876,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"[pops up outside the window] Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break! [Satan looks, then lowers the blinds, and continues walking]"
2877,4,9,Nun,"Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion."
2878,4,9,Stan Marsh,[quite afraid] Are we gonna go to hell?
2879,4,9,Sister Anne,"Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion."
2880,4,9,Eric Cartman,"A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?"
2881,4,9,Stan Marsh,What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
2882,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, what if we haven't?"
2883,4,9,Sister Anne,"It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works. [brings out a golden dish with round wafers on it] The priest will give you this round cracker, [lifts up and displays a wafer] and he will say, ""The Body of Christ,"" and then you eat it. [silence]"
2884,4,9,Eric Cartman,Jesus was made of crackers?
2885,4,9,Sister Anne,No.
2886,4,9,Stan Marsh,But crackers are his- body.
2887,4,9,Sister Anne,Yes.
2888,4,9,Kenny McCormick,"[thinks a while, then] (What?!)"
2889,4,9,Sister Anne,"In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, ""eat this, for it is my body."""
2890,4,9,Eric Cartman,So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
2891,4,9,Sister Anne,Nononono!
2892,4,9,Butters Stotch,"Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?"
2893,4,9,Sister Anne,The Body of Christ! [confused faces all around]
2894,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him."
2895,4,9,Sister Anne,No!
2896,4,9,Stan Marsh,No??
2897,4,9,Butters Stotch,Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
2898,4,9,Sister Anne,"Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!"
2899,4,9,Kenny McCormick,O-kay.
2900,4,9,Stan Marsh,O-kay.
2901,4,9,Eric Cartman,O-kay.
2902,4,9,Sister Anne,"And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ."
2903,4,9,Eric Cartman,"[unconvinced, closes his Bible] Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! [rests his head on his left hand]"
2904,4,9,Sister Anne,"Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!"
2905,4,9,Eric Cartman,[startled] Nno!
2906,4,9,Sister Anne,Then stop questioning me.
2907,4,9,Eric Cartman,"But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?"
2908,4,9,Sister Anne,"No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession."
2909,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Confession? [Kenny snaps to attention, jarring music plays in the background]"
2910,4,9,Sister Anne,"You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything. [All the kids look towards Stan Kenny and Cartman, who's faces are stricken with fear]"
2911,4,9,Kenny McCormick,"(OH, SHIT!)"
2912,4,9,Chris,"Those were some great pork chops, Satan."
2913,4,9,Satan,Yeah.
2914,4,9,Chris,"Hey, you. [puts a dish away] You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?"
2915,4,9,Satan,[jittery] Nothing. Why?
2916,4,9,Chris,"Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly."
2917,4,9,Satan,"[sheepish] Oh, huh. Sorry, huh-huh. [holds a plate in his hands, then gives it to Chris]"
2918,4,9,Chris,"[puts it away] Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?"
2919,4,9,Satan,"Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today."
2920,4,9,Chris,[stung] Oh. [thinks] Woww! [sighs] I wasn't ready for that.
2921,4,9,Satan,He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me...
2922,4,9,Chris,I thought you... killed him.
2923,4,9,Satan,"Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?"
2924,4,9,Chris,...Do you still love him?
2925,4,9,Satan,"No, Chris."
2926,4,9,Chris,It's okay of you do.
2927,4,9,Satan,"Well, I mean- [sighs] Of course, there's a part of me that will always love him, I... But I also know how abusive he was—I'm much happier with you."
2928,4,9,Chris,"Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults."
2929,4,9,Satan,What?
2930,4,9,Chris,"We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy."
2931,4,9,Satan,"No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy."
2932,4,9,Chris,"Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself. [tosses a plate into the air. It falls onto the floor and breaks up, startling him] Oops! [bends down to pick up the pieces.] Aw, butternuts! [Satan just glances away]"
2933,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days."
2934,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, okay."
2935,4,9,Stan Marsh,And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
2936,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Right, I already got that one."
2937,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops by] Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?"
2938,4,9,Stan Marsh,We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
2939,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,Uhwuwhat?
2940,4,9,Stan Marsh,Have you confessed all your sins yet?
2941,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,No-o-o-o-o!
2942,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins."
2943,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,Oh good. I don't?
2944,4,9,Eric Cartman,"No, you're already going to hell."
2945,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,I am not!
2946,4,9,Eric Cartman,"You are, too!"
2947,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period."
2948,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm gonna go ask my mom! [walks away]
2949,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?"
2950,4,9,Eric Cartman,Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
2951,4,9,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
2952,4,9,Butters Stotch,[rushes in with Timmy and Token] Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
2953,4,9,Stan Marsh,"What, Butters?"
2954,4,9,Butters Stotch,"Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?"
2955,4,9,Timmy Burch,Timmiih!
2956,4,9,Eric Cartman,What'd we do to Timmy?
2957,4,9,Butters Stotch,"No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!"
2958,4,9,Timmy Burch,Timmiih!
2959,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed."
2960,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something."
2961,4,9,Kenny McCormick,(What are we gonna do?)
2962,4,9,Stan Marsh,I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
2963,4,9,Satan,"[pensive] I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my life is so much better now with Chris. [the monster gives him some commentary in gibberish] Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect in every way, but there's just something about Saddam that I'm more attracted to. [the monster makes a suggestion] In what way? [the monster tells him] Yeah, you're right. Saddam would just treat me bad again. I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys. [turns right to walk away]"
2964,4,9,Chris,[arrives] There you are.
2965,4,9,Satan,"[turns right] Oh hi, Chris!"
2966,4,9,Chris,I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
2967,4,9,Satan,What?
2968,4,9,Chris,"Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight."
2969,4,9,Satan,You WHAT?!
2970,4,9,Chris,I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
2971,4,9,Satan,"Oh, Chris! Rraarr! [raises his arms in fury and points his right hand away. Lightning comes out from his index finger and scorches a tree.] Rraahh! [points his left hand away. Lightning comes out from his index finger and scorches the aboriginal monster he was talking with earlier.]"
2972,4,9,Chris,"[walks up to Satan] Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together."
2973,4,9,Satan,"No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!"
2974,4,9,Chris,"Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore."
2975,4,9,Satan,"[incredulous] Oh, dear God. [slaps his hand to his face]"
2976,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-"
2977,4,9,Eric Cartman,[approaches] How was it?
2978,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!"
2979,4,9,Eric Cartman,Huh?
2980,4,9,Stan Marsh,The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
2981,4,9,Eric Cartman,Who's in there?
2982,4,9,Stan Marsh,I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
2983,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Well, here goes everything. [walks to the penitent side of the confession box and enters.]"
2984,4,9,Eric Cartman,"[hesitantly] Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."
2985,4,9,Priest Maxi,"[in the confessor's side] Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?"
2986,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass..."
2987,4,9,Stan Marsh,"...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-"
2988,4,9,Kenny McCormick,"[arrives] (Hey, dude.)"
2989,4,9,Stan Marsh,God damnit!
2990,4,9,Kenny McCormick,(What??)
2991,4,9,Stan Marsh,"[notices someone and points] Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy. [he and Kenny walk over to her. She's kneeling before a table of candles and a portrait of Jesus] Sister Anne?"
2992,4,9,Sister Anne,"Oh, hello, children."
2993,4,9,Stan Marsh,We have a question.
2994,4,9,Sister Anne,"[rises] Okay, shoot."
2995,4,9,Stan Marsh,Where do handicapped people go when they die?
2996,4,9,Sister Anne,"[thinks a moment, then] The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins."
2997,4,9,Stan Marsh,"But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?"
2998,4,9,Sister Anne,"Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest. [begins to hurry away] I'll see if I can find him. Bye. [Stan and Kenny look at each other]"
2999,4,9,Eric Cartman,"And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?"
3000,4,9,Priest Maxi,Your [clears his throat] con- confession does not leave this box.
3001,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating."
3002,4,9,Priest Maxi,"[guarded] Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew."
3003,4,9,Eric Cartman,"No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. [Cartman looks up for a response, but nothing happens]"
3004,4,9,Priest Maxi,[after a pause] I... see.
3005,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. [the priest grows more concerned and his jaw drops] And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog. [Priest Maxi's worry has turned to anger he's trying to contain] And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of- [an arm tears through the partition and grabs Cartman by the throat] -eh- Ow! [throttles him back and forth] D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow! [the priest pulls him up into the partition a few times] Eh! Oh! Help. [The confession box rocks back and forth] Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!"
3006,4,9,Sister Anne,[arrives and knocks on the priest's door as Cartman screams] Father! I need to talk to you. Father! [an angry Priest Maxi exits the box] I have to ask you a question.
3007,4,9,Priest Maxi,"Okayokay, fine! [walks away with Sister Anne]"
3008,4,9,Eric Cartman,[the door opens and he falls to the floor] Uh-huh- [Stan and Kenny rush up] Oho! Ohoho.
3009,4,9,Stan Marsh,What happened??
3010,4,9,Eric Cartman,"I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God. [Stan and Kenny get afraid] He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously."
3011,4,9,Chris,"Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein."
3012,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"And you must be Mr. Assface. [cocks his head in an open grin] Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy. [reaches into his coat] Here, I brought you a potato. [hands him a baked potato still wrapped in aluminum foil]"
3013,4,9,Chris,"[takes the potato] Oh, thank you."
3014,4,9,Satan,"[sees this and rushes up to Chris] Chris, no! It's a bomb! [takes the potato and chucks it clear of the condo]"
3015,4,9,Chris,"Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?"
3016,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right? [the potato explodes in a manner that reveals it was a bomb after all] Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. [chuckles]"
3017,4,9,Chris,"Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready."
3018,4,9,Ike Broflovski,"behayin' glah, and the he find de eye. [reads from ""Cannery Row"" by John Steinbeck]"
3019,4,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day."
3020,4,9,Ike Broflovski,Cookie monstooh.
3021,4,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[affectionately] Oh, he's growing up so fast! [a door opens and closes]"
3022,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes into the room] Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
3023,4,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Why? What did you do, Kyle?!"
3024,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell."
3025,4,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell."
3026,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,We don't? But what if we're wrong?
3027,4,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too."
3028,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell."
3029,4,9,Ike Broflovski,"Oh, no."
3030,4,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?"
3031,4,9,Ike Broflovski,No-o-o.
3032,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! [goes up to him and takes him away towards the front door. The book falls to the floor]"
3033,4,9,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle!
3034,4,9,Chris,So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
3035,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?"
3036,4,9,Satan,"It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died."
3037,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?"
3038,4,9,Chris,"Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy."
3039,4,9,Saddam Hussein,An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
3040,4,9,Chris,"L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship [Saddam reaches down to stroke Satan's right leg] And I just want you to know [Satan swats Saddam's arm away] that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends."
3041,4,9,Saddam Hussein,Uh huh.
3042,4,9,Chris,"I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with. [Saddam tries twice more with Satan, but Satan keeps swatting Saddam's arm off] And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything. [looks up to Satan] Right? [a tormented Satan looks down at a grinning Saddam, who is still stroking his leg] Right."
3043,4,9,Sister Anne,"Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine."
3044,4,9,Priest Maxi,"Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized?"
3045,4,9,Stan Marsh,I don't think so.
3046,4,9,Priest Maxi,"Then, hell awaits him."
3047,4,9,Sister Anne,"Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to-"
3048,4,9,Priest Maxi,"They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!"
3049,4,9,Sister Anne,"Yes, but-"
3050,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes in with Ike in tow] Mister Father! [Sister Anne looks back at him] We have to ask you something.
3051,4,9,Priest Maxi,"Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?"
3052,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?"
3053,4,9,Priest Maxi,"Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, ""Depart from me, you cursèd, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."" Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire."
3054,4,9,Ike Broflovski,[hiding behind a frightened Kyle] Oh no.
3055,4,9,Sister Anne,Father-
3056,4,9,Priest Maxi,I hope to see all of you in church this Sunday.
3057,4,9,Stan Marsh,We will be. [the boys turn and walk out with Ike. Priest Maxi gloats]
3058,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,We will be. [the boys turn and walk out with Ike. Priest Maxi gloats]
3059,4,9,Eric Cartman,We will be. [the boys turn and walk out with Ike. Priest Maxi gloats]
3060,4,9,Kenny McCormick,We will be. [the boys turn and walk out with Ike. Priest Maxi gloats]
3061,4,9,Sister Anne,"[concerned] Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they will get into heaven."
3062,4,9,Priest Maxi,"Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?!"
3063,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,[breathless] Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
3064,4,9,Stan Marsh,Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. [the boys exit]
3065,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more."
3066,4,9,Eric Cartman,[points the hose at Kyle] Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
3067,4,9,Kyle Broflovski,HAAAAH!
3068,4,9,Eric Cartman,Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
3069,4,9,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
3070,4,9,Eric Cartman,What?
3071,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!"
3072,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, now you've said it, too!"
3073,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, shit! [covers his mouth with his gloves.] Oh!"
3074,4,9,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck! Oops!) [covers his own mouth]
3075,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again."
3076,4,9,Stan Marsh,But what about them?
3077,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Ugh. Oh, I know. [runs away, but returns with an attachment] We can use Wacky Water Weasel! [sets everything up, and the Weasel sets to work spraying Timmy, Kyle, and Ike.]"
3078,4,9,Timmy Burch,Haaaaah!
3079,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Okay, come on. [he, Cartman, and Kenny leave]"
3080,4,9,Timmy Burch,"Haaa-ay, Timmmiih!"
3081,4,9,Chris,"Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired."
3082,4,9,Saddam Hussein,Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. [leaves the table]
3083,4,9,Satan,Good. I'll show you out.
3084,4,9,Chris,"Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!"
3085,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff. [Satan shows him out; he faces Satan] Satan, that guy is a pussy!"
3086,4,9,Satan,"He's stable, Saddam!"
3087,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!"
3088,4,9,Satan,Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
3089,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. [grins]"
3090,4,9,Satan,I'm very happy with my life now.
3091,4,9,Saddam Hussein,Here. [slips a key into Satan's hand] I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
3092,4,9,Satan,"No, Saddam! I won't be needing this!"
3093,4,9,Saddam Hussein,"D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight. [to Chris, still inside the condo] Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!"
3094,4,9,Chris,[off screen] Goodnight [Satan looks torn]
3095,4,9,Voice,"Hello. Your Excellency? [the scene switches to the church in South Park. The voice is Sister Anne's] This is Sister Anne, the Bleeding Eyes of Jesus, calling from the United States?"
3096,4,9,Papal Secretary,"Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope."
3097,4,9,Sister Anne,"Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped."
3098,4,9,Papal Secretary,"Yes, well the pope is here, but please keep it brief. He is a-very old. [the secretary hands the phone over to the pope, who is seated in a throne inside a tiny temple at one end of the cathedral]"
3099,4,9,The Pope,Heh??
3100,4,9,Sister Anne,"Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities."
3101,4,9,The Pope,Heh?
3102,4,9,Sister Anne,Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?
3103,4,9,The Pope,"[soft] Ehhhhh, what's that you say? [loud] Heh?!"
3104,4,9,Sister Anne,[enunciates] Handicap. Mental handicap.
3105,4,9,The Pope,[flaps his lips around with his tongue] Fibibiibibibibiibibih.
3106,4,9,Sister Anne,"[waits, then] ...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true?"
3107,4,9,The Pope,"[snores, then] Eh-bibibiibibibibiibibibih. [Sister Anne says nothing.]"
3108,4,9,Stan Marsh,Come on! This stupid light won't change.
3109,4,9,Token,"[arrives, followed by Butters, Clyde, and Bebe] Come on! Hurry up! [sees the other three boys] Hey, what are you guys doin'?"
3110,4,9,Stan Marsh,We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
3111,4,9,Butters Stotch,Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
3112,4,9,Clyde,"Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. [the crosswalk light turns green]"
3113,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Uh, come on, let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but...]"
3114,4,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Yow!) [a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified]"
3115,4,9,Stan Marsh,"[finally reacts, shrilly] ...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
3116,4,9,Butters Stotch,He had sins that he didn't confess!
3117,4,9,Eric Cartman,And he never took Communion!
3118,4,9,Stan Marsh,He's doomed.
3119,4,9,Clyde,...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
3120,4,9,Eric Cartman,Yeah. [the kids make their way slowly across the street]
3121,4,9,Chris,[grabbing Satan's privates] Yeah. [moves up to Satan's left shoulder] That's hot. [then to the right one] You take it! [Satan turns on the lights as Chris makes his way down to his crotch] You take it now!
3122,4,9,Satan,"Chris, what are you doing?"
3123,4,9,Chris,"I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too."
3124,4,9,Satan,Oh boy.
3125,4,9,Chris,"[resumes his naughtiness] Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch? [Satan begins to grimace] I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that."
3126,4,9,Satan,"Chris, just... don't... don't do that."
3127,4,9,Chris,But it turns you on.
3128,4,9,Satan,"No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah, but uh..."
3129,4,9,Chris,But what?
3130,4,9,Satan,"Nothing. I just- I'm just- really tired is all. Can we- just, please go to sleep? [Chris looks let down] Chris, seriously. I'm just tired, okay?"
3131,4,9,Chris,"[closes his eyes] Okay. I love you, Satan."
3132,4,9,Satan,"I love you too, Saddam."
3133,4,9,Satan,[immediately react] Wuh?!
3134,4,9,Chris,[immediately react] Wuh?!
3135,4,9,Satan,"Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris. [grimaces]"
3136,4,9,Chris,"It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do."
3137,4,9,Satan,I just need to go get some air. okay? I'll be back... really quick. [gets out of bed and leaves]
3138,4,9,Chris,Yeah. Sure. Okay.
3139,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Come on, hurry up! [Stan reaches the door]"
3140,4,9,Stan Marsh,[tries to open it] Oh no! It's locked!
3141,4,9,Eric Cartman,[moves in and tries to open it] What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
3142,4,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. [the kids go around to the back of the church, find the window, and climb in]"
3143,4,9,Stan Marsh,[sees something off to the side] Confession box is over there! [moves towards it]
3144,4,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm first, I'm first! [trips Token and runs past Stan. Token quickly gets up and walks with the others. Cartman opens the penitent door and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition]"
3145,4,9,Woman,"Oh, huhuh."
3146,4,9,Eric Cartman,"[closes the door] What the? [opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins. The kids look back in horror, and his face changes]"
3147,4,9,Priest Maxi,Whoa! [turns and faces the partition while zipping up his pants] Son of a bitch!
3148,4,9,Woman,"[flits out of the penitent side] Eh, heheheheheheh."
3149,4,9,Priest Maxi,"[exits] Uhuh. Kids, uh."
3150,4,9,Stan Marsh,You're a sinner!
3151,4,9,Eric Cartman,You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
3152,4,9,Priest Maxi,"Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh. [drops to his knees and prays] Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!"
3153,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!"
3154,4,9,Priest Maxi,M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell! [begins to weep]
3155,4,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?"
3156,4,9,Eric Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!"
3157,4,9,Damned Soul,"Oh, the pain!  Oh, the pain! [Satan stops and looks at the key Saddam gave him. The handle looks like a coffin]"
3158,4,9,Satan,"[lowers the key] No, I can't. [in front of him is the Bargain Hotel] What am I doing? I know this is the wrong thing to do. I could lose Chris. I can't do this. [turns around and walks away] I can't do this. [stops and turns back]"
3159,4,9,Eric Cartman,"We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh! [Chef and Mr. Garrison arrive] If thy hand offend thee, cut it off! [Stan's parents and the nun are there] It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-"
3160,4,9,Randy,"Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!"
3161,4,9,Sister Anne,[steps up] Oh no.
3162,4,9,Stan Marsh,"[passes out material] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. [from a child's view, the pamphlet is seen. It's called ""Kids Against Hell"" and has a quote from Ezekiel 5:10. It is soon lowered for a good shot at the growing crowd of kids at the street corner]"
3163,4,9,Eric Cartman,There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
3164,4,9,Girl,"I don't wanna to go to hell. [joins the kids, leaving her parents stunned]"
3165,4,9,Eric Cartman,"It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!"
3166,4,10,Announcer,Previously on South Park...
3167,4,10,Priest Maxi,"Today, we are going to talk about hell. [an organ swells into a dreadful chord. The boys are afraid]"
3168,4,10,Saddam,"Hello, Satan! [opens his arms wide and grins big. He has two suitcases, one on either side of him]"
3169,4,10,Satan,[stunned] Saddam...
3170,4,10,Sheila Broflovski,Us Jews don't believe in hell.
3171,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,But what if we're wrong?
3172,4,10,Stan Marsh,"Let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified]"
3173,4,10,Stan Marsh,"[finally reacts, shrilly] ...they've killed Kenny!"
3174,4,10,Butters Stotch,He had sins that he didn't confess!
3175,4,10,Satan,"No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now."
3176,4,10,Priest Maxi,"Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!"
3177,4,10,Chris,"[closes his eyes] I love you, Satan."
3178,4,10,Satan,"I love you too, Saddam."
3179,4,10,Satan Chris,[immediately react] Wuh?!
3180,4,10,Richie,"Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis. [A buoy ring contains a shark, and a larger red buoy warns ""DANGER"" in white letters]"
3181,4,10,Fonzie,"Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie."
3182,4,10,Woman,"Oh, huhuh. [Cartman opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins]"
3183,4,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?"
3184,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!"
3185,4,10,Joanie,Go Fonz!!!
3186,4,10,Fonzie,"Aaaaaa-- [the image freezes in place, so that Fonzie is suspended in mid-air]"
3187,4,10,Announcer,And now the exciting conclusion of... South Park.
3188,4,10,Fonzie,[action resumes]—aaaaaayy-err. [lands inside the buoy ring; the shark catches and eats him live. The shark rises out of the water with Fonzie still in its mouth] No! [the shark drops and rises again] No! [...and again...] No! [a pool of blood develops inside the buoy ring] No!
3189,4,10,Richie,I told him he couldn't do it. [the other three on shore look on stunned]
3190,4,10,Eric Cartman,"I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! [a group of adults gathers just outside the rear school doors. Kyle joins Cartman on the platform...]"
3191,4,10,Principal Victoria,"[""'Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! Oh, praise His name!""] You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman. [""But do you believe in the power of God?""] Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone."
3192,4,10,Liane Cartman,"[gently calls out] Boopie-kins. [""Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?""] It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. [Cartman stops]"
3193,4,10,Stan Marsh,"[joins Cartman on the platform] Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs."
3194,4,10,Kids,Yeah!
3195,4,10,Sharon Marsh,"We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school."
3196,4,10,Stan Marsh,What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
3197,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever."
3198,4,10,Principal Victoria,"Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school."
3199,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was [throws himself down face-first] smacked down by the Lord-uh! [rises] God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! [kids gasp, adults go glum] But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, [Kyle has left and now returns with an easel with a picture of a church on it] so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya [near the top of the left-side wall] to this part hmya. [the grass down below] Who will help us?"
3200,4,10,Kids,[in unison] I will.
3201,4,10,Eric Cartman,Praise God-uh!
3202,4,10,Satan,"If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris. [looks at Saddam's room key] Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again. [looks at it again] M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure. [advances to the hotel, to room 16, then turns around with second thoughts] What am I doing? [takes a step when the room door opens]"
3203,4,10,Saddam,"[in evening suit] What took yo so long, baby?"
3204,4,10,Satan,"[turns around] Saddam, I'm just here to talk."
3205,4,10,Saddam,"Great! Let's talk! [Saddam enters. Saddam rushes to the bed and sits on it, stroking the covers] Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy."
3206,4,10,Satan,"Saddam, I only came here because I need closure."
3207,4,10,Saddam,"Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything."
3208,4,10,Satan,"No! Saddam, listen to me."
3209,4,10,Saddam,Would you like a drink?
3210,4,10,Satan,"Um, maybe just... a little one. [Saddam serves him a drink] I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore. [Satan turns on the TV and a video of a group of men is shown. A sheriff lowers his pants before a kneeling skinhead. Other men are singing, chanting, moaning] I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now. [just now notices the video] What is this?"
3211,4,10,Saddam,These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
3212,4,10,Satan,"Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now."
3213,4,10,Saddam,"[knowingly] Really? So then... What are you doing here? [Satan has no answer. He just looks down and away] Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!"
3214,4,10,Satan,[hurt] Saddam...
3215,4,10,Saddam,"Here, have another drink. [Satan takes it and swallows it down]"
3216,4,10,Satan,"[wakes up] Ooh, whoa... God, my head. Drank too much. [looks to his left] Chris? [the camera zooms out to show Saddam, dressed in leather straps, looking at him lovingly. Five different kinds of dildos and a whip are seen. Satan quickly sits up] Oh no!! [scans the room and sees more sex toys, including an auto club, an Antonio Banderas blow-up doll, a penis pump, and a goat tied to a lamp]"
3217,4,10,Saddam,"[snuggling up] Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil! [tosses the last one off the bed.] Ewuh, I'm all greasy."
3218,4,10,Satan,"[leaves the bed] Oh God, what time is it?"
3219,4,10,Saddam,Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
3220,4,10,Satan,"I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris."
3221,4,10,Saddam,Screw him!!
3222,4,10,Satan,"No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation! [walks towards the door] I just don't know what I'm gonna say. [the door opens and closes. Satan is gone]"
3223,4,10,Saddam,I know how to solve this little problem.
3224,4,10,Tour Bus Driver,"[off-screen] We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula. [the tour bus is seen making its way through Ensenada] We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. [two gas station attendants approach the bus. One of them notices something]"
3225,4,10,Gas Station Attendant,"Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus. [""Listen. There's something stuck under the bus.""]"
3226,4,10,Tour Bus Driver,"'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? [the attendant takes his mop and jabs at the bottom of the bus, and Kenny finally drops down]"
3227,4,10,Kenny McCormick,(Ahow..!)
3228,4,10,Tour Bus Driver,"Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? [Kenny sits up and shakes his dizziness off]"
3229,4,10,Gas Station Attendant,"Pienso que sí. [""I think so."" Kenny stands up]"
3230,4,10,Tour Bus Driver,"Well, here's fifty for the gas. [starts the bus and drives off] Adios."
3231,4,10,Kenny McCormick,(Where am I?)
3232,4,10,Gas Station Attendant,¿Qué?
3233,4,10,Kenny McCormick,(Where am I?)
3234,4,10,Gas Station Attendant,¿Qué?
3235,4,10,Eric Cartman,This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
3236,4,10,Stan Marsh,There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
3237,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!"
3238,4,10,Gerald Broflovski,"[shows up with Sheila, behind the boys] Hello, boys. [they turn around]"
3239,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!"
3240,4,10,Sheila Broflovski,"It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away. [Stan, Cartman and Kyle look at each other, suspicious] Just really quick; she says it's very important."
3241,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. [the boys turn left and walk towards Cartman's house]"
3242,4,10,Sheila Broflovski,I sure hope this works.
3243,4,10,Liane Cartman,"Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise."
3244,4,10,Stan Marsh,"Wow, cool."
3245,4,10,Eric Cartman,"No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!"
3246,4,10,Liane Cartman,What?
3247,4,10,Eric Cartman,"This is a distraction from our work on the church! [grabs a doughnut] Do not think that you can tempt us with toys [takes a bite out of his doughnut] and new games [munches away] and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with! [finishes the doughnut off] Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!"
3248,4,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
3249,4,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh. Well, [sets the dish on the sofa and walks away] alrighty then."
3250,4,10,Liane Cartman,I... don't think it worked.
3251,4,10,All,Aww.
3252,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Let us get back to our work at the church. [the phone rings] Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. [answers it] Hello?"
3253,4,10,Kenny McCormick,"[from a pay phone next to Papas & Beer in Ensenada] (Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)"
3254,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[grins mischievously, then] Oh my God!!"
3255,4,10,Stan Marsh,What?
3256,4,10,Eric Cartman,It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
3257,4,10,Stan Marsh,Kenny?! [move towards the phone] What's he say?
3258,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,[moves next to Stan] Ask him what hell is like.
3259,4,10,Eric Cartman,Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
3260,4,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Um...) [mariachi music is heard, and the street is lively enough]"
3261,4,10,Satan,"Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes. [opens the door and enters. Chris is sitting alone on the sofa reading a book]"
3262,4,10,Chris,"Hey, you."
3263,4,10,Satan,"Hi, Chris. [closes the door]"
3264,4,10,Chris,You... were out all night.
3265,4,10,Satan,"Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina."
3266,4,10,Chris,"Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?"
3267,4,10,Satan,[low voice] Yes. [covers his face in shame]
3268,4,10,Chris,"[approaches] Satan, I understand."
3269,4,10,Satan,[drops his left arm and looks surprised] What?
3270,4,10,Chris,I still feel secure and safe with you.
3271,4,10,Satan,"[walks away exasperated] Oh, n-no!"
3272,4,10,Chris,[puzzled] What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.
3273,4,10,Satan,I know.
3274,4,10,Chris,"Well, what more do you want from me?"
3275,4,10,Satan,"[turns around] Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say ""If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!"" or, or ""I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!"" or something?"
3276,4,10,Chris,"Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything."
3277,4,10,Satan,"Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake."
3278,4,10,Chris,[sits down on the sofa] Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.
3279,4,10,Satan,"[turns away] Ah—I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not you, really, it's, it's me. [Saddam pops up outside the window and checks out the situation, then drops down] You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that. [Saddam slides the window open and drops in behind the sofa, making his way to Chris]"
3280,4,10,Saddam,"[pops up behind Chris with a dagger] Die, pussy! [rams it into Chris's forehead]"
3281,4,10,Chris,Agghhh!
3282,4,10,Satan,"[turns around] Chris! [advances] Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!"
3283,4,10,Saddam,[a dead Chris lies slumped against the sofa's arm] There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
3284,4,10,Satan,"[distraught, buries his face in his hands] No! Not like this..!"
3285,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[on stage wielding a Bible] Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh. [the kids gasp] It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh. [the kids are frightened] He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish."
3286,4,10,Kids,Wagghh..!
3287,4,10,Eric Cartman,"He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!"
3288,4,10,Kids,Whoa!
3289,4,10,Eric Cartman,"And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!"
3290,4,10,Kids,Wagghh! [a couple enters the church]
3291,4,10,Father,Where is our daughter?
3292,4,10,Heidi Turner (Referred to as Marcy),[steps into the aisle] Dad?
3293,4,10,Father,Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
3294,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[quite animated, hops twice] We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! [points]"
3295,4,10,Father,You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
3296,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!"
3297,4,10,Father,[a piece of wood falls from the roof] You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that-- [jab] Aagghh--! [the piece of wood falls off the man's head and rests behind him]
3298,4,10,Mother,"Stephen? [the kids are shocked; she genuflects next to him] Stephen, no!"
3299,4,10,Eric Cartman,"The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!"
3300,4,10,Kids,"Forgive us, Lord."
3301,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Let us pray. [an organ is played] Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry."
3302,4,10,Mother,[in a panic] Stephen? Stephen?
3303,4,10,Stephen,Where... where am I?
3304,4,10,Man,Where are we?
3305,4,10,Man 2,No doubt about it...
3306,4,10,Woman,What's happening??
3307,4,10,Man 3,Oooooooooh!
3308,4,10,Speaker,"Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me? [taps the mic a few times] Hello? Can everyb--? Okay. [the crowd quiets down] Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about--"
3309,4,10,Man 4,"Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!"
3310,4,10,Hell Director,"Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong."
3311,4,10,Soldier,I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.
3312,4,10,Hell Director,"Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well."
3313,4,10,Man 5,"Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?"
3314,4,10,Hell Director,"I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer."
3315,4,10,Crowd,[disappointed] Awww.
3316,4,10,Hell Director,"So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan."
3317,4,10,Satan,[appears in a burst of flame] Oooyeah!
3318,4,10,Crowd,Aaggghh!
3319,4,10,Satan,"Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh... [relents] muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry. [walks away. The crowd's eyes follow him. A woman throws her hands up]"
3320,4,10,Hell Director,"Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims..."
3321,4,10,Chris,"[in the crowd] Satan! [Satan turns and sees him, then smiles. Chris makes his way through the crowd] 'Scuse me. Excuse me."
3322,4,10,Satan,Chris! [he and Chris now stand before each other] But I thought you were dead!
3323,4,10,Chris,"Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
3324,4,10,Satan,"Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--"
3325,4,10,Chris,"Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?"
3326,4,10,Satan,Uh... yeah. Gr-great.
3327,4,10,Crowd,Awww.
3328,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. [Sister Anne approaches]"
3329,4,10,Liane Cartman,"[enters] Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you."
3330,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. [Liane leaves]"
3331,4,10,Sister Anne,"[sits] Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives."
3332,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Sister, have you read this book?"
3333,4,10,Sister Anne,"Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have."
3334,4,10,Eric Cartman,Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
3335,4,10,Sister Anne,"Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives."
3336,4,10,Eric Cartman,Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
3337,4,10,Sister Anne,No.
3338,4,10,Eric Cartman,"We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! [resumes his work]"
3339,4,10,Sister Anne,"[exasperated, drops her head in her hands] Uugh..! [lifts her head] Wait a minute. That's it. [rises and walks away]"
3340,4,10,Televangelist,[suddenly on TV] ...And I'm gonna save all of you right now. [raps a woman on the head. She goes unconscious] I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.
3341,4,10,Eric Cartman,Well...
3342,4,10,Saddam,"Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!"
3343,4,10,Chris,Yeah. It's me.
3344,4,10,Saddam,I thought I killed you!
3345,4,10,Chris,Yeah...
3346,4,10,Saddam Chris,"Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?"
3347,4,10,Saddam,"Right, right."
3348,4,10,Chris,Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
3349,4,10,Saddam,A walk?
3350,4,10,Chris,Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
3351,4,10,Saddam,[considers it] Is this some kind of trick?
3352,4,10,Chris,"No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?"
3353,4,10,Saddam,"Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick. [goes inside humming and reaches his dresser. He sees the dagger and takes it with him behind his back, then rejoins Chris] Okay, let's walk. [Chris walks while Saddam closes the door]"
3354,4,10,Chris,"Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much."
3355,4,10,Saddam,"Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?"
3356,4,10,Chris,"Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them."
3357,4,10,Saddam,"You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! [takes his dagger out and slices into Chris's right shoulder]"
3358,4,10,Chris,"Agghhh! [Saddam goes into a grave, takes out a shovel, and slices off Chris's lower right leg. Chris falls down] Oh God!"
3359,4,10,Saddam,Ah hahaha!
3360,4,10,Chris,"Nooo! Agh! [reaches into his right shoulder, takes the dagger, and thrusts it into Saddam's left eye]"
3361,4,10,Saddam,Aggghhh! [swings the shovel at Chris and strikes him down with it]
3362,4,10,Chris,"Ow! [Saddam jumps on him and pulls his heart out of his body] Goo-aagh..! [Saddam holds the heart high in the air, then collapses on top of Chris's body. The camera zooms out]"
3363,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?"
3364,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yes!
3365,4,10,Eric Cartman,Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
3366,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yes!
3367,4,10,Eric Cartman,"That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! [smacks him on the face] Theah!"
3368,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,[angrily] Ow! [rubs his right temple and cheek while Cartman talks]
3369,4,10,Eric Cartman,Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
3370,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[softens] Uh, I think so."
3371,4,10,Eric Cartman,Praise the Lord-uh!
3372,4,10,Crowd,[ad lib all at once] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God! [two robed assistants help a happy Kyle off the stage]
3373,4,10,Eric Cartman,"For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person! [Timmy rolls up in his wheelchair] This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!"
3374,4,10,Butters Stotch,Huh-Hallelujah!
3375,4,10,Timmy Burch,Timmiiiy!
3376,4,10,Eric Cartman,We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
3377,4,10,Timmy Burch,Timmiiiy!
3378,4,10,Eric Cartman,Devil be [smacks him on the face] gone-uh!
3379,4,10,Timmy Burch,Haagggh.
3380,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Now walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]"
3381,4,10,Timmy Burch,Haagggh.
3382,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[turns away, then back] Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!"
3383,4,10,Timmy Burch,Haghh.
3384,4,10,Eric Cartman,"The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]"
3385,4,10,Timmy Burch,Timmilih? [drops to the floor on his feet and stands unsteadily. Cartman smiles openly]
3386,4,10,Eric Cartman,He walks-uh!
3387,4,10,Kids,Whoa!
3388,4,10,Timmy Burch,Oh-aagghhh! [falls forward and crashes through the floor head first. A beaming Cartman mistakes this for something good]
3389,4,10,Eric Cartman,Yes! Praise the Lord!
3390,4,10,Kids,Praise the Lord!
3391,4,10,Satan,"And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all."
3392,4,10,JonBen t Ramsey,"Wow, that really sucks."
3393,4,10,Satan,"I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer."
3394,4,10,JonBen t Ramsey,"Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice."
3395,4,10,Satan,Who?
3396,4,10,JonBen t Ramsey,God.
3397,4,10,Satan,"[stunned] God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years."
3398,4,10,JonBen t Ramsey,"Well then, maybe it's time."
3399,4,10,Kids,Do dodo dum do dodoDo dodo dum do dodo
3400,4,10,Eric Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordWhere are you from, little boy? [this boy wears glasses]"
3401,4,10,Boy wearing glasses,Denver.
3402,4,10,Eric Cartman,And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
3403,4,10,Boy wearing glasses,"Yeah, that's right."
3404,4,10,Kids,Wooooo!
3405,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! [smacks the boy in the face and knocks him out]"
3406,4,10,Boy wearing glasses,Aghh... [two robed assistants carry him off]
3407,4,10,Kids,Hooray!
3408,4,10,Eric Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!"
3409,4,10,Ugly Girl,Yes!
3410,4,10,Eric Cartman,He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at! [smacks her on the face] Bah!
3411,4,10,Ugly Girl,Wagh...
3412,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[moonwalks] Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say ""Amen!"""
3413,4,10,Kids,"Amen! [the pianist is shown, with a girl singing next to him]"
3414,4,10,All,"Lord, Lord, Lord"
3415,4,10,Mormon 1,"Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!"
3416,4,10,Satan,"Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by."
3417,4,10,Mormon 2,"Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades."
3418,4,10,Mormons In Heaven,[ad lib all at once] Alright. Yeah.
3419,4,10,Mormon 1,"And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie."
3420,4,10,Mormons In Heaven,Ooooh!
3421,4,10,Mormon 3,Yeahahah!
3422,4,10,Satan,"Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?"
3423,4,10,Mormon 2,Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.
3424,4,10,Mormon 1,I'm so grateful for that.
3425,4,10,Mormons In Heaven,"[in assent] Me, too. Uh huh."
3426,4,10,Satan,Great. Thanks. [walks off]
3427,4,10,Satan,[clears his throat] Ah... Hello? G-God? It's uh... Satan. [quickly shields his eyes as a sphere of light descends towards him]
3428,4,10,God,"[in silhouette] Yea. Look upon me, and know me."
3429,4,10,Satan,"Hi, God."
3430,4,10,God,"Hello, Satan. [has a body made from bits of some of the creatures he created] It's... been a long time."
3431,4,10,Satan,Yeah.
3432,4,10,God,What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
3433,4,10,Satan,"No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice."
3434,4,10,God,You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
3435,4,10,Satan,"No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, [God scratches behind his left ear] was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April..."
3436,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! [The clapping stops as confused faces appear in the congregation, and the music quiets a bit. Stan and Kyle look at each other as Cartman goes for the collection box] So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah, [sets the box at center stage] and putting a dollar in the box-ah! [kids begin to approach the stage] Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! [rolls on his back as the donations come in]"
3437,4,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that seems kind of... weird."
3438,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
3439,4,10,Satan,...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.
3440,4,10,God,"[considers the story, then] Jesus, what the hell happened to you?"
3441,4,10,Satan,Huh?
3442,4,10,God,You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
3443,4,10,Satan,"Well, I just don't know which one to pick."
3444,4,10,God,"No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them. [Satan listens] And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist."
3445,4,10,Satan,"God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself."
3446,4,10,God,Bingo. [a fly gets near him and he snaps his tongue out to catch it and eat it]
3447,4,10,Satan,"Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes."
3448,4,10,God,"It was nice to see you again, Satan."
3449,4,10,Satan,You too.
3450,4,10,God,"Goodbye. [turns into the sphere of light and flies up and away. Satan turns and walks off, but encounters the Mormons]"
3451,4,10,Mormon 2,Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?
3452,4,10,Mormon 1,"Yes, would you?"
3453,4,10,Satan,"Uh, no, I need to be getting back."
3454,4,10,Mormon 2,"Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play."
3455,4,10,Mormon 4,Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.
3456,4,10,Satan,"Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really  gotta go. [disappears in a burst of flames]"
3457,4,10,Mormon 1,"Well, he seemed like a nice fellow."
3458,4,10,Mormon 4,Yes. [a few seconds of silence follow]
3459,4,10,Mormon 2,Let's go make things out of egg cartons.
3460,4,10,Mormons In Heaven,"[ad lib] Oooh, yeah. I'll do that."
3461,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[offscreen] Yeess. [the camera looks at him, now rolling around shirtless in $1 bills, now grabbing a bunch and bathing in them] Yeess. [sees Stan and Kyle] It worked, you guys, it actually worked!"
3462,4,10,Stan Marsh,What worked?
3463,4,10,Eric Cartman,Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
3464,4,10,Stan Kyle,What?
3465,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,You're keeping that money yourself?
3466,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars! [grins big] Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route."
3467,4,10,Stan Marsh,Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
3468,4,10,Eric Cartman,"It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school."
3469,4,10,Stan Marsh,"[he and Kyle are now angry] Well, what about going to hell and all that?!"
3470,4,10,Eric Cartman,"Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that."
3471,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,[points] Then why didn't you tell us?!
3472,4,10,Eric Cartman,"My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!"
3473,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
3474,4,10,Eric Cartman,[rolls around in the money] Suck my balls!
3475,4,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I an so disillusioned right now."
3476,4,10,Saddam,"Die, pussy! [smashes the brick on Chris's head, and they both fall]"
3477,4,10,Chris,"Ow..! [gets up, grabs one of Saddam's legs, and pulls it off]"
3478,4,10,Saddam,"Aagghh! [gets up, grabs his leg back and beats Chris over the back with it. Chris falls on his face]"
3479,4,10,Chris,"Aagghh! [grabs one end of the leg, and now it's a tug of war. Satan arrives and sees the battle]"
3480,4,10,Satan,"Guys, guys, guys! [the two rivals stop and face him] Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision."
3481,4,10,Chris,You have?
3482,4,10,Satan,Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.
3483,4,10,Chris Saddam,What?!
3484,4,10,Satan,"Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want. [Chris looks dejected] So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself. [Saddam sighs]"
3485,4,10,Chris,Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
3486,4,10,Satan,"No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!"
3487,4,10,Chris,Fine. [walks away]
3488,4,10,Saddam,"Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! [Satan is shocked]"
3489,4,10,Eric Cartman,Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! [Sister Anne enters the church]
3490,4,10,Sister Anne,"[walking down center aisle] Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop!"
3491,4,10,Eric Cartman,Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
3492,4,10,Sister Anne,I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else. [steps aside. The curtains part. Jesus enters and walks down the aisle]
3493,4,10,Kids,[in obvious awe] Wow!
3494,4,10,Butters Stotch,Jesus!
3495,4,10,Eric Cartman,[worried] Uh-oh.
3496,4,10,Jesus,"Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school."
3497,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[tugs on Jesus' robs, then softly] Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay."
3498,4,10,Jesus,"God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him."
3499,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[goes for the collection box again] Ee-yes, by doing that, [brings it out] and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!"
3500,4,10,Bebe Stevens,Let's go ice-skating.
3501,4,10,Girls,Yea! [leave their seats]
3502,4,10,Butters Stotch,"Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too."
3503,4,10,Boy wearing glasses,Yeah. [others leave their seats and vacate the church]
3504,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[on his knees] No, come back! You face everlasting damnation! [the last congregant leaves the church] Wait! No! No! [pounds the floor with his fists a few times] I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!"
3505,4,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Serves you right, Cartman!"
3506,4,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
3507,4,10,Jesus,"But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!"
3508,4,10,Eric Cartman,You're gonna send me to hell?
3509,4,10,Jesus,No. Worse!
3510,4,10,Kenny McCormick,[rushes up to him] (Eric! Eric!)
3511,4,10,Eric Cartman,"[sees Kenny] Aw, crap!"
3512,4,10,Satan,"[encounters two men] Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick."
3513,4,10,Rick,"Hi, Satan."
3514,4,10,Saddam,[waiting in the road] There you are!
3515,4,10,Satan,[rolls his eyes] Awgh... Not again.
3516,4,10,Saddam,You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
3517,4,10,Satan,"Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!"
3518,4,10,Saddam,"You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me."
3519,4,10,Satan,"Yes, I can! Raaarrr! [blasts a hole through Saddam with lightning from his index finger. Saddam falls]"
3520,4,10,Saddam,"Aw, you little..prick!"
3521,4,10,Satan,"Goodbye forever, Saddam!"
3522,4,10,Saddam,"[coughs] What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow."
3523,4,10,Satan,Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.
3524,4,10,Saddam,Let me in where? [flames engulf Saddam and disappears]
3525,4,10,Saddam,"What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!"
3526,4,10,Mormon 5,"Hello, and welcome."
3527,4,10,Mormon 1,"We're glad you made it, brother."
3528,4,10,Saddam,"Ey, who the hell are you?"
3529,4,10,Mormon 6,"We're just about to do a play, about how much stealing hurts you deep inside. Come join us. [he and others crowd in on Saddam]"
3530,4,10,Mormons In Heaven,[ad lib] Yes. Come on. Let's go.
3531,4,10,Mormon 6,You're here forever. [the Mormons lift him up and carry him away over their heads]
3532,4,10,Saddam,Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!
3533,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade."
3534,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! [two older boys come up behind Stan and Kyle and punch them to the floor. A third 5th-grader arrives. Stan and Kyle look up.]
3535,4,11,5th Grader in middle,"Get out of my way, you little dorks! [Stan and Kyle struggle a bit, then get up]"
3536,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!"
3537,4,11,5th Grader in middle,"Yeah, but now, we're fifth-graders, you stupid fourth-graders, so move it! [he and the boy to his left punch Stan and Kyle down again.]"
3538,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[rises with Stan] Ungh, gay, dude."
3539,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up. [looks left and sees someone] Hey, come here [signals a boy over.]"
3540,4,11,Younger Boy,What?
3541,4,11,Stan Marsh,What grade are you going into?
3542,4,11,Younger Boy,Thi-ird
3543,4,11,Stan Marsh,Stupid third grader!
3544,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, [punches the boy down] get out of here! [withdraws]"
3545,4,11,Younger Boy,Uhuhuhow.
3546,4,11,Eric Cartman,"There, that's better."
3547,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver."
3548,4,11,Stan Marsh,Denver? [Butters and Clyde arrive]
3549,4,11,Eric Cartman,"U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. [Kevin arrives]"
3550,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! [Pip arrives, then Craig, then Wendy and Bebe]"
3551,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Alright. [turns to face the gathering group] Hey, listen up everybody! [Tweek and four others arrive, then Timmy...] We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! [the other kids smile]"
3552,4,11,Clyde Donovan,Like what?
3553,4,11,Stan Marsh,"[with a look of determination] Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!"
3554,4,11,The Kids,YEAH!!!
3555,4,11,Eric Cartman,"[softly] Why, that's PERfect!"
3556,4,11,Butters Stotch,"Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down, [turns to his left to demonstrate] should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?"
3557,4,11,Stan Marsh,"...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters."
3558,4,11,Butters Stotch,"Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this [shows his back to Stan and moves his right hand around], with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl."
3559,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
3560,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"""
3561,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Together we are strong! [raises fists]
3562,4,11,The Kids,YEAH!!!
3563,4,11,Clyde Donovan,"[points to Timmy] Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down."
3564,4,11,Stan Marsh,"We got you covered, Timmy."
3565,4,11,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
3566,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?"
3567,4,11,Butters Stotch,"Huhuh, look at all this stuff."
3568,4,11,Eric Cartman,"[takes a seat] Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?"
3569,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, look at the walls. [A new alphabet strip in Vivaldi font hangs over the chalkboard] Everything is written in some strange, foreign language."
3570,4,11,New Teacher,"[enters, faces the students, and talks with a bit of an accent] Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade. [the kids stare at her with mouths open. Her breasts hang down to her knees]"
3571,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Holy God, dude!"
3572,4,11,Kenny McCormick,(Those titties are fuckin' huge!) [the teacher turns and write on the board...]
3573,4,11,New Teacher,My name is Ms. Choksondik.
3574,4,11,Stan Marsh,"[softly, to Kyle] ...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. [starts chuckling]"
3575,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! [starts chuckling]
3576,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"[now with book in hand] Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?! [a stunned silence fills the room] I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade! [Cartman grabs on tight to his chair as he looks at the wall clock, which now reads 8:35] And it is time to go to work!"
3577,4,11,Eric Cartman,"[chuckles, leaps up on his desk, and moons Ms. Choksondik] KISS MY ASS!!! [no one else moves a muscle, as they are still awed by the teacher's appearance. Cartman looks left, then right...] Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak."
3578,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"[arms akimbo] Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this."
3579,4,11,Eric Cartman,"[with his back still to Ms. Choksondik] Oh, I'm sure I do."
3580,4,11,Ms Choksondik,This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! [wags a finger at him]
3581,4,11,Eric Cartman,I'm trying.
3582,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class."
3583,4,11,Eric Cartman,"[pulls his pants up and sits down again] Fantastic, then."
3584,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"[turns to the board and begins writing] Now, let us begin our first-day exam. [the class sighs audibly] SILENCE!"
3585,4,11,Stan Marsh,What a bitch!
3586,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
3587,4,11,Eric Cartman,You guys are all such pussies!
3588,4,11,Tweek Tweak,"I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!"
3589,4,11,Stan Marsh,This is it. The end of innocence. [grows sad] This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
3590,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,I just didn't think it would come so soon.
3591,4,11,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
3592,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
3593,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
[wistfully] Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
[a classroom scene, then a playground scene as heads of Cartman and Kenny float by]
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
[Mr. Garrison is dressed as a pirate before a happy class]
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
[Their desks turn into marshmallow seats and float up as the classroom fades into sky. A teddy-bear face floats by]
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
[They float towards a rainbow and sun, and the scene fades to black, then to the playground]
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
[Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land]
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
[Cartman makes a glitter picture of a cow's face]
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
[Kenny makes one of a clown holding a bloody knife in one hand and a boy's bloody head in the other]
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
[Cartman sings to the audience and points]
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
[Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land, then gives each kid a happy spanking in a room full of huge wrapped presents. The scene fades to the playground again]
To Third Grade
[A moment of silence, and Clyde starts to cry. Butters draws near and consoles him]"
3594,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
3595,4,11,Butters Stotch,Huh-it sure was.
3596,4,11,Eric Cartman,[wistfully] I wish I was still there.
3597,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!"
3598,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,How?
3599,4,11,Stan Marsh,[a bit dramatic] We travel back in time.
3600,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh yeah, time travel."
3601,4,11,Butters Stotch,Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt? [waves the suggestion off] I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
3602,4,11,Stan Marsh,It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
3603,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it."
3604,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement."
3605,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!"
3606,4,11,Nerd 1,"When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-"
3607,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade."
3608,4,11,Nerd 2,"Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back."
3609,4,11,Stan Marsh,"We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there."
3610,4,11,Nerd 1,Oh.
3611,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,So can you do it?
3612,4,11,Nerd 2,"It's all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time is possible. We just need to find an inertia device. [they think]"
3613,4,11,Nerd 1,Heeeyyy. [approaches Timmy's chair] This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need.
3614,4,11,Timmy Burch,Tuh-timmih?
3615,4,11,Principal Victoria,"Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!"
3616,4,11,Chef,What's the problem?
3617,4,11,Mr Mackey,"Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra."
3618,4,11,Chef,You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
3619,4,11,Mr Mackey,"No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay. [the door opens and a very angry Ms. Choksondik enters]"
3620,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Principal Victoria, I would like a word! [her elongated breasts swing freely under her blouse.]"
3621,4,11,Chef,Oooo! Call the doctor!
3622,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!"
3623,4,11,Principal Victoria,"Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade."
3624,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!"
3625,4,11,Principal Victoria,Oh? Which one?
3626,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?! [Terror strikes the faces of Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria as they look at each other]"
3627,4,11,Principal Victoria,I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
3628,4,11,Ms Choksondik,Why?! Where did he go?!
3629,4,11,Mr Mackey,"[softly, slowly] We... don't like to talk about it."
3630,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with [raises her left arm, which causes the breast nipples to reveal themselves] God as my witness-"
3631,4,11,The Adults,Aww Oooo!
3632,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top! [the others recoil at the sight of her nipples again] I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!"
3633,4,11,Principal Victoria,"[trying to hide her stare] Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then. [Ms. Choksondik exits and the other three breathe sighs of relief. Chef instinctively vomits, then covers his mouth.]"
3634,4,11,Nerd 1,"Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way [towards the board], then make the required magnetic vibrations."
3635,4,11,Nerd 2,"If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom."
3636,4,11,Wendy Testaburger,"You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?"
3637,4,11,Nerd 1,"Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it."
3638,4,11,Nerd 2,"And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago."
3639,4,11,Stan Marsh,Back in the third grade.
3640,4,11,Kids,Cool/Wow.
3641,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!"
3642,4,11,Kids,Yeah!
3643,4,11,Stan Marsh,Oh! Here she comes.
3644,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"[enters] Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh."
3645,4,11,Eric Cartman,"[hops up on his seat] Suck my balls!!! [no one else moves] Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-"
3646,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"[sternly] I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!"
3647,4,11,Eric Cartman,"We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!"
3648,4,11,Ms Choksondik,It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
3649,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? [a handheld controller with two thumb joysticks is activated. The two nerds get to work]"
3650,4,11,Nerd 1,Primary fusion initiated.
3651,4,11,Nerd 2,Molecular grenadine active. [Timmy's chair starts to convulse]
3652,4,11,Timmy Burch,Aa-aa-ah!
3653,4,11,Ms Choksondik,What are you doing?!
3654,4,11,Eric Cartman,"We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! [the wheelchair is launched and Timmy moves towards the chalkboard]"
3655,4,11,Timmy Burch,Timmaaaaaaaaah! [Ms. Choksondik steps aside as Timmy breaks through the wall and out into the snow] Timmaaaaaaaaah! [his voice trails off. The class is in shock. Ms. Choksondik turns and looks out the gaping hole as Timmy turns right and goes past a tree]
3656,4,11,Nerd 1,I didn't think it would work.
3657,4,11,Nerd 2,Me neither.
3658,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!"
3659,4,11,Eric Cartman,You're damn right they do!
3660,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
3661,4,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
3662,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Come on! [the other kids scramble out of their chairs and rush outside]
3663,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Children! Children, come back here!"
3664,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Timmy, you have to stop!"
3665,4,11,Nerd 1,No!
3666,4,11,Stan Marsh,No??
3667,4,11,Nerd 1,"Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high."
3668,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
3669,4,11,Nerd 1,No!
3670,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,[with trembling voice] No??
3671,4,11,Nerd 2,"We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows!"
3672,4,11,Stan Marsh,"So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?"
3673,4,11,The Nerds,Yup.
3674,4,11,Stan Marsh,My God!
3675,4,11,Anchor Tom and a field reporter,[Timmy is shown moving down the street screaming] It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives.
3676,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Over here, over here!"
3677,4,11,Anchor Tom and a field reporter,"The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device."
3678,4,11,Timmy Burch,"[in distress] Timmi-hih-ih! [above him a helicopter appears, and a SWAT team member is lowered while keeping up with Timmy]"
3679,4,11,SWAT Hansen,"Closer! [reaches Timmy] Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still! [both approach a pair of women waiting to hitch a ride going the other direction]"
3680,4,11,Pilot,"Look out, Hansen!"
3681,4,11,SWAT rescuer Hansen,"Oh! [flies into the blonde, knocking her away. Timmy ends up with the brunette on his chair]"
3682,4,11,Brunette,Aaaah!
3683,4,11,Timmy Burch,Timmaaay!
3684,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,"[floats up to them again] Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!"
3685,4,11,Brunette,"Oh my God, what's going on?"
3686,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,"Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!"
3687,4,11,Brunette,What?! [scrambles around Timmy] AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!
3688,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!
3689,4,11,Brunette,[trying to hang on] O-kay. O-kay. Omigod.
3690,4,11,Timmy Burch,Tih-Timmah? [the woman sets the speed and locks it in a flash]
3691,4,11,Brunette,Okay. I kept the speed at 5.
3692,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?
3693,4,11,Brunette,Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!
3694,4,11,Stan Marsh,Less than 20 minutes?!
3695,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! What have we done?!
3696,4,11,Principal Victoria,Whattaya think? Too forward? [the door opens and in enters...]
3697,4,11,Ms Choksondik,I HAVE HAD IT!!!
3698,4,11,Principal Victoria,Waaah! [tosses the bra behind her seat]
3699,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison! [again, the three other adults show fear...]"
3700,4,11,Principal Victoria,"As we said before, that's impossible."
3701,4,11,Ms Choksondik,What in God's name happened to him?
3702,4,11,Chef,"Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts."
3703,4,11,Principal Victoria,And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
3704,4,11,Mr Mackey,"After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn."
3705,4,11,Principal Victoria,He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
3706,4,11,Chef,"Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', ""I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"""
3707,4,11,Mr Garrison,[barely audible in the distance. The adults strain to hear] Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!
3708,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"And, nobody has found him?"
3709,4,11,Mr Mackey,"Well, we really haven't ll-looked."
3710,4,11,Ms Choksondik,I see. [a kitten walks up to her] Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!
3711,4,11,Principal Victoria,But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
3712,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up [arms spread out and raised to chest level] and up [raised to ear level] and up!"
3713,4,11,Chef,NOOO!!
3714,4,11,Principal Victoria,NOOO!!
3715,4,11,Mr. Mackey,NOOO!!
3716,4,11,Ms Choksondik,[lowers upraised arms] What?
3717,4,11,Brunette,"Oh my God, Oh my God!"
3718,4,11,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death. [camera pulls back to show the nerds next to the reporter, and the boys across the street] Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here."
3719,4,11,Nerd 1,"Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-"
3720,4,11,Timmy Burch,"[while the blond nerd talks] Ah, please help!"
3721,4,11,Nerd 2,Which just turned into a time bomb.
3722,4,11,Timmy Burch,Please help.
3723,4,11,Nerd 1,This has never happened in all the 72 original Star Trek episodes.
3724,4,11,Nerd 2,"Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes."
3725,4,11,Nerd 1,"...No, there were 72."
3726,4,11,Nerd 2,No there weren't!
3727,4,11,Nerd 1,"[pushes his friend away] Oh, you are such a nerd! [they start slapping each other around]"
3728,4,11,Field Reporter,"[camera zooms in] Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device."
3729,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,"It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine."
3730,4,11,Brunette,Oh my God!
3731,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,"[sets Kenny on a dolly and secures him] Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready?"
3732,4,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Yes, sir!)"
3733,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,"Go below! [releases the winch. Kenny and the dolly make their way to Timmy, but they pass each other. Kenny keeps rolling down the road past Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]"
3734,4,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Hi guys.) [keeps rolling until he trips over a manhole cover.] (Uh oh.) [the dolly lands on him] (Uff. I'm okay.) [the winch is suddenly yanked, and Kenny zips away] (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) [the camera switches to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman looking in the direction of a terribly screechy sound. Soon, Kenny appears ripping up the road with his face, and he stops in front of them, dead]"
3735,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Well, who didn't see that coming?"
3736,4,11,Brunette,[camera back on the wheelchair] Oh my God! Oh my God!
3737,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,Stay calm! You have to stay calm! [Timmy looks up at him]
3738,4,11,Brunette,[in a panic] But if we got off the chair it blows up!
3739,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,"No no, that's only if the boy gets off."
3740,4,11,Brunette,Oh. [hops off and stands up] See ya!
3741,4,11,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [Hansen starts to work on the chair]
3742,4,11,Pilot,"Ten seconds, Hansen!"
3743,4,11,Stan Marsh,"...nine, eight..."
3744,4,11,Timmy Burch,[looks down at Hansen] Please-a help me.
3745,4,11,Pilot,"...six, five..."
3746,4,11,Timmy Burch,Please help me. Please help me.
3747,4,11,Rescuer Hansen and his pilot,"Got it! I think! Up, up! [the helicopter rises and takes him up with it]"
3748,4,11,Timmy Burch,"[upset] Timmay! [with a burst of speed the wheelchair accelerates, then disappears in a flare. Nothing remains of him. The rescuer is back in the helicopter looking down at the event with other rescuers, and the boys are on the curb shocked. The nerds are stunned, and the TV shows the site of the disappearance without comment]"
3749,4,11,Nerd 1,"Hey, it did work. [the other nerd grins]"
3750,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Hello-oo-ooo. [walks further in with a lit flashlight] Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed. [calls out] Is anyone here? [the beam falls on Mr. Garrison, now hunched over against a wall and with a full beard. Mr. Hat has a matching beard. Garrison hisses at her] Mister? Mr. Garrison?"
3751,4,11,Mr Garrison,Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
3752,4,11,Ms Choksondik,I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help. [Garrison hisses at her again] Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.
3753,4,11,Mr Garrison,"[hiding from the light] No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months. [the cats try to get at Ms. Choksondik's]"
3754,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!"
3755,4,11,Mr Garrison,"Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?"
3756,4,11,Ms Choksondik,Choksondik.
3757,4,11,Mr Garrison,No I don't! [rushes up to her] IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!
3758,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!"
3759,4,11,Mr Garrison,...Two hundred bucks.
3760,4,11,Ms Choksondik,...Done.
3761,4,11,Stan Marsh,Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
3762,4,11,Nerd 1,Huh? Oh... Can't.
3763,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!"
3764,4,11,Nerd 1,"I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!"
3765,4,11,Stan Marsh,W-what did you get in a fight about?
3766,4,11,Nerd 1,There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!
3767,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!"
3768,4,11,Nerd 1,No! He actually thinks there's 72.!
3769,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?"
3770,4,11,Nerd 1,"No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong..."
3771,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Alright, come on, guys. [the boys exit the basement and head up the stairs] Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!"
3772,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
3773,4,11,Timmy Burch,Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!
3774,4,11,Mr Garrison,"Alright, let's try it again."
3775,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"""Children, we are now going to do math problems."""
3776,4,11,Mr Garrison,"""But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."""
3777,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"""Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"""
3778,4,11,Mr Garrison,"""Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"""
3779,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"""Don't use that kind of language, young man!"""
3780,4,11,Mr Garrison,NOOO![Ms. Choksondik drops the books in terror]
3781,4,11,Ms Choksondik,[drops the books in terror] No??
3782,4,11,Mr Garrison,"Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them."""
3783,4,11,Ms Choksondik,Oh.
3784,4,11,Mr Garrison,"Now, let's try it again. [gathers the books up and repositions them on Ms. Choksondik's hands and head, then stands to her left. She resumes balancing on her left foot and concentrates.] SUCK MY BALLS!"
3785,4,11,Ms Choksondik,Pre-sent them?
3786,4,11,Mr Garrison,"[softens] Good. [Ms. Choksondik relaxes a bit and opens her eyes] Very good. [with authority] You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons."
3787,4,11,Ms Choksondik,I'm ready. I'm not afraid.
3788,4,11,Mr Garrison,"[ominously, gruffly] You will be! You will be! [coughs] You will be."
3789,4,11,Stan Marsh,"God-damnit, this is ridiculous."
3790,4,11,Nerd 2,[opens the door angrily] What?!
3791,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?"
3792,4,11,Nerd 2,"Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! ""The Menagerie"" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!"
3793,4,11,Eric Cartman,Who the hell cares?!
3794,4,11,Nerd 2,I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!
3795,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
3796,4,11,Nerd 2,"No, because he's WRONG!"
3797,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!"
3798,4,11,Nerd 2,And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world. [slams the door shut]
3799,4,11,Eric Cartman,"God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!"
3800,4,11,Stan Marsh,I know.
3801,4,11,Butters Stotch,"Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that ""The Menagerie"" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha. [pauses to see if anyone responds] Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses."
3802,4,11,Stan Marsh,Wait a minute! I've got it. [knocks again]
3803,4,11,Nerd 2,[opens the door angrily] What?!
3804,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!"
3805,4,11,Nerd 2,"[thinks for a moment] Dude, Jesus, you're right."
3806,4,11,Mr Garrison,This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
3807,4,11,Ms Choksondik,What lives inside?
3808,4,11,Mr Garrison,Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
3809,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Oh, alrighty. [enters the base of the tree and through the hewn hallway, then sees a light at the other end.] What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side! [peers through it, then pulls back] There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here. [thinks for a moment] Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids! [clenches her fists] I think I get it now! [walks out the other end]"
3810,4,11,Mr Garrison,"[bides his time and sighs] Hey, hurry up in there! [under his breath] Jesus. [knocks on the tree entrance] You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight! [looks at the entrance, then looks in] You in there?! [enters the hallway himself] Hey, where the hell did she go? [a few more steps, and rumbling begins] What the? [the entrance closes and a mirror Garrison, clean-shaven, appears. The unkempt Garrison shivers] Haaa! Who? Who are you?"
3811,4,11,Clean Garrison,[surely] I am you. [approaches the unkempt Garrison] I am your gay side.
3812,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,"My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!"
3813,4,11,Clean Garrison,You must face me at last. [the two of them just stare at each other]
3814,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,You aren't real! You can't be!
3815,4,11,Clean Garrison,"It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate."
3816,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,What do you want?
3817,4,11,Clean Garrison,"I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all."
3818,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,Why?
3819,4,11,Clean Garrison,"Don't you see? [approached the unkempt one] All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are. [his voice softens] Of who... we are."
3820,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!
3821,4,11,Clean Garrison,"Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!"
3822,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,I was just comparing size!
3823,4,11,Clean Garrison,For seven minutes?!
3824,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,Aaa! [turns away in despair]
3825,4,11,Clean Garrison,And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?!
3826,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,I was beating off to the chicks!
3827,4,11,Clean Garrison,THERE WERE NO CHICKS!
3828,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,"OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!"
3829,4,11,Clean Garrison,ADMIT IT!
3830,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,NO!!!
3831,4,11,Clean Garrison,YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G-
3832,4,11,Unkempt Garrison,"ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!! [camera zooms in as Garrison comes to terms with this admission] I'm...gay. I'm gay! [rises] I am gay! You hear that everyone? [goes towards the exit] I'm gay! I'm gay! I'm gay and it... [gets emotional] and it feels good."
3833,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, children, I hope you all did your- [the class once again has goggles on and the two nerds are back together in the back of the class ready to activate another machine --- a microwave oven with a duck tied to it.] Oowhat is going on now?! [three kittens run up and frolic near her breasts]"
3834,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me."
3835,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"[cups her ears] Oh Good Gravy, not this again."
3836,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck [the contraption is shown and the duck quacks.] Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? [the nerds activate their controllers]"
3837,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Children, I will have order!!"
3838,4,11,Nerd 1,I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica!
3839,4,11,Nerd 2,There WEREN'T!
3840,4,11,Nerd 1,"The episode called ""Gonzo on Ice Planet Zero"" was a two-parter."
3841,4,11,Nerd 2,No it WASN'T!
3842,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh, son of a bitch!"
3843,4,11,Nerd 1,"I'll kill you! [the nerds start slapping each other again. Nerd #2 throws his controller at Nerd #1, and the controller hits the floor. The microwave is activated and soon blows up along with the bird, leaving behind a portal]"
3844,4,11,Eric Cartman,"There it is! Come on, everybody! [the kids move towards the portal]"
3845,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Children, get back into your seats!"
3846,4,11,Eric Cartman,"No way, lady!"
3847,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Eric, I mean it!"
3848,4,11,Eric Cartman,You can suck my balls!
3849,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"[strikes a meditative pose as the camera does some vertigo, then] Present them. [everyone stops what they're doing and looks at her. Nerd #2 was about to strike Nerd #1 with a desk.]"
3850,4,11,Eric Cartman,...What?
3851,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"You said, ""suck my balls."" Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em."
3852,4,11,Stan Marsh,[softly] Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
3853,4,11,Eric Cartman,"Touché, teacher. Touché."
3854,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?"
3855,4,11,Stan Marsh,Dude. Sh-she's right.
3856,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either."
3857,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!"
3858,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! You suck, Cartman! [the kids return to their seats, leaving Cartman alone]"
3859,4,11,Eric Cartman,What??
3860,4,11,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade. [as she turns to write her name on the makeshift board, a noise is heard]"
3861,4,11,Timmy Burch,AAAAAAA! [reappears covered in items from every time period in history]
3862,4,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Timmy's back!"
3863,4,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us."
3864,4,11,Timmy Burch,"[shifts a bit here and there] Eh, Timmih."
3865,4,11,Chef,"You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. [the door opens]"
3866,4,11,Mr Garrison,"[skips in happily] Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!! [the other three look]"
3867,4,11,Principal Victoria,Mr. Garrison?
3868,4,11,Mr Mackey,What?
3869,4,11,Mr Garrison,I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
3870,4,11,Principal Victoria,You admit it? You admit it! [the three of them gather around him smiling]
3871,4,11,Mr Mackey,"Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!"
3872,4,11,Mr Garrison,"[fairly bouncing with joy] Yeah, it feels really good!"
3873,4,11,Principal Victoria,"Well, congratulations!"
3874,4,11,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, congratulations!"
3875,4,11,Mr Garrison,"You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!"
3876,4,11,Principal Victoria,"Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people. [silence, then Chef, Mr. Mackey, and Principal Victoria laugh as Mr. Garrison stews]"
3877,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what's your little brother doing here?"
3878,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
3879,4,12,Stan Marsh,But isn't he only three years old?
3880,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten."
3881,4,12,Ike Broflovski,I pooped my pants.
3882,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[moves Ike aside and shows his folder] But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper. [opens it up and displays the inside] It has five different compartments for each subject in school, [closes it and shows off the covers] and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek."
3883,4,12,Stan Marsh,Cool!
3884,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[walks up with his own folder] Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000. [slight pause. Kyle reacts] Yeah, well, [opens his up] it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, [opens it up again] flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar."
3885,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Wow, cool!"
3886,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!"
3887,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase."
3888,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
3889,4,12,Eric Cartman,He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
3890,4,12,Ike Broflovski,I pooped my pants!
3891,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--"
3892,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. [soft music plays and Cartman starts to dance]"
3893,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! [music continues, and the bus rolls up]"
3894,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus."
3895,4,12,Ms Crabtree,Sit down and shut up!!
3896,4,12,Stan Marsh,But they smell like pee.
3897,4,12,Man,[in European accent] I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.
3898,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,You are?
3899,4,12,Man,Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.
3900,4,12,Stan Marsh,Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
3901,4,12,Bill,"I was held back ten human grades. [grimaces and grunts] I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?"
3902,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that's me."
3903,4,12,Bill,Eric Cartman?  And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
3904,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeahhh, you already know about it?"
3905,4,12,Bill,"Yes. Yes, I do."
3906,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Well... [mocking] ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"""
3907,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
3908,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?"
3909,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I don't! I don't care!"
3910,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[stick the notebook out] Here, Kyle. [Bill stares at Cartman's Trapper Keeper]"
3911,4,12,Boy 1,"Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius."
3912,4,12,Boy 2,"Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten."
3913,4,12,Boy 1,"Come on. [The two boys walk up to Ike and sit on the chairs on either side of him] So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?"
3914,4,12,Ike Broflovski,Unkoo baba.
3915,4,12,Mr Garrison,"[enters the room] Okay, children, let's take our seats. [closes the door and approaches the table] My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little [wags the index and ring finger of each hand] ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of ""rat carcasses"". [a view of some of the kids' reactions] But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten. [a view of other kids' reactions] But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it? [the kids look confused] No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?"
3916,4,12,Filmore Anderson,Here.
3917,4,12,Mr Garrison,Sally Bands?
3918,4,12,"Kindergarteners

 Flora",Here.
3919,4,12,Mr Garrison,Ike Broflovski?
3920,4,12,Ike Broflovski,Cookie Monster.
3921,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too. [Fillmore and his friend glare at Ike] Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. [Ike looks at Filmore and friend and starts to sink in his seat]"
3922,4,12,Eric Cartman,And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically. [Kyle glares at him with arms crossed.] I can take something as simple as this calculator [a Wellington Bear model] and... Trapper Keeper?
3923,4,12,Trapper Keeper,[its TV screen turns on] Trapper Keeper active.
3924,4,12,Eric Cartman,Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
3925,4,12,Trapper Keeper,Ready for hybrid. [Two cables reach out and grab the calculator and pull it into a ready slot. Cartman closes the Trapper Keeper]
3926,4,12,Eric Cartman,"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too."
3927,4,12,Kids,Wow.
3928,4,12,Bill,[reaches over Cartman's shoulder] May I hold your Trapper Keeper?
3929,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers. [wiggles them outstretched] If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands."
3930,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!"
3931,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh really? [hands the folder over to Kyle] Then, why don't you hold it? [Kyle looks at it in Cartman's outstretched hand.] Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it. [inches closer and whispers] Hold it."
3932,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,I'm gonna!
3933,4,12,Eric Cartman,[inches closer and whispers] Hold it.
3934,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,I will!
3935,4,12,Mr Garrison,"And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better. [some of the kids are stunned. Garrison starts writing on the board] Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president, [writes up ""KINDERGARTEN CLASS PRESIDENT"" on the chalkboard and underlines it] so first we must pick nominees. [turns and faces the class] Who would like to nominate someone?"
3936,4,12,Boy 2,"I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class."
3937,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, Filmore. [writes the name on the board] You'll be our first nominee. And who else? [a girl raises her hand] Yes, Jenny."
3938,4,12,Jenny,I gotta go doodie.
3939,4,12,Mr Garrison,"In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president? [the kids stay quiet] Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius."
3940,4,12,Ike Broflovski,[looks at an angry Fillmore and friend] No.
3941,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius. [writes the name up on the board. Filmore and friend stare at a chagrined Ike] Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?"
3942,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"[leaves his seat, approaches the board, and faces the class] If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you. [returns to his seat]"
3943,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?"
3944,4,12,Ike Broflovski,"[leaves his seat, approaches the board, and faces the class] Cookie Monster. Ice."
3945,4,12,Mr Garrison,"...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids."
3946,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid."
3947,4,12,Bill,"Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend? [winces] I mean, friend?"
3948,4,12,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once."
3949,4,12,Bill,"Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square-- [coughs up] I mean, four square."
3950,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me."
3951,4,12,Bill,"Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!"
3952,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that's cool."
3953,4,12,Bill,[holds up the tetherball] Can we play some human tetherball?
3954,4,12,Eric Cartman,"A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- [by this time, ""Bill"" has pulled away from the pole and Cartman, and has the tether taut and ready to release]"
3955,4,12,Bill,"Serve! [whips the ball at Cartman, knocking him onto his back. The Trapper Keeper falls away and lands next to Kenny. ""Bill"" makes his move]"
3956,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Ugh..! [""Bill"" goes after the Trapper Keeper and runs away with it]"
3957,4,12,Bill,Got it!
3958,4,12,Eric Cartman,Ey!
3959,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! [just then, spikes come out of the Trapper Keeper and some of them go clear through ""Bill's"" hands.]"
3960,4,12,Bill,[stops and looks at his pierced hands] Waa-agggh! [clenches his teeth and continues running]
3961,4,12,Eric Cartman,"You son of a bitch! [recalls something] Wait a minute. [whips out a small gadget and activates it] Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. [walks towards the source of the sound heard in the device and away from his friends]"
3962,4,12,Stan Marsh,[confused] What the hell just happened?
3963,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,[angry] Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
3964,4,12,Mr Garrison,"So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike. [sets the chalk down and reads the last ballot] And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for. [Flora, a timid, pretty blond girl trying to bury her face into her laps, which are raised up on the chair, is shown] You've got the winning vote, Flora.

3979,4,12,Girl,I want Ike to be president! [several kids from Filmore's side rush across the table to kids on Ike's side]
3980,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!"
3981,4,12,Eric Cartman,Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
3982,4,12,Officer Barbrady,"Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder."
3983,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[grabs Barbrady's ] It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if-- [spots ""Bill""] There he is!"
3984,4,12,Bill,[turns to see the cruiser coming his way] Wagh!
3985,4,12,Eric Cartman,Got ya! [grabs the steering wheel from Barbrady]
3986,4,12,Officer Barbrady,"Hey! [Cartman steers the cruiser into a building, crushing ""Bill"" and rattling the building]"
3987,4,12,Bill,"Gaagghhh! [crumples to the floor. Barbrady and the others exit the car and gather at Bill. His left arm has been amputated, revealing functioning wires. The lower half holding the Trapper Keeper in hand. Barbrady and the boys stare in shock]"
3988,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude..!"
3989,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?"
3990,4,12,Bill,Please. You do not understand.
3991,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[takes his place] Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done."
3992,4,12,Bill,[plaintive] That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!
3993,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?"
3994,4,12,Officer Barbrady,Bill Cosby?
3995,4,12,Bill,Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby. [the boys and Barbrady show shock] My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.
3996,4,12,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!"
3997,4,12,BSM 471,"I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world. [cables reach out from the Trapper Keeper and engulf two computers. The process continues engulfing all of the US] It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind [skulls litter the landscape] and there was nothing the humans could do. [in the distance a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper tower rises] It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans. [people are shot left and right from the Trapper Keeper's weapons] The nations tried everything to stop it. [troops line up and fire at the Trapper Keeper] Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked. [robotic tanks come into view, firing away at the Trapper Keeper] The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them. [DC TK209s approach the advancing armies and fire at them] But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper. [the battle scene fades, and BSM-471 is shown once again on the ground] And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started."
3998,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Wow, that's amazing."
3999,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast."
4000,4,12,Stan Marsh,"What do you think, Officer Barbrady?"
4001,4,12,Officer Barbrady,"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening."
4002,4,12,BSM 471,"And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper."
4003,4,12,Eric Cartman,[long pause] You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
4004,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!"
4005,4,12,Eric Cartman,"What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!"
4006,4,12,Stan Marsh,Yes!
4007,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Aw, damnit! [throws his Trapper Keeper to the ground] Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! [walks off to his left sadly]"

4013,4,12,Filmore Anderson,We want a recount.
4014,4,12,Mr Garrison,[miffed] What?
4015,4,12,Filmore s Supporters,Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!
4016,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby! [Filmore cries and throws a tantrum, pounding away on the classroom table] Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore... [writes Filmore's name on the board. A time lapse shows him writing on a crowded board now] ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike."
4017,4,12,Filmore Anderson,Count them again.
4018,4,12,Supporters,Yeah!
4019,4,12,Mr Garrison,"No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!"
4020,4,12,Kid 2,"Wait, there's still that absent kid."
4021,4,12,Fillmore,"Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote."
4022,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, will you grow up?!"
4023,4,12,Supporters,[clamoring] Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count!
4024,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home! [the kids leave]"

4026,4,12,Stan Kyle,"Hey, Bill Cosby."
4027,4,12,BSM 471,"I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada."
4028,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,That should do it.
4029,4,12,Stan Marsh,"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?"
4030,4,12,BSM 471,"Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right."
4031,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[walks up with another Trapper Keeper] Hey, dudes."
4032,4,12,Stan Marsh,Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
4033,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one! [holds it up high] So everything worked out."
4034,4,12,BSM 471,[frightened] Oh no!
4035,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!"
4036,4,12,Eric Cartman,Why the hell not?!
4037,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!"
4038,4,12,Eric Cartman,Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
4039,4,12,BSM 471,We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
4040,4,12,Eric Cartman,[holds his Trapper Keeper close] But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
4041,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!"
4042,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. [moves off to his left]"
4043,4,12,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
4044,4,12,Eric Cartman,Ech! Screw you guys. Home. [walks away]

4047,4,12,BSM 471,"I'm afraid I have no other choice. [pulls the phaser back] For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him."
4048,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh... Okay.
4049,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's fine. [""Bill"" aims the phaser once again] No, wait!"
4050,4,12,BSM 471,What?
4051,4,12,Stan Marsh,Can I do it?
4052,4,12,BSM 471,"Oh, well, I suppose. [tosses the phaser to Stan]"
4053,4,12,Stan Marsh,"[takes it and quickly aims] Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!"
4054,4,12,BSM 471,"Wait! [grabs it back] Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother."
4055,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him."
4056,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that'd be faster."
4057,4,12,Stan Marsh,He's right there.
4058,4,12,BSM 471,"I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call ""compassion"". It is an amazing feeling!"

4083,4,12,Liane Cartman,"Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. [starts flirting with him]"
4084,4,12,BSM 471,Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
4085,4,12,Liane Cartman,"In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? [pulls ""Bill"" from the chair]"
4086,4,12,Stan Marsh,Uh-oh.
4087,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Here we go again.
4088,4,12,Liane Cartman,"Come this way, Billy. [takes him away from the table]"
4089,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. [he and Kenny leave the table, with Kyle following]"
4090,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--"
4091,4,12,Stan Marsh,"[knocks on the door] Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! [Cartman hops off his chair and dances to the door. He locks it and continues singing]"
4092,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--"
4093,4,12,Trapper Keeper,"Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb."
4094,4,12,Eric Cartman,Huh? [walks towards his computer]
4095,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[in the hallway, pounds on the door] Dammit, Cartman, open up!"
4096,4,12,Trapper Keeper,"Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid."
4097,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? [cables come from the monitor and grab him] Ugh--!"
4098,4,12,Stan Marsh,"[pounds on the door] Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. [he and Kyle now notice the groans coming from the room]"
4099,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman? [inside, cables wrap tight around his face and go in, transforming his body into a grotesque hybrid, and the hybrid begins to grow] He's not gonna open it. Break it down."
4100,4,12,Stan Marsh,You break it down!
4101,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!"
4102,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Not it! You lose, Kenny. [he and Kyle quickly step out of the way]"
4103,4,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Awww..!) [goes to the far wall and then rushes the door, only to be plastered against the far wall...] (Argh--!) [...by the unhinged bedroom door being pushed out by the evolving Trapper Keeper. The boys are frozen in place with mouths open]"
4104,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
4105,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,You ba--! [the boys make a run for it down the hall and down the stairs as the Trapper Keeper oozes out of Cartman's room]
4106,4,12,Stan Kyle,"Agggghhh! [the Trapper Keeper bursts through every window in the house and then the house begins to crumble around it. It collapses in on itself. moves away from the house, leaving ""Bill"" and Liane in bed fully exposed to the elements]"
4107,4,12,Liane Cartman,"[on top] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!"
4108,4,12,Mr Garrison,"What the hell is that? [walks to the window and looks out] Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom! [some of the kids slink down in their seats] Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. [the doorknob turns and the kindergartners crouch in terror]"
4109,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"Hello, kids!"
4110,4,12,Filmore Anderson,Aunt Rosie!
4111,4,12,Mr Garrison,"[in a panic] Run for your lives, children! [grabs a bat] I'll try to fight it off!"
4112,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell."
4113,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well."
4114,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?"
4115,4,12,Filmore Anderson,Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.
4116,4,12,Ike Supporter,"No, Ike won."
4117,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--"
4118,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it my way!"
4119,4,12,Trapper Keeper,[now with Cartman's voice] We are Trapper Keeper.
4120,4,12,BSM 471,[on a bluff with Stan and Kyle looking at the Trapper Keeper leave town] Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
4121,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Why is that bad?
4122,4,12,BSM 471,It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
4123,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Then we have to stop it before it gets there! [leads the others off the bluff and onto a waiting cruiser. ""Bill"" takes the wheel and Kyle takes the passenger window seat]"
4124,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Step on it, Bill Cosby! [""Bill"" starts the cruiser and drives off]"
4125,4,12,Guard 2,"Hey, Mark, look."
4126,4,12,Mark,"Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. [a police siren is heard, and promptly ""Bill"" arrives with Stan and Kyle. They hop out of the car and face the Trapper Keeper]"
4127,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you have to stop!"
4128,4,12,Trapper Keeper,We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.
4129,4,12,BSM 471,"A part of your friend must still be alive in there. [the three of them study the Trapper Keeper from a distance until Stan finds a ventilation hose coming out of it. Smoke comes out of it, and a fart is heard]"
4130,4,12,Stan Marsh,He is in there.
4131,4,12,BSM 471,"That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU."
4132,4,12,Stan Marsh,"One-two-three, not it!"
4133,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Not-- Aw, damnit..! [walks up to the hissing hose and climbs in]"
4134,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[à la HAL 9000] What are you doing, Kyle?"
4135,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU."
4136,4,12,Eric Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle."
4137,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Screw you, fat ass!"
4138,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, screw you."
4139,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman! [hits a wall with a wrench]
4140,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]"
4141,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,No!
4142,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"[sits on a chair with Filmore on her lap] Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--"
4143,4,12,Mr Garrison,"[throws a fit] Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it! [the kids and Rosie look at him] Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year."
4144,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated.
4145,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds! [Rosie and the kids gasp] ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids."
4146,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"How dare you?! I will not be preached at by a country pumpkin! [heads for the door and stands at the entrance] I'm leaving this podunk town, but in my place I'm gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and press than you have ever seen! [exits and slams the door shut]"
4147,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse."
4148,4,12,Ladies,"Aaghh! [hurry away. The Trapper Keeper absorbs the phone booth, and another of its appendages goes after a police car]"
4149,4,12,Cops,"Wagghh! [hurry away. In the distance ""Bill,"" the two security guards, and Stan watch Trapper Keeper get bigger and bigger. Behind them, the rest of South Park gathers and sees the spectacle]"
4150,4,12,Mark,Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this. [whips out a walkie-talkie and starts] Car one to base-- [another appendage reaches down and pulls him up and away] Aghh! [Trapper Keeper swallows him up]
4151,4,12,BSM 471,It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
4152,4,12,Stan Marsh,Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
4153,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,I can't reach the CPU.
4154,4,12,Rosie O'Donnell,What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!
4155,4,12,Guard 2,"Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!"
4156,4,12,Stan Marsh,"No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. [an indecisive appendage hovers over Rosie]"
4157,4,12,Guard 2,Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.
4158,4,12,Rosie O'Donnell,"[to Trapper Keeper] I said, get out of my way! [another appendage wraps around her and tries to pull her in] Aaaaggghhhh!!! [Trapper Keeper swells and heaves, and the fleshy appendage swallows Rosie up] Ogh. Noo-- [the appendage pulls her up and into Trapper Keeper]"
4159,4,12,Trapper Keeper,Eeww.
4160,4,12,BSM 471,Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
4161,4,12,Trapper Keeper,Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie... [begins to deflate and wither. Its appendages wither and begin to drop off as it darkens]
4162,4,12,Stan Marsh,"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!"
4163,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Got 'em!
4164,4,12,Stan Marsh,He did it!
4165,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? [the door opens, and in walks...]"
4166,4,12,Jesse Jackson,Is this the kindergarten classroom?
4167,4,12,Mr Garrison,Jesse Jackson?
4168,4,12,Jesse Jackson,That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!
4169,4,12,Mr Garrison,[covering his face] We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
4170,4,12,Jesse Jackson,Oh. Bye. [turns and walks out. Filmore raises his hand]
4171,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--"
4172,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"Mistoreh Garrison, I concede. [Mr. Garrison's jaw drops, as do those of Filmore's lawyers]"
4173,4,12,Mr Garrison,"You... yuh, you what?"
4174,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid."
4175,4,12,"Kindergarteners 
 Jenny
 Sally Bands
 Billy Harris
 Flora",Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.
4176,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"Ike, you could be class president."
4177,4,12,Ike Broflovski,I pooped my pants!
4178,4,12,"Kindergarteners 
 Jenny
 Sally Bands
 Billy Harris
 Flora",[throws up her hands] Can we fingerpaint now?
4179,4,12,Kids,[clamoring] Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint!
4180,4,12,Mr Garrison,Ohuh... Yes. [exults] Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
4181,4,12,Stan Marsh,"You did it, Kyle! [to Cartman] Kyle saved your life, fat ass!"
4182,4,12,BSM 471,Look! I'm fading! [begins to fade from view] It must have worked. I don't exist! [disappears]
4183,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Huh, that's a bitch."
4184,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home."
4185,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!"
4186,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Awww, man..."
4187,4,12,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
4188,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright. [sighs] Kyle..."
4189,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),"Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?"
4190,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak."
4191,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),Oh no! NO!
4192,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),"'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do."
4193,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),My poor little Helen.
4194,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"[enters through the prop door in blue dress and wig, and holding a doll - Helen Keller!] Timmiihhh!"
4195,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),"She can't see or hear us, John."
4196,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"Heh-aaaah, Timmih!"
4197,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),[very slurred - John Keller] E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
4198,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[in the second front row, directing] Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!"
4199,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
4200,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,Can we take a lunch break now?
4201,4,13,Eric Cartman,"No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!"
4202,4,13,Bebe Stevens (Anne Sullivan),"[enters the scene] Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate."
4203,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
4204,4,13,Bebe Stevens (Anne Sullivan),"[slaps some water from a pitcher into Timmy's right hand] Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!"
4205,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"Agh oh-ight, Timmih!"
4206,4,13,Eric Cartman,"God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!"
4207,4,13,Butters Stotch,[a camera follows him to the auditorium at butt level; another camera shows him entering the room] Hey you guys! We got a big problem! [rushes onto the stage]
4208,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What is it, Butters?"
4209,4,13,Butters Stotch,"The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!"
4210,4,13,Eric Cartman,How good?
4211,4,13,Butters Stotch,"They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!"
4212,4,13,Clyde Donovan,"Oh, no!"
4213,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
4214,4,13,Clyde Donovan,"Oh, now what?"
4215,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),"Oh yeah, we can't!"
4216,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!"
4217,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
4218,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too."
4219,4,13,Clyde Donovan,"Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?"
4220,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),"I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey."
4221,4,13,Token Black,"Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks."
4222,4,13,Kids,Yeah
4223,4,13,Eric Cartman,"That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!"
4224,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,Okay!
4225,4,13,Eric Cartman,This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
4226,4,13,Kids,Yay!
4227,4,13,Rancher,What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
4228,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"A smart one, that can do tricks."
4229,4,13,Rancher,"Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all. [opens a turkey pen so the boys can see] Go ahead, just pick one out. [Timmy looks pleased, looks around, and settles on a deformed turkey which walks with its head against the ground]"
4230,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[apparently having chosen his turkey] Timmaay! [the turkey blinks at him]
4231,4,13,Rancher,"[notices the turkey] Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter."
4232,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Haaaaa!
4233,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!"
4234,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),TIMMAY!
4235,4,13,Rancher,Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
4236,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!"
4237,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
4238,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, we'll take him. How much?"
4239,4,13,Rancher,Fifty bucks.
4240,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
4241,4,13,Rancher,I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
4242,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinks] ...God-damnit, here! [the rancher takes the money, walks over to get the turkey, and delivers the turkey to Timmy] Alright, Timmy, let's go! [Kyle and Timmy leave]"
4243,4,13,Rancher,"I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too."
4244,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, blow it out your ass!"
4245,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks."
4246,4,13,Kids,[flatly] Bravo.
4247,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
4248,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),[lyrically] I would swear it on my life. Your play shall want for nothing.
4249,4,13,Kids,Hooray!
4250,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show."
4251,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey! [Timmy's turkey sidles in with its head on the ground. Kyle and Timmy follow] What the hell is that?"
4252,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,It's a turkey. [long pause] His name is Gobbles.
4253,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),GOBBLES! [Gobbles gobbles]
4254,4,13,Eric Cartman,And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
4255,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one..."
4256,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),GOBBLES! [Gobbles gobbles]
4257,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[looks at Kyle for a long time] Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second? [they walk off to one side of the stage and stop, out of earshot] Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?"
4258,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
4259,4,13,Eric Cartman,"You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"""
4260,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[the rest of the cast approaches] Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it."
4261,4,13,,"He's not gonna work, Kyle. The whole point was to make our play better than the kindergartners."
4262,4,13,Token Black,"Yeah, that turkey sucks."
4263,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"[lyrically] Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey."
4264,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),You do?
4265,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),[lyrically] During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire.
4266,4,13,Eric Cartman,Cool! Can you get it for us?
4267,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey.
4268,4,13,Kids,Alright! [Timmy takes Gobbles and wheels off stage]
4269,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"Gobbles! [shows him the hoop and points to it. Gobbles just blinks. Timmy tries again] Gobbles! [Gobbles blinks, then walks up to the hoop and lifts his head through it. Timmy is dismayed] Up, heh. Uh! [coaxes Gobbles through the hoop. Gobbles trips and falls out. Timmy grins] Heeey, Gobbles! [Gobbles gets up and walks away. Timmy pulls out a lighter and sets the hoop aflame] Gobbles. [Gobbles just stares and Timmy urges] Gobbles! [Gobbles poops]"
4270,4,13,Eric Cartman,"No no! [tosse another sheet over his shoulder, to join other wads on the floor. His mother enters the room]"
4271,4,13,Liane,"Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed."
4272,4,13,Eric Cartman,"I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!"
4273,4,13,Liane,"Now, hon!"
4274,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[whining a bit] But [turns around] Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man."
4275,4,13,Liane,"Twenty more minutes, and that's it. [exits and closes the door]"
4276,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[spins around and gets back to work] Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?! [looks at a small portrait of Helen Keller on his desk, picks it up and studies it] Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice. [after looking at the portrait some more, he gets frustrated and slams the portrait onto the desk] Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!"
4277,4,13,Clyde Donovan,Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
4278,4,13,Eric Cartman,[in the audience] OP-pression!
4279,4,13,Clyde Donovan,"Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time. [music comes up] Alabama, in the late 1800s [spotlight goes off, Clyde walks off stage, curtains open. A lone house stands against a desert background and clouds float high against the sky-blue backdrop. Dancing singers begin]"
4280,4,13,Actors,"\
1800's, Alabama! What a great place and time!
We're so happy that we live in 1800's Alabama 'cause it's sunny and there is no crime!"
4281,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),[in the audience] Now to the refrain!
4282,4,13,Actors,"And in this little town in 1800's Alabama there's a family by the name of Keller!
[They dance off to one side of the house. A water pump appears]
Their daughter's deaf and mute and blind as a bat, and her parents can't even tell her!!"
4283,4,13,Lamond,"[a man with a small animal cage enters] Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal trainer."
4284,4,13,Clyde Donovan,Oh. [quickly calls the others] Cool! He's here! [the other kids gather]
4285,4,13,Eric Cartman,Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
4286,4,13,Lamond,"Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America! [sets the cage down] Four-time prize winner of the National Western Stock Show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! I give you Alinicia! [one serious turkey walks out of the cage, and the kids are impressed]"
4287,4,13,Eric Cartman,Yeh.
4288,4,13,Others,Wow.
4289,4,13,Eric Cartman,Whoa.
4290,4,13,Bebe Stevens (Anne Sullivan),Her feathers are beautiful.
4291,4,13,Clyde Donovan,That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.
4292,4,13,Lamond,Of course she is! [she looks back at the kids and thrusts her beak in the air]
4293,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody! [the kids move back...] Where the hell is Timmy?"
4294,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[off screen] TIM-MIH! [all turn and face him. He's in costume with Gobbles before him. Gobbles raises his head and gobbles]
4295,4,13,Lamond,What... is... that?!
4296,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. [Timmy takes his lighter and sets his hoop on fire, then lowers it for his bird]"
4297,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Gobbles! [Gobbles makes no move] Gobbles?!
4298,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Timmy, we already got a turkey."
4299,4,13,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah, and it's from Broadway."
4300,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[indicates his turkey] Gobbles.
4301,4,13,Eric Cartman,"No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!"
4302,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off."
4303,4,13,Eric Cartman,"No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part."
4304,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[stubborn] Tim-mih.
4305,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! [Alinicia protests vigorously, shedding feathers everywhere]"
4306,4,13,Lamond,My turkey does not work with other turkeys!
4307,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!"
4308,4,13,Lamond,"Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright. [exits and closes the door]"
4309,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[walks up] Dude, we need your turkey for our play!"
4310,4,13,Lamond,She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!
4311,4,13,Eric Cartman,"I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?"
4312,4,13,Lamond,[ominously] Kill the other turkey!
4313,4,13,Eric Cartman,I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
4314,4,13,Lamond,"Well, it could meet with ""an unfortunate accident."""
4315,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show? [laughs, but realizes he's alone in this] Oh."
4316,4,13,Lamond,"It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!"
4317,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. [walks off]"
4318,4,13,Bebe Stevens (Anne Sullivan),"[enunciating] Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?"
4319,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"Dehh haaa. [unimpressed looks from Cartman, Jeffrey, and Lamond]"
4320,4,13,Bebe Stevens (Anne Sullivan),"Water, Helen, Water."
4321,4,13,Kids,She's never gonna do it. There's no way she'll ever do it.
4322,4,13,Bebe Stevens (Anne Sullivan),"Helen, Helen. Water, Helen."
4323,4,13,Kids,How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!
4324,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second. [whisks himself onstage] Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2 [starts moving Gobbles along] stand just a little bit more over... [puts it behind the Comedy Central logo] here. [mulls over the position] Let's see, maybe a little more up in here. [moves it a bit towards stage center] And just a wee bit over here. [Gobbles is back behind the logo, a bit] And right about... [moves Gobbles a bit back] hm'ere. [steps back] There we go. Good. [goes off stage. A cable whips out of place somewhere. A lighting fixture falls on Kenny and kills him]"
4325,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
4326,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),Whoa-aaaa [dances away]
4327,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!"
4328,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"[onstage, walks up to Kenny's corpse, then gets lyrical] Let him rest in peace. Let him rest. Why must he die?"
4329,4,13,Butters Stotch,[a camera follows him to the auditorium at butt level; another camera shows him entering the room] They've got special effects! [Jeffrey continues singing in the background]
4330,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,What Butters? [Butters meets the others onstage]
4331,4,13,Butters Stotch,"The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!"
4332,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),"Oh, no!"
4333,4,13,Clyde Donovan,We're never gonna outdo them now! [the kids begin to chatter amongst themselves]
4334,4,13,Token Black,But what are we gonna do?
4335,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[Jeffrey continues his dirge] Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work! [looks at Lamond] All of us! [Lamond crosses his arms]"
4336,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"—and into your hands [the kids now pay attention to him] uh he... buh... [hums, then stops singing, stares, then gets up and walks offstage]"
4337,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"Gobbles! [Gobbles lifts his head and drops it away from Timmy] Hu-ugh, Gobbles! [they hear the door open. Timmy puts the hoop away and gathers Gobbles on his lap]"
4338,4,13,Lamond,[peeks in] Little boy.
4339,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[spins around] Timmy.
4340,4,13,Lamond,"Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you. [walks up to Timmy] The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you?"
4341,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),T-Timmih? [a bit afraid]
4342,4,13,Lamond,I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you. [genuflects next to Timmy] The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkey away from you.
4343,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Gobbles? [scared]
4344,4,13,Lamond,"You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away."
4345,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Gobbles!
4346,4,13,Lamond,"They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and flayed while they're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild. [listens for something] Oh no! Here they come now! [two men round the corner] Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them."
4347,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[turns and wheels away from the oncoming men] T-tim-mih.
4348,4,13,Installer,"Eh, excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical?"
4349,4,13,Lamond,"Uh, the stage is right through there."
4350,4,13,Installer,Thanks. [he and his partner walk towards the stage. Lamond looks after them as they leave]
4351,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see. [writes] no [writes] No. [writes] NO! [writes] God-damnit [takes the sheet and squeezes it into a wad]"
4352,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"[enters the room] How is it going, Eric?"
4353,4,13,Eric Cartman,Terrible! [turns and faces Jeffrey] I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
4354,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing."
4355,4,13,Eric Cartman,Like what?
4356,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),Let's see. [closes the door behind him] Helen Keller was blind and deaf. [walks to Cartman's side desk] Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here. [turns Cartman around and puts a blindfold on him.]
4357,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Hey, that's not a bad idea."
4358,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),[puts some headphones on him] Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow... [a long pause. then a series of images present themselves]
4359,4,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man!"
4360,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"Well, did you see anything?"
4361,4,13,Eric Cartman,"No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes."
4362,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"...Oh, that's too bad."
4363,4,13,Eric Cartman,Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire! [starts writing furiously] Yes! Yes! I have it now!
4364,4,13,Lamond,[his head appears beside Timmy] The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go... [fades as it echoes] let him go... let him go...[the head disappears]
4365,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"[stops and lets Gobbles go] Gobbles! [points away so Gobbles could leave. Gobbles moves his head in that direction, but nothing else] Gobbles!! [turns around and rolls away. Gobbles follows him and gobbles. Timmy turns around again and face Gobbles] Gobbles. Gobbles! [points away again, turns and rolls away. Gobbles follows some more] Timmih. [a tear appears in his eye] Timmih, Gobbles. [turns away and rolls off, leaving Gobbles alone. The camera pulls back and moves to the first house on the right side. A man and son sit on their doorway]"
4366,4,13,Boy,"Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven?"
4367,4,13,Father,"She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice."
4368,4,13,Boy,But I miss her. [father and son start to cry. The camera moves to a bench on which two men sit]
4369,4,13,Elderly man,"[his middle-aged son comforts him] I could have so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it, not ever telling you and Mark that I love you. [both men start to cry. The camera moves to Heidi Turner crying over a dead dog.]"
4370,4,13,Heidi Turner,"Robby! Robby, no! [cries uncontrollably. The camera moves to a couple in discord. the woman is sad]"
4371,4,13,Woman,"...Because now, every time I look at you [he tries to console her], I see her! [she swats his arm away] I have to move on."
4372,4,13,Man,"Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry."
4373,4,13,Kelly,Then why did you do it?? [breaks down and sobs]
4374,4,13,Man,"I don't know! [beings to cry, too, and rests his head on her shoulder. The camera moves to a lady with something to say]"
4375,4,13,Lady,Have you done the right things in your life? [the camera looks up into the sky as it fades into night]
4376,4,13,Sharon Marsh,"Hi, Sheila."
4377,4,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?"
4378,4,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance."
4379,4,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, so did Gerald. [indeed, all the husbands are in the back of the theatre with video cameras at the ready]"
4380,4,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh yeah, I got a great angle here."
4381,4,13,Randy Marsh,"Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both."
4382,4,13,Gerald Broflovski,Good idea.
4383,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
4384,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),"No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. [Timmy rolls slowly in ]"
4385,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You ready for the big show, Timmy?"
4386,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),"Where's Gobbles, Timmy?"
4387,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Gobbles.
4388,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[cheerfully] Alright everybody, let's take our places!"
4389,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?"
4390,4,13,Eric Cartman,"I don't know. [Stan and Kyle cross their arms] I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole."
4391,4,13,Lamond,"You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show! [Alinicia gobbles]"
4392,4,13,Driver,"[walks up to collect Gobbles] Well, well, what are doing out here? [picks him up] You shouldn't be out walking the streets. [opens his truck, tosses Gobbles in, and rushes to the cab of the truck. The side of the truck reads, ""Uncle Joe's Fresh Turkey. Succulent and Juicy Turkeys,"" with a plump turkey in the background. The driver takes off quickly]"
4393,4,13,Mr Garrison,"Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant."
4394,4,13,Mr Mackey,"[bored, rests his head on his hand] Every year the fourth graders do ""The Miracle Worker,"" and every year I have to sit and watch it."
4395,4,13,Principal Victoria,"Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head. [demonstrates with her finger] But luckily I got really stoned before I came."
4396,4,13,Mr Garrison,"And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, ""The Miracle Worker."" [walks off. The parents are seen clapping, and then the curtains open up to reveal kids dancing and doing acrobatic feats]"
4397,4,13,Kids,"Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as a bat.She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?"
4398,4,13,Sheila Broflovski,"This is ""The Miracle Worker""?"
4399,4,13,Sharon Marsh,I... well... maybe. [more dancing follows]
4400,4,13,Principal Victoria,"Oh, oh, haha. Wow."
4401,4,13,Wrangler,[a vertical door rises and he directs the turkeys] Come on. Yaah! Move it!
4402,4,13,Jimbo Kern,"Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey! [Gobbles sees the hunters and tries to run away.] It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! [they pursue Gobbles]"
4403,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),"John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick
[Stan rushes in]
When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch."
4404,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),"No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me."
4405,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),"She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!"
4406,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),Helen!
4407,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),"...Helen! [the audience stares in disbelief]
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!"
4408,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),Oh no! [they lean on each other]
4409,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),"Oh no! Oh no!!! [both collapse to the floor, and the curtains close. Alinicia trots in and gets the spotlight. She then performs her feats. She hops up on a small stand, walks a tightrope, and hops off the stand at the other end. She hops through a hoop and lands on a third stand, then pulls the cover off a sign introducing the next scene: ""Scene 2, Eight Years Later"" and takes a bow. A few people clap]"
4410,4,13,Lamond,She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far. [the two workers approach him]
4411,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up] Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights."
4412,4,13,Installer,"Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union."
4413,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[looks at Cartman] Timmih?
4414,4,13,Eric Cartman,Union Mafia bastards! [Timmy looks at Lamond in fear]
4415,4,13,Lamond,"Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha."
4416,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[throws off his wig and turns to wheel away] Gobbles!! [zips out]
4417,4,13,Eric Cartman,Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
4418,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave."
4419,4,13,Eric Cartman,Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
4420,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),"[approaches the boys] I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on."
4421,4,13,Eric Cartman,"...Alright, fine! Get in costume!"
4422,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Gobbles! Gobbles!
4423,4,13,Jimbo Kern,"[prepares his rifle] There it is! [three other men prepare their rifles] Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot! [aims his rifle and spots the turkey] Here, turkey turkey. [focuses on the turkey]"
4424,4,13,Wendy Testaburger (Mrs. Keller),There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
4425,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),[lyrically] I cannot hear what they are saying. I cannot tell them how I feel.
4426,4,13,Eric Cartman,What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
4427,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),If only I could say things that go on in my mind.
4428,4,13,Principal Victoria,"[touched] Oh, wow."
4429,4,13,Jimbo Kern,That's it. Thaaat's it! [about to pull the trigger]
4430,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Gobbles! [sees Jimbo and is alarmed]
4431,4,13,Jimbo Kern,Gotcha!
4432,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"[Slow motion, jumps out of his chair and dives towards] Gobbles! [flies through the air. Jimbo fires his rifle, and Timmy falls on the floor limp. Jimbo sees what he's done, and all the hunters lower their rifles. Gobble's head pops up behind Timmy. The other hunters whistle and move away slowly, leaving Jimbo and Ned alone. Gobbles walks up to Timmy and nudges him] T-timmih? [Gobbles pokes him] Gobbles? [slowly comes to, then quickly sits up] Gobbles! Haaaah. [brushes himself off and gathers Gobbles up in his arms]"
4433,4,13,Jimbo Kern,"[rushes up to Timmy and is relived that he's okay] Aw, thank God you're alright, kid. [goes down on one knee] It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?"
4434,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),[determined] Timmih.
4435,4,13,Bebe Stevens (Anne Sullivan),"Yes, that's it. [Jeffrey keeps his hand under the water] That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!"
4436,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),Wawa.
4437,4,13,Bebe Stevens (Anne Sullivan),She did it!
4438,4,13,Kids,"[in the background, come forward] She did it! She did it! Water! Water water aaaaaaaa!
Water, Helen, Water.
We can't believe she did it. The dumb kid really did it.
Water, Helen, Water."
4439,4,13,Jeffrey Maynard (Timmy's stand-in),Now that I can communicate the world is not so cold and dark. [Cartman slaps his head and the waterworks begin]
4440,4,13,Kids,"[slowing] Water, Helen, Aaa-aaaaaa!
[the waterworks go up real high and two fountainheads crash into each other]"
4441,4,13,Lamond,"[prepping Alinicia] Here it comes, angel! Your big finale! The audience is going to go wild! [a shadow enters the scene and Lamond looks up. He sees Gobbles and an angry Timmy with arms crossed glaring at him] Oh. Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered your part flawlessly."
4442,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Timmih! [the hunters gather and take aim at Alinicia]
4443,4,13,Jimbo Kern,"Turkey shoot! [the hunters fire away and decimate Alinicia. Her blood spurts all over Lamond, who shields his eyes.]"
4444,4,13,Lamond,"[He falls on one knee at the horror] Alinicia! Jesus, no!"
4445,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"Aaaa, Timmih!"
4446,4,13,Eric Cartman,"[walks up with Kyle] Okay, we're ready for the- [stops in his tracks and stares at the dead Alinicia.] What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!"
4447,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps forward and points] Hey, look! [onstage, Gobbles approaches the ring of fire and steps through it. The kids grin immediately]"
4448,4,13,Principal Victoria,"[in awe] Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh! [starts to clap. The audience soon follows]"
4449,4,13,Eric Cartman,[exults] They loved it! They LOVED it!
4450,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),Gobbles!
4451,4,13,Mr Garrison,"And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, ""Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."""
4452,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),"Okay, here we go. [the kids are still backstage, but in their street clothes]"
4453,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be."
4454,4,13,Kindergartners,"[four little pilgrims enter singing badly to a long table in front of a cabin and a tipi]
It's getting dinner. Let's all eat.
E I E I O.
And on that dinner we'll invite some Indians
E I E I O.
[four little Indians appear and take their seats at the table]
With an Indian here and an Indian there
Everywhere an Indian, Indian. Uh thank, thank-
[something pops by the middle of the table...]"
4455,4,13,Pilgrim Girl,[runs off] Aaaaaaa!
4456,4,13,Kindergartners,Happy Thanksgiving. [another kindergartner wheels a horse prop onstage. The curtains then close]
4457,4,13,Mr Garrison,"Alright, see you next year, parents. [a hush falls over the audience and the actors backstage]"
4458,4,13,Eric Cartman,That's it?
4459,4,13,Stan Marsh (John Keller),We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
4460,4,13,Kyle Broflovski,Butters told us their play was awesome! [the kids move away from Butters a bit]
4461,4,13,Butters Stotch,"...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!"
4462,4,13,Timmy (Helen Keller),"Gobbles, deh!"
4463,4,14,A British Person (Malcolm McDowell),"[seated in an armchair reading a book] Aaah. [looks at the camera] Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone streets, cragging London buildings, and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings. [closes the book] Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, ""Great Expectations"" [displays the title] And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, [the town is now shown, with Pip walking up the street from a distance] where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents."
4464,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[holding a bunch of flowers] 'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again. [before him are two tombstones. They are of his parents, Phillip and Georgina Pirrip. Pip is in the town graveyard.] Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together. [a wind comes up and begins to howl. Pip takes notice] But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon. [walks off, but there's a fear in him as he walks through the graveyard. He has his hands in his coat pockets. He is snatched up from behind] Wa-a-ah!"
4465,4,14,Ex Convict,"Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!"
4466,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[fearless] Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison? [the surprised man lets him down] Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. [whips out some bolt cutters]"
4467,4,14,Ex Convict,Wha' are you doin' wit' those?
4468,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"I'm an apprentice blacksmith. [snips the arm and leg shackles in two] There you are. [puts the bolt cutters away and whips out some food] And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! [the man takes the sandwich, then walks away]"
4469,4,14,Ex Convict,[stops and turns] Here. W-why are you easy to help me?
4470,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same. [the man turns and walks away] Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. [walks out of the graveyard towards his residence, a rambling one-story shack. The sound of smithing is heard in the background]"
4471,4,14,Mrs Joe,"[sees him enter and grabs him by the scarf] Pip, where 'ave you been?!"
4472,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Waaah! [is whipped towards the opposite wall, which he hits hard, but he recovers instantly] Lovely day, isn't it?"
4473,4,14,Mrs Joe,"What the hell's lovely about it?! [to someone else - a burly man working on some metal] Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicism!"
4474,4,14,Joe Gargery,"I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing. [looks at his project] Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker. [holds it up]"
4475,4,14,Mrs Joe,A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!
4476,4,14,Joe Gargery,"[finishes another item and sets down his hammer] Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange. [shows it off]"
4477,4,14,Mrs Joe,"STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy! [Pip is shown] And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now!"
4478,4,14,Joe Gargery,"[finishing yet another project] Oh, lookie heeah! [holds up a newspaper] I've gone and made a metal newspaper!"
4479,4,14,Mrs Joe,"Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper?"
4480,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!"
4481,4,14,Mrs Joe,Where? [Joe shows her the paper]
4482,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Where?
4483,4,14,Mrs Joe,"""Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..."" TWENTY QUID A DAY??"
4484,4,14,Pip Pirrip,That's a lot of [hops] money-loney.
4485,4,14,Joe Gargery,"You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town. [Mrs. Joe walks away]"
4486,4,14,A British Person (Malcolm McDowell),"Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job. [Pip rings the door bell pulley at Havisham Estate, then a shot of A British Person] and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams."
4487,4,14,Girl,Who are you?! [there's venom in her voice]
4488,4,14,Pip Pirrip,...I've come to answer the want ad.
4489,4,14,Girl,"Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!"
4490,4,14,Pip Pirrip,[jarred] What??
4491,4,14,Girl,"[opens the gate and lets him in] This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge! [leads him to the entrance and through the front doors, then to their left] This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis. [leads him up the grand stairway] Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit! [the place suffers from neglect, as spiderwebs hang from the chandeliers and walls around the mansion. The windows are covered over with paper. The girl leads Pip down the hall upstairs] In here."
4492,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Eho. After you, miss."
4493,4,14,Girl,"I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!"
4494,4,14,Ms Havisham,[an elderly lady still in wedding veil] Who is that?
4495,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am."
4496,4,14,Ms Havisham,[beckons] Come closer. Look at me. [Pip closes the door and approaches] Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
4497,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days."
4498,4,14,Ms Havisham,"I sometimes have sick fancies. [puts her hands together] And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play."
4499,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[not sure what she wants] Um. [begins to dance. The girl enters, glances at him, then continues to Ms. Havisham]"
4500,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Estella, play with this boy."
4501,4,14,Estella Havisham,[the blonde girl] With HIM? [Pip dances faster] But he's just a commoner!
4502,4,14,Ms Havisham,"[leans over and whispers] But, you can break his heart."
4503,4,14,Estella Havisham,"...Alright, boy, let us play."
4504,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Righty-o. What are we going to play?
4505,4,14,Estella Havisham,"[walks over to a wood pile, gets a log, and brings it with her] We're going to play a little game called, ""Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."""
4506,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[hops excitedly] Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time! [gladly bows to Estella] Who will go first? [Estella is taken aback by this gesture, as is Ms. Havisham]"
4507,4,14,Estella Havisham,"[frustrated] Oh, you stupid pathetic boy! [drops the log and rushes out of the room unnerved. Pip looks up quizzically]"
4508,4,14,Ms Havisham,What do you think of her?
4509,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Well, uh... I think she's very pretty."
4510,4,14,Ms Havisham,Hm-m-m. What else?
4511,4,14,Pip Pirrip,I think she's rather insulting.
4512,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall ""play"" some more. [Pip turns and exits the room.]"
4513,4,14,A British Person (Malcolm McDowell),"[Off-screen] That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind."
4514,4,14,Dream Estella,"Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!"
4515,4,14,A British Person (Malcolm McDowell),"Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew."
4516,4,14,Pip Pirrip,[stands up straight] Don't you wanna play anymore?
4517,4,14,Estella Havisham,"[tosses her log away] Boy, do you still think I'm pretty? [draws near]"
4518,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Oho. Well, yes, miss."
4519,4,14,Estella Havisham,"And, do you still think I'm insulting?"
4520,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, um, not so much as before. [slapped by Estella] Ow!"
4521,4,14,Estella Havisham,"I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!"
4522,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[exasperated. puts hands in coat pockets] Oh, dear."
4523,4,14,Estella Havisham,"You may kiss me if you like. [offers her cheek. He looks, then kisses her on the cheek. She softens] Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden. [she leads him past a fountain in which a boy is splashing about merrily]"
4524,4,14,A Boy,"Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain! [points at Pip] You there, the prowling little boy! I bet you can't jump on my back! [shows Pip his back] Go on, then. Try and jump on my back!"
4525,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Who is that?
4526,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?"
4527,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Oh I... rather thought I was.
4528,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden. [takes his hand and leads him onward]"
4529,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces."
4530,4,14,A British Person (Malcolm McDowell),"Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day. [excitedly] Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely?? [the cheer vanishes] But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice."
4531,4,14,Joe Gargery,"[hammering away] And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it. [holds up some steel dice and hands them to Pip.] Your very own metal fuzzy dice."
4532,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[takes the dice] Yes. I see. [walks to a chair and sits in it] Hoh, lovely."
4533,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?"
4534,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Joe, do you know anything about girls?"
4535,4,14,Joe Gargery,[resumes hammering] Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.
4536,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[blank look then] But, do you know anything about them? About how they work."
4537,4,14,Joe Gargery,"[pauses and looks back at Pip] Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'. [begins to hammer more vigorously]"
4538,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
4539,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip. [a knock is heard at the door] Who could that be? [goes to answer the door. A lawyer, with cane and tall hat, addresses him]"
4540,4,14,Lawyer,"Joe, the blacksmith?"
4541,4,14,Joe Gargery,The same.
4542,4,14,Lawyer,I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.
4543,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"I'm Pip, sir."
4544,4,14,Lawyer,"Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice. [walks over to Pip]"
4545,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir."
4546,4,14,Lawyer,I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires. [Joe approaches] Do you still object?
4547,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-"
4548,4,14,Lawyer,He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.
4549,4,14,Joe Gargery,That's great news! [Pip grins]
4550,4,14,Lawyer,"There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous."
4551,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!
4552,4,14,Lawyer,"OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?"
4553,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Yes sir.
4554,4,14,Lawyer,"Then you will go to London in a week's time. [deposits some money on the table] Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned."
4555,4,14,Joe Gargery,"I am, sir."
4556,4,14,Lawyer,"Then I should take my leave. [heads for the door] Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip. [exits]"
4557,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Good-bye, sir."
4558,4,14,Joe Gargery,[picks Pip up] Pip! [close-up on a grinning Pip] A young gentleman! Of great expectations!
4559,4,14,Lawyer,"You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?"
4560,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"None, sir."
4561,4,14,Lawyer,"I should think not. [taps his cane on the ground twice] On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow."
4562,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. [goes to the residence and opens the front door, then enters]"
4563,4,14,A Boy,Mr. Pip? [it's the same one seen in the fountain earlier]
4564,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Mr. Pocket?
4565,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Pray, come in! [drags him in.]"
4566,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
4567,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth. [leads Pip to the bedrooms] This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom. [displays the next room over]"
4568,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"My, how lovely."
4569,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them! [takes the bags to Pip's room] I'm quite ashamed!"
4570,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Oh it's... quite alright. [remembers] Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!"
4571,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!"
4572,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed."
4573,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!"
4574,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Well, what do you mean?"
4575,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come! [Pip removes his hat and they walk over to the table at one corner of the sitting room, by the windows. A cooked bird and two glasses wait for them] Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham."
4576,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?"
4577,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat. [Pip eats his food with his knife] And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth."
4578,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[with knife by lips] Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry! [lowers the knife]"
4579,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure. [looks at Pip] Anyway, Ms. Havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip [who has placed his napkin in his glass], to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler."
4580,4,14,Pip Pirrip,[quickly retracts it] Sorry! Sorry!
4581,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure. [resumes] So this man pursued Ms. Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom. [Pip farts] And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!"
4582,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Oh. Excuse me.
4583,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding."
4584,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house."
4585,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table."
4586,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Terribly sorry, Pocket."
4587,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure!"
4588,4,14,A British Person (Malcolm McDowell),"And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella."
4589,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[enters the dining room] Good evening, Ms. Havisham. [she hasn't moved from her spot]"
4590,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Come closer, Pip. [he doffs his hat and approaches] My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?"
4591,4,14,Pip Pirrip,[cheerfully] Thanks to you.
4592,4,14,Ms Havisham,Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well. [Pip walks to Ms. Havisham's side] She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her? [shows him a portrait]
4593,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. [she is shown wearing a beautiful pink dress and a makeover]"
4594,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?"
4595,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[pensive] I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day."
4596,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it."
4597,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Righto.
4598,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved."
4599,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Yes, but... where will I find her?"
4600,4,14,Ms Havisham,There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
4601,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything! [heads for the door] I'm the happiest boy in the land!"
4602,4,14,Ms Havisham,"And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper. [whispers] Lover her."
4603,4,14,A British Person (Malcolm McDowell),"Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world."
4604,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Hello, Estella."
4605,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Pip. [impressed] My goodness, how you've changed!"
4606,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I? [signals an invitation to dance]
4607,4,14,Estella Havisham,I suppose. [a waltz starts and all couples begin to dance.] So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?
4608,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Well, I was sent to be schooled in London."
4609,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?"
4610,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all."
4611,4,14,Estella Havisham,Naturally. [overview of the Grand Ballroom]
4612,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[walks off to one side with Estella] It is wonderful to see you again, Estella."
4613,4,14,Estella Havisham,Is it? Why? [they resume dancing]
4614,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Because I believe I'm in love with you.
4615,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Pip, you must know that I have no heart."
4616,4,14,Pip Pirrip,[confidently] I think you do.
4617,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but [sighs] you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment."
4618,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind."
4619,4,14,Older Boy,"[walks up to the kids] Hey, Estella, let's get out of here."
4620,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Alright, Steve. Just one moment. [Steve walks off]"
4621,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Who...? Who is that?
4622,4,14,Estella Havisham,That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
4623,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?"
4624,4,14,Estella Havisham,I should. He's my boyfriend.
4625,4,14,Pip Pirrip,[scared] Boyfriend??
4626,4,14,Estella Havisham,"What's the matter, Pip?!"
4627,4,14,Pip Pirrip,I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
4628,4,14,Estella Havisham,"It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip. [Steve waits for her off to the side] He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very [pause] I'm [pause] leaving. [walks off with Steve.]"
4629,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- [a surprised look comes over his face]
4630,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip. [Estella and Steve are already there, sitting behind a small table at her side, next to each other, sharing a float between them]"
4631,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Ms. Havisham! But um...
4632,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip? [Steve reaches for Estella's right hand with his left] Look at the way he holds her hand."
4633,4,14,Pip Pirrip,But I don't understand. [doffs his hat] You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
4634,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Things aren't always as they seem, Pip. [Pip looks defeated] Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?"
4635,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[close-up] ...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt."
4636,4,14,Ms Havisham,Yes. Tell me about the pain. [Estella looks distressed] Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
4637,4,14,Pip Pirrip,It's... a-as if...[winces] sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss [winces] squeezing it very tightly.
4638,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe."
4639,4,14,Steve,"Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?"
4640,4,14,Ms Havisham,[turns her head to look at Steve] Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.
4641,4,14,Pip Pirrip,But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
4642,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device. [Pip looks at her in horror] You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation."
4643,4,14,Steve,What the hell??
4644,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform. [Estella draws away from Steve]"
4645,4,14,Steve,"[holds on to Estella's left arm] Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me! [Ms. Havisham flips opens a panel on the right arm of her chair and presses a red button. A contraption appears and wraps itself around Steve] What the?! [a cathode at the top of the head completes the contraption]"
4646,4,14,Ms Havisham,"And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you! [presses the button again and robot monkeys descend from the ceiling and clamor around Pip. He is startled and rushes out the door, down the stairs, out the front door, and out the front gates, only to stop and faint outside the gates]"
4647,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Pip? Pip, old chap? [appears blurry to Pip.]"
4648,4,14,Pip Pirrip,[rises a bit] Joe?
4649,4,14,Joe Gargery,That's right. You're safe and warm now.
4650,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"[stands next to Joe] Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours."
4651,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[sits up and says urgently] Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house! [laments] Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?"
4652,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you. [the convict Pip had set free earlier returns, but he's nicely dressed now, in three-piece suit and gloves]"
4653,4,14,Ex Convict,"Allo, Pip. You remember me? [Pip cowers and remembers...]"
4654,4,14,Ex Convict,[threatening him back at the graveyard when they first met] I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse!
4655,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago."
4656,4,14,Ex Convict,"Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire."
4657,4,14,Joe Gargery,"'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!"
4658,4,14,Pip Pirrip,You? But why?
4659,4,14,Ex Convict,Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.
4660,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. [Pocket approaches]"
4661,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex."
4662,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone."
4663,4,14,Herbert Pocket,Righto. Pip. Righto.
4664,4,14,Pip Pirrip,And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
4665,4,14,Joe Gargery,"What's that, Pip."
4666,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!"
4667,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Yeah! [Pocket raises his hands, Joe and the convict pump their fists]"
4668,4,14,A British Person (Malcolm McDowell),"And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!"
4669,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?"
4670,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Yes, Mother. [Ms. Havisham straps herself into her seat, and the main door fly open. In come Joe and Pocket with swords, the ex-convict with a pistol, and Pip with a filled bag]"
4671,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch."
4672,4,14,Estella Havisham,Pip? [Ms. Havisham presses the red button once again.and her chair floats forward]
4673,4,14,Joe Gargery,"[wielding his sward] Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!"
4674,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin."
4675,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Dear God, Pip, look! [points to a long contraption containing men and boys hanging upside down from their ankles. Bowls wait underneath them to receive their tears.]"
4676,4,14,Steve,"[second from left] Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!"
4677,4,14,Boy,[third from right] So am I.
4678,4,14,Man,[left of center] And me.
4679,4,14,Man In Middle,We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.
4680,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Yes. Cry away, males. [returns to her original position] Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete."
4681,4,14,Pip Pirrip,You won't get away with this!
4682,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Won't I? [presses the red button, and robot monkeys again descend from the ceiling and come at the guests. Joe and the others use their weapons to fend off the attacks.] Let the transformation begin. [the cables have been activated]"
4683,4,14,Joe Gargery,"[disables a robot monkey by slicing its leg off] Pip, she started the device! [the men on the torture device bawl]"
4684,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[approaches among the robot monkey corpses] Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!"
4685,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Righto, Pip. [they do their tasks]"
4686,4,14,Ms Havisham,[activates the device full throttle] It begins.
4687,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[approaches Estella] Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this."
4688,4,14,Estella Havisham,"It is... what I was raised for. [a robot monkey jumps at the ex-convict, and the ex-convict shoots at it and kills it off]"
4689,4,14,Robot Monkey,AAAAAAA!!!
4690,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid."
4691,4,14,Man,"How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!"
4692,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Yes, but just think about... panda bears! [the hanging males just look at him] Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are. [grabs his own nose] What silly little noses they have!"
4693,4,14,Man,[third from left] Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.
4694,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"[quickly waves the thought away with both hands] Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive. [the males just look at him]"
4695,4,14,Ms Havisham,...Yes...
4696,4,14,Ex Convict,"[quickly approaches] Get out of that chair, you old cow! [points a gun at her, and she spits a green fluid into his face. A few moments later he turns away and his face has been eaten away by the fluid, revealing bones and teeth.. He babbles on a bit, then drops down dead.]"
4697,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[still before Estella] Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart."
4698,4,14,Estella Havisham,"I told you, Pip. I have no heart."
4699,4,14,Pip Pirrip,But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all! [reaches into his bag. Joe is still fending off the robot monkeys. Pip pulls out a bunny] Look at this adorable little bunny.
4700,4,14,Estella Havisham,[flatly] Oh my. 'E's very cute.
4701,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck. [she reaches out to grab it, then breaks its neck with nary a flinch] ...Oh. But look at this bunny. [pulls out another bunny from the bag and presents it to her] There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies. [she reaches out to grab it, then breaks its neck. Pip gets worried] ...Right."
4702,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"[still diverting the guys on the rack] Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors."
4703,4,14,Man,[left of center] My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.
4704,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about... [thinks a bit]"
4705,4,14,Man In Middle,Ice-skating!
4706,4,14,Herbert Pocket,Oh what fun ice-skating is! [moves around as if ice-skating] Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.
4707,4,14,Joe Gargery,[now covered in robot monkeys] Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!
4708,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to- [crrrack. Estella has killed another bunny] Ten baby bunnies!
4709,4,14,Joe Gargery,[still fighting the robot monkeys] ...There's too many of them! [the males on the rack begin to cry]
4710,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Please, sirs, you must not cry!"
4711,4,14,Man,"[left of center] We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears! [lights under the rack flick on one by one, and the sequence leads to a computer, and then to the Genesis device]"
4712,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Philip, it's too late!!"
4713,4,14,Pip Pirrip,Twenty-six baby bunnies
4714,4,14,Estella Havisham,I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
4715,4,14,Pip Pirrip,What?
4716,4,14,Estella Havisham,I don't want to kill any more of them.
4717,4,14,Pip Pirrip,There! You see?! You do have a heart!
4718,4,14,Estella Havisham,You think so? Let me see it [referring to the bunny] Maybe I can kill it.
4719,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"[quickly hides the bunny] No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! [she looks back at him]"
4720,4,14,Ms Havisham,"Yessss! [electricity crackles and then moves over to Estella's part of the Genesis device. Estella looks up at Ms. Havisham, then stretches her hand out to Pip. Pip takes her hand and quickly takes her away from the device. Ms. Havisham looks over] Noooo! [her chair bursts into flames and she screams horribly, twisting here and there]"
4721,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Ooooo, top smart, Pip! [Ms. Havisham's body quickly turns to ashes]"
4722,4,14,Joe Gargery,"You did it, Pip! [the last of the robot monkeys falls away]"
4723,4,14,Joe Gargery,"Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?"
4724,4,14,Estella Havisham,Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
4725,4,14,Pip Pirrip,"You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!"
4726,4,14,Estella Havisham,"Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love! [she and Pip embrace]"
4727,4,14,Herbert Pocket,"Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out. [Pip and Estella break the embrace] Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?"
4728,4,14,A British person,"And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B. [closes the book and rests it on his laps] So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. We hope you now have a deeper appreciation for Pip, and indeed, [holds up the book] all masterpieces of literature like this one. [rests it again] Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night."
4729,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism."
4730,4,15,Class,Yeah! [There are new seating arrangements to note: Wendy now sits to Stan's left. Timmy sits in the back of the class. Pip sits behind Kenny. Two students not seen before join the class]
4731,4,15,Bebe Stevens,Woohoo.
4732,4,15,New Kid,Woohoo.
4733,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"[walks off] Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee. [return with a large dolly stacked with manatee corpses. Stan and Kyle glance at each other] Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea."
4734,4,15,Wendy Testaburger,"Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?"
4735,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them. [pushes the dolly towards the class and hands the manatees out] Now, we don't have quite enough [one goes to Butters] manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. [Stan and Annie get manatees]"
4736,4,15,Butters Stotch,Hey! Ours is still alive!
4737,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"[walks up and looks] Oh, hold on. [walks away. The manatee raises its head. Ms. Choksondik returns with a brick and brings it down hard on the manatee's head twice, killing it and exposing its brain. Butters is stunned. Ms. Choksondik returns to the front of the class] Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen."
4738,4,15,Stan Marsh,"[holding his knife] I can't do it, dude."
4739,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, don't be such a baby! [takes the knife, blinks, then offers it to Kenny] You do it, Kenny."
4740,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh uh!)
4741,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!"
4742,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(FIVE BUCKS???) [grabs the knife and starts cutting away]
4743,4,15,Stan Marsh,Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
4744,4,15,Phillip,"Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso."
4745,4,15,Terrance,I don't see anything.
4746,4,15,Phillip,Look closer. [Terrance looks closer] Closer. [Terrance bends down further. Phillip holds Terrance's head down] Hunh-nh.
4747,4,15,Terrance,"I still don't see anything, Phillip."
4748,4,15,Phillip,Waitwait. Hunh.
4749,4,15,Eric Cartman,"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?"
4750,4,15,Phillip,"[grunts softly] Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here. [grunts long, farts, and cackles. The camera pulls back to reveal Terrance standing on a stool. Phillip looks to see Terrance ready to fart on him. Terrance lets loose...] Ah! [...and Phillip is blown into a nearby wall, then falls on his side] Af!"
4751,4,15,Terrance,AAHahahahahahaaa!
4752,4,15,Eric Cartman,Whoa! That totally surprised me! [his mom looks at him] I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
4753,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Eh yes, sweetie."
4754,4,15,Eric Cartman,[sweetly] Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? [grins]
4755,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself? [his grin vanishes] Mommy's [looks away] expecting [looks back] some company."
4756,4,15,Eric Cartman,"God, I have to everything around here!"
4757,4,15,Eric Cartman,"I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.] What the hell's going on?"
4758,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a ""talk"" with you."
4759,4,15,Mr Mackey,"Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?"
4760,4,15,Eric Cartman,[incredulous] What?!
4761,4,15,Dr Doctor,We believe that you might have a problem.
4762,4,15,Eric Cartman,You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
4763,4,15,Mr Garrison,"It's called intervention, Eric."
4764,4,15,Liane Cartman,Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
4765,4,15,Eric Cartman,Fat camp?
4766,4,15,Dr Doctor,"Yes, fat camp."
4767,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this, [grabs his creation and drops the plate on the floor] but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!"
4768,4,15,Mr Mackey,"Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you."
4769,4,15,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you."
4770,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[pleading] Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!"
4771,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. [Cartman is stunned. A piece of Pop Toasties falls on the floor]"
4772,4,15,Ms Choksondik,And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-
4773,4,15,Principal Victoria,"[opens the door and peeks in] Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?"
4774,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"[puts down the pointer and goes towards the door] Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back. [opens the door and exits.]"
4775,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"[working on his manatee] Aw, dude, check this out. [pulls out the spleen with some scissors]"
4776,4,15,Stan Marsh,[off-screen] That's so gross.
4777,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?"
4778,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(I'm not eatin' that!)
4779,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
4780,4,15,Stan Marsh,I'll throw in five.
4781,4,15,Principal Victoria,And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
4782,4,15,Ms Choksondik,Oh dear.
4783,4,15,Butters Stotch,I'll throw in a dollar!
4784,4,15,Bebe Stevens,I've got three.
4785,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!"
4786,4,15,Stan Marsh,"[off-screen, enticing] forty-one bucks. [Kenny jumps up and starts eating it. The others groan and moan] Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!"
4787,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"[returns to the front of the class] Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. [the kids blink with surprise]"
4788,4,15,Liane Cartman,"...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want. [Cartman has been looking away all this time. She looks at him] Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. [the station wagon pulls up to the Hopeful Hills REGISTRATION building]"
4789,4,15,Male Counselor,Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.
4790,4,15,Liane Cartman,Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
4791,4,15,Male Counselor,"Oh, we'll change that. [bends down next to the passenger window] Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?"
4792,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?"
4793,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented. [stands up and Cartman exits the car] I'll take care of him from here, ma'am."
4794,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Oh. [bows and opens her arms to hug Cartman] Well, goodbye, sweetie."
4795,4,15,Eric Cartman,[darkly] Don't touch me! [moves away a bit]
4796,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!"
4797,4,15,Brunette,[to Cartman's right] Have you got any candy?
4798,4,15,Eric Cartman,No.
4799,4,15,Taller Boy,[to Cartman's left] My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.
4800,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"[walks up to the group enthusiastically] Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is [jumps] fun, right gang?"
4801,4,15,Taller Boy,Right.
4802,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Wait a second. [holds his right hand to his ear] Do you kids hear something? [drops his hand] I could've swore that-
4803,4,15,Pink Monster,Raaarrrr!!! [a woman in costume]
4804,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!"
4805,4,15,Pink Monster,I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow! [starts hopping around]
4806,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise! [holds up an EXERCISE paddle, strikes the monster on the head with it, and tosses it away] And... Proper Diet. [does the same with a PROPER DIET paddle]"
4807,4,15,Pink Monster,Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me. [falls over on her side]
4808,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?"
4809,4,15,Taller Boy,Yeah! [Cartman glares at him]
4810,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan, [she pops out of the costume] who's another weight counselor! [she jumps out in front of the costume and exults]"
4811,4,15,Taller Boy,Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
4812,4,15,Eric Cartman,[miffed] Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
4813,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up with Butters] What's the matter?
4814,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. [Clyde and Token come in from the right, Wendy and Bebe come in from the left. Stan comforts Kenny.]"
4815,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. [Stan jumps back as Kenny starts vomiting the spleen up. Stan and Kyle watch in shock]
4816,4,15,Kids,Eewww.
4817,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Well, at least you got it out of your system."
4818,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen! [Butters looks at him] How much, Kenny?"
4819,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(WHAT?!)
4820,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
4821,4,15,Butters Stotch,Huh-I'm in for five!
4822,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Oh, you guys!"
4823,4,15,Clyde Donovan,I've got three.
4824,4,15,Token Black,Six!
4825,4,15,Butters Stotch,"Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. [Kenny takes it and opens it up, then bends to scoop the vomit up into the thermos]"
4826,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"That's 19 bucks, Kenny! [more kids gather]"
4827,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(Ungh.) [goes ahead and eats his vomit]
4828,4,15,Kids around Kenny,AAAAA!
4829,4,15,Kids around Timmy,Waugh.
4830,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Kick ass, dude!"
4831,4,15,Stan Marsh,"You know, dude, there might be something to this."
4832,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
4833,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Doing great kids! Come on! [they resume jogging and the fat kids lumber to the top of the hill panting behind them. Cartman stops and droops]
4834,4,15,Eric Cartman,[resumes jogging] This... is... bullcrap!
4835,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?"
4836,4,15,Eric Cartman,[in withdrawal] I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
4837,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"[cheerfully arrives with a loaded plate] I hope you all left room for dessert. Soybean pudding for everybody! [serves a plate of the stuff to everyone there, starting with Cartman's table]"
4838,4,15,Brunet Boy,[to Cartman's left] Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
4839,4,15,Eric Cartman,[shoves his plate to the boy] Take it! I can't eat this crap!
4840,4,15,Blonde Girl,[to Cartman's right] Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.
4841,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[to the girl] Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass."
4842,4,15,Brunet Boy,I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
4843,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!"
4844,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. [sees the entrance and races for it. He exits and races through the meadow until he reaches a road.] We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? [an ice cream truck approaches him] An ice cream truck! Hey wait! [races up to the truck. The driver exits the cab] Boy, am I glad to see you!"
4845,4,15,Driver,Can I interest you in some ice cream?
4846,4,15,Eric Cartman,"You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!"
4847,4,15,Driver,"[goes to the back of the truck, opens the doors, and pulls out one pop.] Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? [points to the inside of the truck. Cartman looks]"
4848,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Hunh? [is lifted up] Uuh! [and tossed into the truck. The doors are closed behind him, and he looks up. Before him sit four other kids who have tried to escape]"
4849,4,15,Boy 1,"[on bench at left]They tricked us again, huh?"
4850,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[stands up] Aw, God-damnit! [turns] LET ME OUT OF HMYA! [pounds on the back doors]"
4851,4,15,Driver,"Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. [drives into camp]"
4852,4,15,Boy 1,"They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us."
4853,4,15,Taller Boy,Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy. [Rick and Susan pop into the campers' cabin.]
4854,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Hey kids!
4855,4,15,Sussan,Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.
4856,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave."
4857,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,[bends forward sweetly a bit and cocks her head to the left] There is no escape.
4858,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT"
4859,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[pissed off] Aw, damnit!"
4860,4,15,Gerald,That's what being young is all about.
4861,4,15,Mr Garrison,[at the same time] But that's not the question.
4862,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Thanks for coming, everybody."
4863,4,15,Mr Mackey,"Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp?"
4864,4,15,Stan Marsh,We knew he wouldn't make it.
4865,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. [steps to one side as Cartman enters]"
4866,4,15,New Cartman,"Hey, dudes!"
4867,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! [the others look stunned]
4868,4,15,Stan Marsh,I don't believe it.
4869,4,15,Liane Cartman,Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. [everyone gathers round Cartman]
4870,4,15,Mr Mackey,"Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!"
4871,4,15,Principal Victoria,Congratulations. How do you feel?
4872,4,15,New Cartman,I feel awesome!
4873,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
4874,4,15,New Cartman,"You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm [leans a bit to eye Kyle's belly] a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy! [stands erect] Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle."
4875,4,15,Liane Cartman,I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
4876,4,15,Eric Cartman,Memememeee! [the group heads for the kitchen while Stan and Kyle stay behind]
4877,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
4878,4,15,Stan Marsh,Did you like the old one?
4879,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Good point.
4880,4,15,Announcer,"And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access."
4881,4,15,Jesus,"[with the new Cartman] Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength."
4882,4,15,New Cartman,"No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works."
4883,4,15,Jesus,"A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman! [the studio audience applauds] Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? [Kenny enters with Stan, Kyle, and a dog. Music begins as a spotlight falls on Kenny. The dog turns his ass to Kenny and craps. A musical riff plays as Kenny picks the crap up and the audience groans with disgust. Some of them cover their eyes. Kenny lifts the crap dramatically into the air a wailing female joins the music. Another riff plays as Kenny swallows the crap. A small pedestal appears under him and pushes him up and around. The audience groans some more, Kenny finishes off the crap, and the audience beings to cheer. The new Cartman is pissed]"
4884,4,15,New Cartman,"God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!"
4885,4,15,Jesus,"[hesitant] Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny."
4886,4,15,Kenny McCormick,[gracious] (Sure!)
4887,4,15,Man 1,Do it again!
4888,4,15,Man 2,Do it again!
4889,4,15,Man 3,Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!
4890,4,15,New Cartman,This is ridiculous! [picks at his eye]
4891,4,15,Jesus,"So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?"
4892,4,15,Stan Marsh,"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing."
4893,4,15,Jesus,"I can't say I approve of this, my children."
4894,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,[he and Stan look at Jesus for a moment] Huh? Why not?
4895,4,15,Jesus,Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
4896,4,15,Man 4,I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.
4897,4,15,Man 5,Yeah!
4898,4,15,Man 6,Yeah! Go for it!
4899,4,15,Stan Marsh,[to Kyle] What's a prostitute?
4900,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
4901,4,15,Chef,"[behind the sneeze guard, as usual] Hello there, children!"
4902,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Chef:"
4903,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Chef:"
4904,4,15,Kenny McCormick,"Hey, Chef:"
4905,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
4906,4,15,Chef,"[ponders, then displeased] Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! ""Chef, what's the clitoris?"" ""What's a lesbian, Chef?"" ""How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?"" [the boys blink. Stan and Kyle look at each other] For once, can't you just come in here and say, ""Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?""!"
4907,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"
4908,4,15,Chef,[pleased] It sure is! Thank you.
4909,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
4910,4,15,Chef,Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
4911,4,15,New Cartman,[joins the other boys] Lunchtime! I'm starved!
4912,4,15,Chef,Oh my God. Eric?
4913,4,15,New Cartman,That's me.
4914,4,15,Stan Marsh,Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
4915,4,15,Chef,Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
4916,4,15,Stan Marsh,Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
4917,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. Am I?)
4918,4,15,Chef,"Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute."
4919,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
4920,4,15,Chef,"Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services."
4921,4,15,Stan Marsh,Like what?
4922,4,15,Chef,Like keeping you company. Understand?
4923,4,15,Stan Marsh,No.
4924,4,15,Chef,"You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. [begins singing]
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
[the new Cartman looks at the other boys as he starts sneaking away. They don't notice him. Other kids, Annie, Token, Clyde, Butters, and Bebe, enter the kitchen]
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
[Principal Victoria arrives and listens]
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor."
4925,4,15,James Taylor,"[enters next to Chef playing a guitar]
A prostitute is like any other woman
They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well.
[the new Cartman goes into the supply room and starts packing donuts into his backpack]"
4926,4,15,Chef,And that's why I say-
4927,4,15,Chef and James Taylor,Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-
4928,4,15,Chef,"Oohhhh [they stop when they see Principal Victoria, who has crossed her arms in anger] ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here! [James leaves, but Principal Victoria is not satisfied.] ...These children tricked me!"
4929,4,15,New Cartman,"[a shadow falls on him] Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy."
4930,4,15,Eric Cartman,Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
4931,4,15,New Cartman,Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
4932,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!"
4933,4,15,New Cartman,Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
4934,4,15,Eric Cartman,What?!
4935,4,15,New Cartman,"I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!"
4936,4,15,Eric Cartman,Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
4937,4,15,New Cartman,Twenty.
4938,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[soft gasp] Suck my balls, 20!"
4939,4,15,New Cartman,Fine! Then I shall bid you good day! [turns aside to get his bike]
4940,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! [the new Cartman looks trapped]"
4941,4,15,Student 1,[bursts through the door] You guys! You have to check this tape out!
4942,4,15,Student 2,"[on the sofa] Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are tomorrow."
4943,4,15,Student 1,"No, dude, check this out! It's a video: this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff. [pops the video into the VCR and turns on the TV] Check it out! He jumped into a Porto-Potty at a construction site and stayed there for four days! [the screen shows Kenny standing in a pool of poo under the toilet and looking at the camera]"
4944,4,15,Other Students,"Whoa! [the screen shows a construction worker heading for the Porto-Potty. He enters and sits on the toilet, and a long log of poo descends from his nether regions]"
4945,4,15,Kenny McCormick,[the poo lands square on his face] (Ow.)
4946,4,15,Student 1,"Oh, gro-hoss"
4947,4,15,Student 3,Sick!
4948,4,15,Student 2,That's awesome! [rushes out to the hall and hollers] Hey guys! Check this out!
4949,4,15,Announcer,"[graphics come up animated, with letters exploding behind the show's logo] Get ready for the Krrrrrrazy Kenny Show! [four spotlights roam the stage] And now here's your host, the kid who will do anything to himself for money, Krrrra—a--a-a-azy Kenny! [Kenny appears and goes to the center of the stage, The spotlights converge on him as music reaches climax] Kenny, through the past weeks we've seen you eat mice, pretend to kill newborn babies to shock their mothers and ...wash your hair with battery acid. The question in all our minds is,  who-haht are you gonna do next? [the audience cheers]"
4950,4,15,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)"
4951,4,15,Announcer,"Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather!"
4952,4,15,Man 1,Oho! Yeah!
4953,4,15,Man 2,Woohoo!
4954,4,15,Audience,Awww! Awgh!
4955,4,15,Stan Marsh,Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
4956,4,15,New Cartman,"This is so juvenile. [bites a licorice stick. He has a box of donuts on his lap, and he and Kyle have licorice sticks]"
4957,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? [takes a donut]"
4958,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?"
4959,4,15,New Cartman,"Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?"
4960,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. [opens the door, exits, and closes the door]"
4961,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"[waiting] All beddy-byes for the night, are they?"
4962,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight."
4963,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it!
4964,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,They'll do it.
4965,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"They'll do it!! [the counselors leave. Inside the cabin Cartman looks out the window, watching them leave]"
4966,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Alright, they're gone! [walks to his bed and pulls out a suitcase from underneath] The Cartman store is open! [the other kids leave their bunks and head for Cartman]"
4967,4,15,Blonde Girl,"[first in line, hands him some money] Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please."
4968,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[quickly as he hands the goods over] Two donuts and a pack of licorice. [she walks away,and a big, tall boy is next] Well, Tony, the usual? [Tony, with squinty eyes, blinks and Cartman gives him the usual. Tony walks away. Another boy walks up, crying] Why are you crying, Chad?"
4969,4,15,Chad,"[sobbing] 'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this. [sobs some more. Cartman moves away a bit] All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself. [breaks down]"
4970,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[comforts Chad] Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend."
4971,4,15,Chad,"[wipes away his tears] I'd, I do?"
4972,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Yes. [dangles a chocolate in front of him] A chocolate friend. [Chad begins to howl] Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are. [opens the wrapper to expose the aroma and tempts him] Look at how yummy and sweet he is. [Chad, still sobbing, takes the candy bar and starts eating. Cartman bides his time] ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars. [Chad hands him the money and finishes the candy bar. Cartman just watches] ...There you go."
4973,4,15,Announcer,"This week on Pay Per View [a yellow starburst appears with ""PAY PER VIEW"" on it, then another starburst with Kenny standing behind Ms. Crabtree], Krazy Kenny will crawl up into a woman's uterus and [a shot of Kenny inside the uterus] stay there for six hours. Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime event. Order now!"
4974,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,"Alright, so we're back talkin' to three competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny Knoxville from MTV's Jackass and Krazy Kenny."
4975,4,15,Tom Green,"Hey, Howard."
4976,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,"Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hours."
4977,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,[stammering] Wow!
4978,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,"Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now."
4979,4,15,Tom Green,I'm in.
4980,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,Me too.
4981,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(And me!)
4982,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,Oh.
4983,4,15,Tom Green,Fine! I'll do it for 40!
4984,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,30.
4985,4,15,Tom Green,[points at Johnny] 20!
4986,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(...Ten bucks!)
4987,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,"Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks."
4988,4,15,Tom Green,Damnit. I'm out.
4989,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,Me too. I guess he is the biggest whore.
4990,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,"Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?"
4991,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,And we're gonna reach for the sky... [has arms high above his head]
4992,4,15,Campers,[follow through] Woo-aagh.
4993,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,And down to the ground. [touches the ground with his fingertips]
4994,4,15,Campers,[follow through] Woo-ugh.
4995,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,And up to the sky... [arms high above his head]
4996,4,15,Campers,[follow through] Woo-aagh. [Cartman and the camper to his right perform a quick transaction - Cartman hands him a pastry for a few bucks.]
4997,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,And down to the ground. [touches the ground with his fingertips]
4998,4,15,Campers,"[follow through] Woo-ugh. [a couple enters the yard with their son, the taller camper Cartman got annoyed with early on. Susan catches up]"
4999,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Please, Mr. Sanders. [Rick rises quickly]"
5000,4,15,Mr Sanders,No! I have had it!
5001,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,What's happening?
5002,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Horace's parents want to take him home.
5003,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Oh! But he's not ready yet.
5004,4,15,Mr Sanders,"Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!"
5005,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,They can lose the weight if they try.
5006,4,15,Mr Sanders,Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner! [a shot of the campers] Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat!
5007,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Please, sir, if you give us one more week,..."
5008,4,15,Mr Sanders,Your time is up!
5009,4,15,Mrs Sanders,"Yeah, your time is up!"
5010,4,15,Mr Sanders,And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time!
5011,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony","But, Dad, I..."
5012,4,15,Mr Sanders,"What?! [Horace looks at Cartman, who look back concerned]"
5013,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony",...Nothin'. [he and his parents turn right and walk away]
5014,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"We're in trouble, Rick."
5015,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?"
5016,4,15,Ms Crabtree,HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
5017,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Six hours.
5018,4,15,Ms Crabtree,"HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!"
5019,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Great.
5020,4,15,Stan Marsh,[enters and runs to the stage] You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
5021,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,For what?
5022,4,15,Stan Marsh,For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
5023,4,15,Butters Stotch,Who-what's a hummer??
5024,4,15,Stan Marsh,I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
5025,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
5026,4,15,Stan Marsh,"I know! [Kyle gets an idea. He and Stan descend the steps to talk to the new Cartman, who stands nearby]"
5027,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"[sits next to the new Cartman. Stan sits by Kyle's other side] He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus."
5028,4,15,New Cartman,"You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame. [Kyle looks at him with suspicious anger]"
5029,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"...Alright, that does it! [rises and backs up a bit] This has been bothering the hell out of me! [reaches for the new Cartman's cap and pulls it off, revealing a puffy head of hair. Stan registers shock] I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!"
5030,4,15,New Cartman,Uh oh.
5031,4,15,Announcer,"Well, we've seen him do just about every disgusting thing in the book, and today live on pay-per-view, Krazy Kenny is going to crawl into a woman's uterus for six hours! [the audience jumps and applauds] Well, Ms. Crabtree, your cervix has been dilated, your womb equipped with oxygen- How do you feel?"
5032,4,15,Ms Crabtree,I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16!
5033,4,15,Audience,"[jumping, cheering] Hooray!"
5034,4,15,Announcer,"Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-"
5035,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great."
5036,4,15,New Kenny,[pulls the hood off his face] No way! I'm not doing this!
5037,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!"
5038,4,15,New Kenny,But this isn't fair!
5039,4,15,Stan Marsh,"[walks up and puts the hood back on the new Kenny] Deal, druggie!"
5040,4,15,New Kenny,(But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!)
5041,4,15,Announcer,"And here he is, Kenny McCormick! [Kenny enters, waves to the audience as it cheers, and walks towards Ms. Crabtree. Kenny parts the little curtains and the audience quiets down. The audience reacts as Kenny climbs into the uterus] We can watch him on the video monitors. How are you doin' in there, Kenny? [four monitors frame the stage prop behind Ms. Crabtree. Above her is a digital timer. Inside the womb, Kenny holds his right thumb up]"
5042,4,15,Mrs McCormick,That's my boy! [Stuart smiles]
5043,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Good-bye, Chad."
5044,4,15,Chad s Dad,"We'll be wanting our refund, naturally."
5045,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Naturally.
5046,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Good-bye, Alice."
5047,4,15,Alice,Good-bye. Thank you.
5048,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Oh, don't thank us. We failed you."
5049,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[off to one side] ...65, 66, 67... [counting the dollars he's collected during his stay]"
5050,4,15,Chad,"[at the back door of the car, turns around] Wait a second! This isn't right! [other campers and their parents stop] It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!"
5051,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[through gritted teeth] Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!"
5052,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony","No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating."
5053,4,15,Other campers,Yeah.
5054,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony",I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more.
5055,4,15,Girl,Me neither.
5056,4,15,Other campers,"Yeah. [newly overjoyed, Rick and Susan grin and look at each other]"
5057,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony","If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat."
5058,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Well, it's alright with me. Parents?"
5059,4,15,Mr Sanders,"Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son? [rubs his son's hair; Horace looks up and grins at him]"
5060,4,15,Eric Cartman,"You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! [grins hopefully]"
5061,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore."
5062,4,15,Campers,Yeah.
5063,4,15,Eric Cartman,What?!
5064,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Bubbye. [turns around and walks into the registration building with Susan. The rest of the campers follow them in.]
5065,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Well, screw you, fatasses! [begins sobbing, and pulls out a donut from his pocket. He eats at it between sobs.]"
5066,4,15,Audience,"Four, three, two, one!"
5067,4,15,Announcer,"He did it! Come on out, Kenny! [nothing happens] You made it six hours, Kenny. Come on out of there. [nothing] Hmmm. Uh, Ms. Crabtree, maybe you could give him a little push. [Ms. Crabtree breathes in and pushes down. The new Kenny comes out of the uterus and slides down the steps of the stage]"
5068,4,15,Audience,OOOOHHHHHH!
5069,4,15,Dr Doctor,He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
5070,4,15,Ms Crabtree,I told you I was a tight virgin flower.
5071,4,15,Stan Marsh,"[pointing] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of."
5072,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
5073,4,15,Announcer,"Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick. [Ms. Crabtree pushes down and another boy, wearing glasses, descends] Who was that?"
5074,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on. Throw the football, Ike."
5075,4,16,Ike Broflovski,[picks up the football] No on dahdo. [the football weighs him down and he sinks into the snow. Kyle rushes forward]
5076,4,16,Stan Marsh,[rushes up with Cartman and Kenny] Dude! [Kyle looks] You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
5077,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Hepatitis B?
5078,4,16,Eric Cartman,"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!"
5079,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
5080,4,16,Stan Marsh,We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
5081,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,[withdraws] Hold on. I'll be right back. [turns and runs into the house]
5082,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?"
5083,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"No, Kyle."
5084,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,But all the guys are going!
5085,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile."
5086,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"But Mom, I-"
5087,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"The answer is no, Kyle!"
5088,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh! [turns right and walks out]
5089,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,My parents said I can't go.
5090,4,16,Stan Marsh,"[blinks at Cartman, who blinks back] Well, of course your parents said you can't go!"
5091,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!"
5092,4,16,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
5093,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks down] Ah. Oh, now I already told them."
5094,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess you're screwed, then. [walks away with the other two]"
5095,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. [turns and runs back into the house. Ike finally throws the football off and looks out from the snow]
5096,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!"
5097,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!"
5098,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,What's Cuba?
5099,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
5100,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?"
5101,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,The whole thing.
5102,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh, geez. [walks away]"
5103,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Dear Mr. Castro: [thinks] I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
5104,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
[Castro sees a drawing of a sad Kyle holding a flower, which fades to a sad Kyle writing his letter]
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
[Kyle finishes a drawing of a sad rainbow coalition atop a world globe]
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
[Castro see a drawing of a sad Kyle inside a small house]
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
[A picture of Kyle replaces his self-portrait on the paper]
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
[Kyle finishes one last drawing of himself, which Castro sees last]
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish."
5105,4,16,Fidel Castro,¡¡Llamen a todos junto!!
5106,4,16,Reporter,"Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter. [A shot of Kyle behind a wooden fence comes up] Now the country is again open to American tourism. [shot of Sheila and Gerald stunned] Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba. [Sheila and Gerald look at each other]"
5107,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,[exults] I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
5108,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,No you can't!
5109,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[wounded, turns] What??"
5110,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it."
5111,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!"
5112,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert."
5113,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,But that's not fair! You lied to me!
5114,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-"
5115,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
5116,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,Because we're your parents!
5117,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Well I wish I didn't have any parents! [walks to the front door, opens it, and exits]"
5118,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle!
5119,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
5120,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it."
5121,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
5122,4,16,Eric Cartman,"[smoothly] Well, you... could make them... go away for a while."
5123,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,How?!
5124,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away."
5125,4,16,Stan Marsh,The police?
5126,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you."
5127,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
5128,4,16,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months."
5129,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,[awed] Wow! Three months without parents!
5130,4,16,Kenny McCormick,"(Wow, that is awesome!)"
5131,4,16,Stan Marsh,But what do the police do to them?
5132,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
5133,4,16,Eric Cartman,"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like, [slight whine] ""my parents molestered me."""
5134,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[straight] ""My parents molestered me."""
5135,4,16,Eric Cartman,"No, but you've gotta cry, like this: [starts a fake sob, rubs his eyes] ""My parents molestered me."" [stops the fake cry] And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say [rolls his eyes as he thinks] ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait, [points] you say it was a bad touch."
5136,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"What's ""bad touch""?"
5137,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch."""
5138,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, molestered, bad touch."
5139,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, And cry. [Kyle lets out a soft cry] Oh, he's ready."
5140,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that."
5141,4,16,Case Worker,"[female] You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right."
5142,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Ugh, please, just listen to me! [Cartman chuckles as Kyle's parents are taken to the back door of a squad car] What about my children? Who will take care of them?"
5143,4,16,Case Worker,"Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother."
5144,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Their grandmother's been dead for three years. [she is put into the back seat, and the door is shut. The window is rolled down] You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your- [the window is raised so her voice can't be heard clearly] mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!"
5145,4,16,Case Worker,[walks up to Kyle] They'll never be able to hurt you again. [picks Kyle up and hugs him]
5146,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Cool, thanks."
5147,4,16,Case Worker,"[drops Kyle and stands up] Alright, folks. Our work here is done. [police cars doors close, police cars zoom away, and everyone else disperses]"
5148,4,16,Stan Kyle,[Cartman grins] Alright! [high-five each other]
5149,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too."
5150,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!"
5151,4,16,Kids,"Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!"
5152,4,16,TV Announcer,The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
5153,4,16,Eric Cartman,"[slides up in front of the others] You guys! Come out here! [walks out the door. The other two follow, leaving Ike alone on the sofa.]"
5154,4,16,Stan Marsh,What's going on?
5155,4,16,Eric Cartman,Notice anything? [before them the town sits empty as the sun sits between two mountains in a red sky.] Watch. [takes a stone and throws it hard. It flies through the air and goes through a first-floor window on a building two blocks away]
5156,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,...Nothing.
5157,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town. [more kids gather] They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested"
5158,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Not one adult left?
5159,4,16,Stan Marsh,[steps forward] ...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
5160,4,16,Woman,"Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are."
5161,4,16,Man,I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?
5162,4,16,Woman,There has to be a town around here somewhere.
5163,4,16,Man,Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
5164,4,16,Woman,"Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. [both of them are suddenly shocked as the engine begins to falter]"
5165,4,16,Man,"What the? [the speedometer goes down to 0 and the car begins to hobble] Oh no. No, no, no, no."
5166,4,16,Woman,What's the matter with it?
5167,4,16,Man,"[worried] I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles."
5168,4,16,Woman,"Oh, look! There's a town up ahead. [the signpost for South Park appears, but ""SMiLEy ToWN"" appears in yellow over it. Underneath the sign, a clown mask appears while four balloons] Smiley Town? That's a strange name."
5169,4,16,Man,"Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles. [they pass the sign.]"
5170,4,16,Woman,Hello? Is anybody here? [so rustling is heard and Butters emerges from the garage in a mechanic's suit]
5171,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?"
5172,4,16,Man,"...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car."
5173,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?"
5174,4,16,Man,...It's... just you here?
5175,4,16,Butters Stotch,"No, uh Craig's here, too."
5176,4,16,Man,"Oh, good."
5177,4,16,Butters Stotch,"But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! [Craig exits the office wearing a space outfit complete with helmet]"
5178,4,16,Craig Tucker,[approaches] What?
5179,4,16,Man,"Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?"
5180,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Huuuhhhh, no."
5181,4,16,Man,How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
5182,4,16,Butters Stotch,Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
5183,4,16,Man,Fine! Can you take us there?
5184,4,16,Craig Tucker,You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
5185,4,16,Woman,Yes.
5186,4,16,Butters Stotch,Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
5187,4,16,Man,Yes.
5188,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, alright then. [to Craig] Uh, show 'em where it is."
5189,4,16,Craig Tucker,"[stops just short of the line] This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line."
5190,4,16,Man,"Well, can you help us find the phone, please?"
5191,4,16,Craig Tucker,Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
5192,4,16,Woman,Why not?!
5193,4,16,Man,"Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games."
5194,4,16,Craig Tucker,Craig.
5195,4,16,Man,What?
5196,4,16,Craig Tucker,"It's Spaceman Craig. [walks away slowly, deliberately, making sci-fi sound effects as he walks. Linda and her husband look at each other baffled. They then walk forward...]"
5197,4,16,Two Small Voices,"[off screen] Carousel. [the couple notices a shadow between two buildings. The shadow moves away quickly, and the couple walks on. More ominous music comes up as the walking resumes walking]"
5198,4,16,More Voices,"Nah nah nanah nah! [a post falls over, scaring Linda into her husband's arms]"
5199,4,16,Man,"Look, there's an elementary school [the school has been renamed Treasure Cove Elementary, and it is extremely trashed] Come on, there might be some teachers inside. [the couple heads for the school, but a toy Mega zips by them]"
5200,4,16,Linda Cotner,"[holds on to her husband]What is that? [the truck turns around and comes back]WAAH [raises a foot to avoid being hit by the truck. The truck goes down the street, then turns around and returns once more, stopping in front of the frightened couple]What do you want from us??"
5201,4,16,Man,"Linda, it's a remote-controlled car. [the truck repositions itself] Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it. [the couple is seen in a little monitor inside the school. The truck does have a camera in it]"
5202,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Mark, I don't like this."
5203,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Relax, Linda, everything's fine. [looks closer at the truck. A little index finger presses on a button named Lemmin Juice. The truck ejects a stream of juice] Ow. [squirt] Ow. [rubs his eyes]"
5204,4,16,Linda Cotner,[panicking] What is it?! Acid?!
5205,4,16,Mark Cotner,"No, uh, it's lemon juice."
5206,4,16,Linda Cotner,Oh God! Are you blind?!
5207,4,16,Mark Cotner,"No, it just really, really, really hurts!"
5208,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Mark? Mark, look. [Mark rubs his eyes, then blinks them to focus. Before him is a line of kindergartners. The two sides stare at each other, then a girl steps forward] Well, hello. What's your name? [the girl just looks back at her] What- what do you want?"
5209,4,16,Jenny,We wanna play.
5210,4,16,Linda Cotner,"[panicked, rises] Mark, I'm scared!"
5211,4,16,Mark Cotner,[rises] Don't be scared. They're just kids. [to the kindergartners] Where are your parents?!
5212,4,16,Filmore,We already played with our parents.
5213,4,16,Jenny,"How, we wanna play wit' youuuu. [points at the couple]"
5214,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[silence] ...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out."
5215,4,16,Kindergartners,[come at the couple all at once] We wanna play wit' you! [jump on the couple]
5216,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Get off me! [twirls, but the kids don't fall off]"
5217,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Oh God, Mark! Help! [the couple goes towards the dividing line between Smiley Town and Treasure Cove]"
5218,4,16,Filmore,[clinging onto Linda] Oh no! She's crossing the white line!
5219,4,16,Kindergartners,Whoa! [fall off the couple and quickly rise to cross the line back to Treasure Cove. Spitballs come flying at them]
5220,4,16,Kindergartner,"Spitwads! [the launchers are seen: the sixth graders, Pip, Clyde, and Craig, with their straws.]"
5221,4,16,Craig Tucker,"[space helmet off] Take that, kindergartners!"
5222,4,16,Kindergartners,Ew! [all turn to leave. Jenny is the last to go. The older kids and the couple watch them leave]
5223,4,16,Mark Cotner,What the hell is gong on here?!
5224,4,16,Craig Tucker,[space helmet back on] Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.
5225,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!"
5226,4,16,Craig Tucker,I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
5227,4,16,Mark Cotner,The mayor! Good! Finally!
5228,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please? [Mark and Linda look at each other] Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions."
5229,4,16,Linda Cotner,You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
5230,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Parents? [his left-hand assistant (Francis) whispers in his ear and withdraws] Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around."
5231,4,16,Mark Cotner,No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
5232,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!"
5233,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?"
5234,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service."
5235,4,16,Mark Cotner,"No phones, either? How do you communicate?"
5236,4,16,Eric Cartman,"[opens up an empty jar and speaks into it] Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. [closes the lid on the jar as Francis waits on him and hands the jar to Francis. He hops down and goes out the door]"
5237,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? [the boy returns with the jar and hands it back to Cartman, who opens it up again]"
5238,4,16,Butter s Voice,"It's gonna be about three days. [Cartman looks at the couple, who stand speechless]"
5239,4,16,Eric Cartman,"[tosses the jar aside, and it breaks] So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. [moves a plate of treats forward] Ringy-ding?"
5240,4,16,Mark Cotner,I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
5241,4,16,Francis,SpitBall!
5242,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Aaahh! [jumps from his chair a second before a huge spitball crashes through the window and lands on the floor. He picks himself off the floor and goes to look out the window angrily] You sons of bitches! [turns to the couple] You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. [Mark and Linda, both unsure, look at each other]"
5243,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Mark, are we doing the right thing?"
5244,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!"
5245,4,16,Linda Cotner,I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
5246,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[stops and scolds] Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!"
5247,4,16,Linda Cotner,"[encouraging] Hey, I think you'd make a great father."
5248,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D- [moves forward again. Before them is a 20-ft John Elway statue.] Look, here's the book they've been talking about- [softly] it makes no sense."
5249,4,16,Linda Cotner,"My God! Mark! [in front of the statue is a small altar on which sit two kids. A dead dog is on the ground, and off to one side is a dead Kenny. Mark approaches him and inspects him closely] What is it??"
5250,4,16,Mark Cotner,"It's a boy. [reaches down to touch Kenny. Kenny's left hand and arm have been eaten away, leaving only the bones. Kenny's head turns when Mark touches him, and only the skull remains] They... killed him."
5251,4,16,Linda Cotner,"The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here."
5252,4,16,Kindergartners,Nah nah nanah nah!
5253,4,16,Linda Cotner,Na-a-ah! [older kids in costume enter the park and line up behind the kindergartners]
5254,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Oh no! [they both turn, only to face another group of kids. Both groups close in on them]"
5255,4,16,Linda Cotner,Mark!
5256,4,16,Mark Cotner,[to the kids] Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. [the angry mod captures them]
5257,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[wakes up first] Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up! [Mark awakens and both look at the group of kids, from kindergartners to fifth graders, staring back]"
5258,4,16,Kids,Nah nah nanah nah! [close in on the couple again]
5259,4,16,Stan Marsh,"You guys, stop it! [glides down from a tall pole in the school gym and jumps to a spot in front of the couple] Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes."
5260,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,[emerges from the group and stands next to Stan] Yeah. [these two head Treasure Cove]
5261,4,16,Mark Cotner,Why are you doing this?
5262,4,16,Stan Marsh,How come you wanna help the fatass?!
5263,4,16,Mark Cotner,Who?
5264,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,The fatass. The mayor.
5265,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than- [struggles to view his watch, but finally does] -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore."
5266,4,16,Stan Marsh,"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!"
5267,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?"
5268,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that."
5269,4,16,Linda Cotner,But what about before that?
5270,4,16,Stan Marsh,"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?"
5271,4,16,Linda Cotner,Yes!!
5272,4,16,Stan Marsh,"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?"
5273,4,16,Mark Cotner,I'll do anything to get to a phone!
5274,4,16,Stan Marsh,Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
5275,4,16,Kids,The Before time.
5276,4,16,Boy,The story of the before time.
5277,4,16,Stan Marsh,"[with a torch, walks up to a chalk drawing on a wall of a family] Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. [a drawing of broccoli is shown]"
5278,4,16,Kids,"Yuck, yuck, yuck."
5279,4,16,Stan Marsh,"[walks past a drawing of Cartman] And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. [stops at a drawing of two police officers arresting an adult, with a squad car in the background], by using the magic M word. [a large M is shown]"
5280,4,16,Kids,Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
5281,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. [a drawing of a statue]"
5282,4,16,Kids,Provider. Provider.
5283,4,16,Stan Marsh,"The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. [an angry Provider shoots bolts of lightning from his body, and two victims are at his feet]"
5284,4,16,Kids,Boo!
5285,4,16,Boy,Bwack bwack!
5286,4,16,Kids,Coosh!
5287,4,16,Stan Marsh,"So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. [the two books are shown, with the line between them]"
5288,4,16,Kids,"Carousel, Carousel."
5289,4,16,Stan Marsh,"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago."
5290,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?"
5291,4,16,Stan Marsh,Yes. No foolies.
5292,4,16,Kids,No foolies.
5293,4,16,Mark Cotner,"No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on. [pushes the front door of the school and it falls away] Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone."
5294,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Mark, I'm scared. [holds on to him]"
5295,4,16,Mark Cotner,"I know, but this will all be over soon."
5296,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!"
5297,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?"
5298,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, it's awful! Just awful."
5299,4,16,Speaker,"Alright parents, let's all take our seats. [Gerald and Sheila sit] My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor."
5300,4,16,Randy Marsh,"Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child."
5301,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Eh, neither did we."
5302,4,16,Mrs McCormick,"We didn't, either."
5303,4,16,Mr Evans,"Enough, enough! [all fall silent] Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most. [walks off and brings back a life-size stand-up of ""Beaver"" Cleaver] Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him. [no response from the inmates] Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body."
5304,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!"
5305,4,16,Mr Evans,"Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!"
5306,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,I don't have any urges!
5307,4,16,Mr Evans,"I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down! [Gerald thinks a moment, then sits down] Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu. [the adults remain silent, no objections] Now let's try again. [genuflects] Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!"
5308,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. [reaches the gas station and is horrified by what she sees. The couple's car has been placed on blocks and thoroughly stripped of its parts. Butters comes out from behind the car with a window handle]"
5309,4,16,Butters Stotch,"I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper."
5310,4,16,Linda Cotner,[backs up] Oh no. NO! [turns around and stops in her tracks.] Aaaah! [Cartman's group faces her]
5311,4,16,Eric Cartman,Where is your husband?
5312,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Uh, uh..."
5313,4,16,Eric Cartman,Seize her! [the others move forth]
5314,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Alright, I got the book for you. [hands it to Stan]"
5315,4,16,Stan Marsh,[receives it] Awesu-home!
5316,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Now, can I please have the cell phone?"
5317,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Sure, outlander. I'll get it [starts to move...]"
5318,4,16,Eric Cartman,[outside] Outlander! [all look in the direction of the sound]
5319,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!"
5320,4,16,Butters Stotch,Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
5321,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Butters, calm down, alright?"
5322,4,16,Mr Evans,"Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?"
5323,4,16,Man,[in back row] See a movie?
5324,4,16,Mr Evans,"Sure, ""see a movie""'s good. [writes it down on the blackboard] We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?"
5325,4,16,Mrs McCormick,Make a sweater?
5326,4,16,Mr Evans,"Uh huh. I'll put ah, ""knitting, sewing."" [writes them down] Who's got another one?"
5327,4,16,Blond Man,[to Liane's left] Molest children?
5328,4,16,Mr Evans,"Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children."
5329,4,16,Blond Man,Oh. Fishing?
5330,4,16,Mr Evans,Fishing's good. Uh huh. [writes that down]
5331,4,16,Eric Cartman,"I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! [gives her a small shock]"
5332,4,16,Linda Cotner,Mmrrhhhh!
5333,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Heh, heheh."
5334,4,16,Linda Cotner,Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
5335,4,16,Mark Cotner,Give him the book back.
5336,4,16,Stan Marsh,"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!"
5337,4,16,Eric Cartman,"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!"
5338,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! [goes to ungag his wife, and the statue's clock begins to peal: 8:00 p.m. An electric current makes its way down to a pool of water and returns to the statue, electrifying it. The right arm, holding a football, moves forward]"
5339,4,16,Eric Cartman,The Provider awakes!
5340,4,16,Stan Marsh,"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight."
5341,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Alright. [gets formal] It is decided. [points, in normal voice] Butters, your turn. [other kids back away. Tweek and another boy take Butters away.]"
5342,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!"
5343,4,16,Mark Cotner,Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
5344,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word."
5345,4,16,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too."
5346,4,16,Mark Cotner,What? [Butters makes his way to the altar on the dividing line. Tweek and three others monitor him]
5347,4,16,Butters Stotch,"I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! [Tweek and the other three chain him up]"
5348,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!"
5349,4,16,Stan Marsh,[all the kids turn from the altar and face the couple] Parents?
5350,4,16,Mark Cotner,"The birth-givers! Your birth-givers. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now. [beings to walk into the mob of kids] They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much. [Filmore and Jenny look at each other. Cartman gazes] Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this! [motions to the statue of John Elway] He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will."
5351,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Parents. Mom. Dad.
5352,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Oh boy, here it comes!"
5353,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[moves through the crowd again] If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. [stands next to Linda]"
5354,4,16,Stan Marsh,"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around."
5355,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
5356,4,16,Mark Cotner,Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
5357,4,16,Eric Cartman,Take him down. [Tweek and the other three unchain Butters]
5358,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway."
5359,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Here's our cell phone, dude. [hands it to Mark] Will you call the police for us? [Mark begins dialing]"
5360,4,16,Linda Cotner,Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
5361,4,16,Mark Cotner,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some."
5362,4,16,Linda Cotner,"Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! [turns around and starts walking away. Mark is surprised]"
5363,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!"
5364,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
5365,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner."
5366,4,16,Linda Cotner,"[shows up with Mark] Hey, kids."
5367,4,16,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you guys came back!"
5368,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Did you make it to your job interview?
5369,4,16,Mark Cotner,Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
5370,4,16,Linda Cotner,And I got my tubes tied.
5371,4,16,Kids,Alright!
5372,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are."
5373,4,16,Kids,Yeah.
5374,4,16,Butters Stotch,"Hey! Here they come! [the sound of a bus is heard. It pulls up and the parents pour out, beginning with the Broflovskis]"
5375,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Mom! Dad!
5376,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,Kids! [all the parents rush to their kids and hug them]
5377,4,16,Parents,"...Come here, come here."
5378,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,"[holds Ike] Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK. [Gerald hold Kyle]"
5379,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. We're fine.
5380,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now."
5381,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,But you didn't do anything to me.
5382,4,16,Gerald Broflovski,"Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it."
5383,4,16,Sheila Broflovski,It won't happen again. [She and Gerald turn and walk off with Ike.]
5384,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,"[lags] But, you guys, I--"
5385,4,16,Sharon Marsh,"[she and Randy hold Stan] Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't."
5386,4,16,Liane Cartman,"[genuflects next to Cartman] We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see."
5387,4,16,Stephen Stotch,"We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on."
5388,4,16,Butters Stotch,Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
5389,4,16,Mrs McCormick,"[walks with Stuart] Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he?"
5390,4,16,Jenny s Mother,"[she and the father hold Jenny] Everything's gonna be alright now, Jenny. [Jenny's father lets go] Come on, let's go home. [the families begin to disperse. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stay behind.]"
5391,4,16,Stan Marsh,Huh.
5392,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Huh.
5393,4,16,Mark Cotner,"[walks up with Linda] Well, what are you kids gonna do now?"
5394,4,16,Stan Marsh,I dunno. [to Kyle and Cartman] You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
5395,4,16,Kyle Broflovski,Sure. [the boys turn left and start walking]
5396,4,16,Eric Cartman,Snow igloos kick ass. [Mark and Linda stare as if the events of the last ten days didn't leave an impression on the boys]
5397,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike."
5398,4,17,Ike Broflovski,"[pulls himself onto the seat and looks in] Oooh nooo, poopies."
5399,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike. [lifts him off the seat and takes him back to the night stand] Come sit by me. [they sit down and face the toilet bowl, and wait. Nothing happens.]"
5400,4,17,Sheila Broflovski,"[at the door with Gerald] It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed."
5401,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does."
5402,4,17,Sheila Broflovski,"Alright, bubbe. [leaves with Gerald, but returns] Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah."
5403,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Happy Chanukah, Mom. [returns his sight to the toilet bowl and waits...]"
5404,4,17,Ike Broflovski,"[Waves the flag around] Ayaaa ta. [Kyle is getting drowsy] Weee! Weee... [soon, Ike is asleep on Kyle's shoulder as Kyle drifts into sleep, but checks on the plate once in a while. An ant is now on the toilet seat inching its way to the cookies. Kyle watches drowsily until the ant touches the cookies...]"
5405,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Go away!
5406,4,17,Stan Marsh,[picks up the phone] A-ah huh.
5407,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[barks. Music stops] Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
5408,4,17,Stan Marsh,Ho-o-oh.
5409,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, good. You're all here."
5410,4,17,Stan Marsh,"What is this all about, Kyle?"
5411,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
5412,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. [turns aside and walks off]"
5413,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come."
5414,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?"
5415,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!"
5416,4,17,Eric Cartman,Heh-tchoo!
5417,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns and glares at Cartman] Dude, you sneezed on my back!"
5418,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!"
5419,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look. [before them is a small cottage in a collection basin. They walk to the end of the sewer line] Hello?"
5420,4,17,Mr Hankey,Hoowwddyy ho! [behind him is a little cottage all glittered in light]
5421,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-"
5422,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle."
5423,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
5424,4,17,Mr Hankey,"I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family. [calls into the house] Honey!"
5425,4,17,Eric Cartman,Family?
5426,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn."
5427,4,17,Autumn,"Howdy-hey kids! [waves in the same way Mr. Hankey does, holds a martini in her left hand] Would you like a drink?"
5428,4,17,Mr Hankey,"They're too young to drink, honey."
5429,4,17,Autumn,"Hey haa, it's Christmas!"
5430,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids! [they come one one by one] This is our son, Cornwallis."
5431,4,17,Cornwallis,"[wearing glasses, a scarf and little blue beret] Hoowwdy Ho! [hops aside as another nugget enters]"
5432,4,17,Mr Hankey,Our daughter Amber.
5433,4,17,Amber,[in pink dress and maroon bow] Hoowwdy Ho! [hops aside as another nugget enters]
5434,4,17,Mr Hankey,"And our son, Simon."
5435,4,17,Simon,"Eee, hey! Hnhn."
5436,4,17,Mr Hankey,[aside] Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
5437,4,17,Siimon,Heh What? Dad? Huh?
5438,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Nothin', Simon."
5439,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
5440,4,17,Mr Hankey,It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
5441,4,17,Stan Marsh,"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore."
5442,4,17,Eric Cartman,My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
5443,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer! [the nuggets grin] And if you want, you can help them."
5444,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Sure we'll help! [Stan grins]
5445,4,17,Eric Cartman,Anything for more presents!
5446,4,17,Autumn,"""Hic"" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes?"
5447,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?"
5448,4,17,Autumn,But it's a Christmas party!
5449,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Honey, can we go inside for a second? [they enter the little house and start arguing. The boys look on in shock while the nuggets keep their smiles. Abruptly the arguing stops and the two adult poos step out again] Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!"
5450,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until- [a couple walks past] God-damnit! [a man walks past in the other direction] Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! [a woman walks by]"
5451,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Nobody's paying any attention. [Amber clears her throat as a foot comes down over Simon, and the foot pulls away]"
5452,4,17,Woman,"Ew, I almost stepped in it."
5453,4,17,Tele s Owner,"[exits and locks his door] Well, it was a good effort, boys. But I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's buyin' anything an' I can't afford to keep this furnace runnin'! [starts to leave, but notices the nuggets] Oh. And, boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk there. Watch out. [the nuggets look downcast. Red Harris leaves the toy store.]"
5454,4,17,Red Harris,"[locks the door] Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love. [starts sobbing, then walks away]"
5455,4,17,Stan Marsh,[emotionally] This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
5456,4,17,News Anchor,"And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS! [a chart appears] In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity. [the field poll follows]"
5457,4,17,Ms Choksondik,"Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh. [the boys sit on Cartman's sofa watching the news] I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke."
5458,4,17,Sound Man,"[with a son who waves at the camera] You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?"
5459,4,17,Man 2,"Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls."
5460,4,17,News Anchor,"Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong."
5461,4,17,Assistant,[whispers into the anchor's ear] In South Park.
5462,4,17,News Anchor,Oh really?
5463,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. [Cartman clicks the remote, and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" pops up. Charlie, Lucy, and Snoopy are on screen]"
5464,4,17,Charlie Brown,Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
5465,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again."
5466,4,17,Stan Marsh,How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
5467,4,17,"Charlie Brown
 Lucy
 Linus
 Snoopy","[as other kids dance around him] Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!"
5468,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!"
5469,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act."
5470,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[affecting a Peanuts accent] And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this."
5471,4,17,Eric Cartman,My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
5472,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it! [drops down from the sofa and walks to the TV] It's so simple!"
5473,4,17,Stan Marsh,"What, dude?"
5474,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns and faces the other boys] We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! [Charlie and Linus talk onscreen]"
5475,4,17,Stan Marsh,We don't know anything about animation.
5476,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,How hard can it be? Look at it. [Snoopy and Charlie walk in the woods]
5477,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!"
5478,4,17,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, right! Awesome!)"
5479,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" [onscreen, Snoopy is pummeling a naked Charlie Brown hard across the face with a 2-by-4]"
5480,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[worried] Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!"
5481,4,17,Aide 2,"Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you."
5482,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,Meugh. Send them in.
5483,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[as the boys enter]Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
5484,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,You do?
5485,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
5486,4,17,Stan Marsh,"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget."
5487,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[falsely enthusiastic] An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!"
5488,4,17,The Boys,Awww.
5489,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars."
5490,4,17,The Boys,Alright!
5491,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[to the other three] You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
5492,4,17,Mr Hankey,Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase! [now warning] Don't you throw that vase! [the vase is thrown and breaks.]
5493,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[now facing the house from the sewer] Ah, Mr. Hankey?"
5494,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[exits the front door] Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!"
5495,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[excited] We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card."
5496,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Oh, that's swell! Kids! [the nuggets come out] Christmas is back on! We've gotta all go get that old drive-in workin' again."
5497,4,17,The Nuggets,Okay!
5498,4,17,Autumn,"That's not the only thing we gotta get workin' again, [pokes him] if you know what I mean..."
5499,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[concerned] Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?"
5500,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. [turns and walks away...]"
5501,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry! [Cornwallis sniffs at himself]"
5502,4,17,Amber,"What's the matter, Cornwallis?"
5503,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got."
5504,4,17,Butters Stotch,"[behind a desk] Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me."
5505,4,17,Stan Marsh,[impatient] Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
5506,4,17,Butters Stotch,"Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus. [holds him up and moves him a bit] ""Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff"" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus. [brings him forth] ""Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff."" [Santa] ""Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose."" Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. [unfurls a large sheet which contains some mountains and spitting images of the four boys]"
5507,4,17,The boys,Whoa!
5508,4,17,Eric Cartman,"[points] Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat."
5509,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[retorts] That's not me, that's you!"
5510,4,17,Eric Cartman,What?!
5511,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"They kind of look like us. [the poster is shown again] I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us."
5512,4,17,Eric Cartman,"I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! [Butters sets the poster on the desk, face up]"
5513,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"God job, Butters."
5514,4,17,Butters Stotch,"Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film."
5515,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[grabs the poster] No, that's okay. [walks away]"
5516,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"See ya! [grabs Santa, Cartman grabs Jesus, and they walk away with Kenny]"
5517,4,17,Butters Stotch,"Uh-m, alright, alright then. [the door closes, and a few second later, he reaches into a top drawer and pulls out a Barbie cutout. In falsetto...] ""Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?"" [moves the Butters cutout] ""Huh, Butters, ma'am."" [moves the Barbie cutout while in falsetto]  ""Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?"" [moves the Butters cutout closer] ""Whoa! Well, uhuh"" [a smile of fantasy flashes across his face] ""Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again."" [guiltily puts the cutout away.]"
5518,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in."
5519,4,17,Cornwallis,"I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad."
5520,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[takes a seat at the table] Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas."
5521,4,17,Cornwallis,"It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas."
5522,4,17,Mr Hankey,"But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!"
5523,4,17,Autumn,"[drunk as ever, appears at the door] Come on, it's time to sit around the tree!"
5524,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[serious] We're having a talk, honey."
5525,4,17,Autumn,God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!
5526,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up."
5527,4,17,Autumn,That's not the only thing that can't get up around here. [rushes away]
5528,4,17,Mr Hankey,"...Now come on, son. Don't be so down."
5529,4,17,Cornwallis,Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.
5530,4,17,Mr Hankey,Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
5531,4,17,Cornwallis,"I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it."
5532,4,17,Mr Hankey,"No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?"
5533,4,17,Cornwallis,I'm nothing but crap!
5534,4,17,Mr Hankey,"But crap is everything. [begins to sing]
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
[Takes Cornwallis out and up to the street]
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
[cows graze on the some exposed grass while large birds fly lazily above]
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why

Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
[A cow poops as it eats, then Butters' family is shown eating burgers at table]
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
[Mr. Hankey sings to Cornwallis, then Butters' father is shown straining on the toilet]
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
[some poo descends through the pipe, and Mr. Hankey soon follows. A raw sewage outlet is then shown with Mr. Hankey exiting]
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
[plankton swarm the poo and devour it; a small fish eats the plankton]

And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
[a bigger fish eats the small fish, but an even bigger one approaches]
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
[the bigger fish swallows the medium-sized one and swims up to the surface, only to be snatched up by a bear]
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
[the bear walks off with the fish in its mouth and poos as he leaves]
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
[flowers and grass spring up through and around it. The camera pulls back to reveal an African savannah around the flowers, with all sorts of animals in it]

It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
[soft backup vocals come on, lending the song an African feel. antelope run in the background as a giraffe appears and stops]
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
[The camera looks at Mr. Hankey and Cornwallis atop Poo Rock, first from the back, then from the front]
''The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
[more cattle are shown grazing and pooing]
To make food for the humans and start all over again
[a man scoops the poo into a small bag and walks off; Butters and family eat more burgers; his mom sits on the toilet]
[back on Poo Rock, before which animals poo freely]

You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life."
5535,4,17,Cornwallis,"But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do."
5536,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[sits next to Cornwallis] Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all... [points to him] you."
5537,4,17,Cornwallis,"[smiles] I think I see now.
I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground
[steps forward]"
5538,4,17,Mr Hankey,Becomes the grass of tomorrow
5539,4,17,Cornwallis,Yeah
5540,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Which the grazers turn around 
[An antelope stops to poo a little, then runs off to join the others]"
5541,4,17,Cornwallis,So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen
5542,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again.
[Mr. Hankey holds Cornwallis high in the air on Poo Rock with the sky behind them. Cornwallis hums a bit]
That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!
[Cut to black]"
5543,4,17,Cornwallis,"Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again.
[Mr. Hankey holds Cornwallis high in the air on Poo Rock with the sky behind them. Cornwallis hums a bit]
That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!
[Cut to black]"
5544,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending."
5545,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. [they walk over to some microphones.]"
5546,4,17,Sound man,"[instructing] Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's."
5547,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What's a hard p?
5548,4,17,Eric Cartman,"You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?"
5549,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, yeah."
5550,4,17,Sound man,"Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and...  [cues the boys by raising his hand]"
5551,4,17,The boys,We wish you a Merry Christmas
5552,4,17,Sound man,Hold on.
5553,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"We wish- [the sound man presses a few buttons, and some white noise blasts through the boys' headphones]"
5554,4,17,The boys,[twisting in pain] AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
5555,4,17,Eric Cartman,...deh..OOOWW!!!
5556,4,17,Sound man,"Uh, [makes more changes to the sound settings] mmm. Okay, and? [cues the boys]"
5557,4,17,Boys,"We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--"
5558,4,17,Stan Marsh,Hey!  Wait a minute!
5559,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What?
5560,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
5561,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, yes, I think so."
5562,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[calmly] Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. [Kyle cues the piano player, who begins playing]"
5563,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--"
5564,4,17,Eric Cartman,"[grins] Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks."
5565,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[throws his headphones off and faces Cartman angrily] Don't you oppress me, fat boy."
5566,4,17,Eric Cartman,"[throws his headphones off] Don't call me fat, buttfucker."
5567,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
5568,4,17,Stan Marsh,"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! [the sound man begins to laugh heartily]"
5569,4,17,Sound man,"[composes himself] Dude, that was awesome."
5570,4,17,Stan Marsh,What's awesome?
5571,4,17,Sound man,The script. It's sweet.
5572,4,17,Stan Marsh,That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
5573,4,17,Sound man,"Well, it should be in the script. All that ""you're fat"" and ""you're a Jew"" and stuff. It's great. [the boys look at each other]"
5574,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame."
5575,4,17,Stan Marsh,Easy.
5576,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
5577,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas"
5578,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads. [sets the ""woo"" mouths in place] And then we shoot that for one frame."
5579,4,17,Stan Marsh,Okay. [snaps the shot] One.
5580,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! [exults]
5581,4,17,Stan Marsh,Kickass!
5582,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Now, the next mouth."
5583,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. [both turn aside to look around]"
5584,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, where are the E-mouths?"
5585,4,17,Stan Marsh,[softly] E mouths...
5586,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?"
5587,4,17,Stan Marsh,[snap] 1 [snap] 2.
5588,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,So how much done is that?
5589,4,17,Stan Marsh,"""We wish you a m- Merry"""
5590,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[softly] Aw, [loudly] Jesus Christ!"
5591,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[enters the drive-in with her aides] This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year."
5592,4,17,Johnson,This... place is pretty run-down.
5593,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming."
5594,4,17,Mr Hankey,[off-screen] Hoowwddy ho! [the Mayor and Johnson look around] Down here!
5595,4,17,Johnson,[jumps back] WAAGGH!
5596,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[displeased] Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful."
5597,4,17,Mr Hankey,My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
5598,4,17,Autumn,"[drunk and still holding a martini, to Johnson] Hi there, Mr. Important Political Person. *hic* [Johnson looks disturbed] You wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes and run naked through this parkin' lot?"
5599,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[softly blocking] Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!"
5600,4,17,Autumn,I didn't start it! He was looking at my breasts!
5601,4,17,Mr Hankey,"They're not real, you know."
5602,4,17,Autumn,"Don't you say that! [hugs him, but he pushes her off]"
5603,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!"
5604,4,17,Johnson,"Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup. [leads the Mayor and the other aide away]"
5605,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work."
5606,4,17,Cornwallis,"We can fix it up, Dad."
5607,4,17,Amber,"Oh, look! A homeless person. [the man is seen sleeping on the ground covered in papers and cardboard] Oh. He looks sad, Papa. [hops over to him and leaves a poo smile on his lips] There. That's better."
5608,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy [the man continues to sleep...]"
5609,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. [Cartman sneezes and immediately realizes what he just did]"
5610,4,17,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAAA!
5611,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
5612,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!"
5613,4,17,Stan Marsh,"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!"
5614,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways! [walks off and stops at the door] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!"
5615,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[rushing to the door] Fine! We'll do it with out you!
5616,4,17,Stan Marsh,"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!"
5617,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,We'll dub his voice over.
5618,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!"
5619,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.

To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.

You hope, and I'll hurry.
[takes the poster and rolls it up.]
You pray, and I'll plan
[The boys exit the Photo Dojo with it]
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
[now in Stan's room, works on a Brian Boitano cutout]
Even a miracle needs a hand!
[walks up to the wall and adds a scene to Act II]"
5620,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,You love-
5621,4,17,Stan Marsh,We love
5622,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,-And I'll labor. [takes down the scene]
5623,4,17,Stan Marsh,Tralala
5624,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,You sit- [puts it up again]
5625,4,17,Stan Marsh,We sit.
5626,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,-And I'll stand. [a funny look appears on his face]
5627,4,17,Stan Marsh,Tralalalala
5628,4,17,Boys,"Get help from our next-door neighbor, 'cause 
[Kenny begins to hum as the Hankey family is shown cleaning up the drive-in]"
5629,4,17,Boys,"Even a miracle needs a hand! 
[Autumn is passed out to one side of the film projector as Mr. Hankey cleans up]"
5630,4,17,Hankeys,"Even a miracle needs a hand! 
[Autumn is passed out to one side of the film projector as Mr. Hankey cleans up]"
5631,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?"
5632,4,17,Stan Marsh,"""Awgh! I'm so fat!"""
5633,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter."
5634,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[with tongue filling his mouth] ""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"""
5635,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Cool! Now let's try the script!
5636,4,17,Sound Man,Rolling...
5637,4,17,Stan Marsh,"[Doing his and Cartman's parts]
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!"
5638,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy."
5639,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Cartman:' Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! [both boys grin, and the sound man signals his approval with a thumbs-up]"
5640,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,You wish-
5641,4,17,Stan Marsh,We wish
5642,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,-And I'll whittle.
5643,4,17,Stan Marsh,Tralalalala
5644,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,You sit- [closes the box and tosses it up]
5645,4,17,Stan Marsh,We sit.
5646,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,-And I'll stand. [displays the box's destination and walks out with it]
5647,4,17,Stan Marsh,Tralalalala
5648,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[with Kenny humming] Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
[A group of 20 Korean inbetweeners are shown working hard on the short]"
5649,4,17,Boys,"Even a miracle- [a car comes in and runs over Kenny as the driver honks, leaving Kenny flat as a pancake. The boys just look in wonder]"
5650,4,17,Stan Marsh,...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. [they resume singing and walk away]
5651,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Even a miracle needs a hand!! 
[Stan opens the box and both boys lift the finished reel out of it: ""FROM KOREA: FINAL PRINT""]"
5652,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Even a miracle needs a hand!! 
[Stan opens the box and both boys lift the finished reel out of it: ""FROM KOREA: FINAL PRINT""]"
5653,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. [the crowd erupts in applause]"
5654,4,17,Eric Cartman,"[enters victoriously] Thank you, thank you. [Stan and Kyle look at him annoyed]"
5655,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!"
5656,4,17,Eric Cartman,"What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that."
5657,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"We know that after you see this darling short film, [the crowd is shown] you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?"
5658,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Mr. Hankey!"
5659,4,17,Mr Hankey,"[in the booth] O-kay! [starts the projector. The opening screen of ""The Spirit of Christmas"" is shown as music plays.]"
5660,4,17,Kids,"We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas,We wish you a merry Christmas--"
5661,4,17,Stan Marsh,Hey!  Wait a minute!
5662,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What?
5663,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?"
5664,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I think so."
5665,4,17,Stan Marsh,"(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!"
5666,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What?
5667,4,17,Stan Marsh,You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
5668,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
5669,4,17,Simon,"Eehhhh, pretty! [the crowd begins to disperse and grumble]"
5670,4,17,Sound Man,"Oh, that's Christmas for ya."
5671,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties."
5672,4,17,Man 2,Boring.
5673,4,17,Man 3,I've gotta go.
5674,4,17,Man 4,Stupid.
5675,4,17,Mr Hankey,[as the boys enter the projection booth] It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
5676,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,All that hard work.
5677,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!"
5678,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,But we spent it!
5679,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,Fine. Then we'll sue you. [leaves with the aides] Johnson? [the other aide stays behind]
5680,4,17,Aide,I... used to believe in miracles. [leaves]
5681,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,All that work!
5682,4,17,Stan Marsh,For nothing.
5683,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry."
5684,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey."
5685,4,17,Eric Cartman,I guess- we might as well- go home now. [the boys leave and Mr. Hankey wilts]
5686,4,17,Mr Hankey,It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
5687,4,17,Cornwallis,"But Dad, we can fix the projector."
5688,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap."
5689,4,17,Cornwallis,"Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything."
5690,4,17,Mr Hankey,"Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'"
5691,4,17,Cornwallis,"No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same."
5692,4,17,Mr Hankey,Son... [reflects for a moment] You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on! [the two of them leave the house]
5693,4,17,Sharon Marsh,"Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family."
5694,4,17,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,I wanna die. [sleigh music is heard and a light soon fills the air outside. All the Marshes look]
5695,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What the--
5696,4,17,Kenny McCormick,(Nooo!!) [tightens his hood]
5697,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,They did it! They got it working! [closes the door behind him]
5698,4,17,Jesus,"You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!"
5699,4,17,Santa,I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
5700,4,17,Jesus,Christmas is for celebrating my birth!
5701,4,17,Santa,Christmas is for giving!
5702,4,17,Crowd,"Oh, wow!"
5703,4,17,Amber,Mom! They got it working!
5704,4,17,Autumn,[opens the front door and exits without closing it] What's that? They got your father's penis workin' again? [the three of them leave]
5705,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
5706,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing."
5707,4,17,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, ham."
5708,4,17,Stan Marsh,[angrily] No not ham!
5709,4,17,Eric Cartman,Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
5710,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted."
5711,4,17,Stan Marsh,...Christmas is about something much more important!
5712,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,What?
5713,4,17,Stan Marsh,[voice softens] Presents.
5714,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] Ah.
5715,4,17,Stan Marsh,"Don't you see, Kyle?"
5716,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
5717,4,17,Stan Marsh,Presents.
5718,4,17,Various Folk,...Presents.
5719,4,17,Man 5,"My God, they're right!"
5720,4,17,Mr Mackey,"Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?"
5721,4,17,Randy Marsh,That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
5722,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"They're starting to understand, Johnson."
5723,4,17,Ms Choksondik,"We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive."
5724,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"[wearing a handlebar mustache, in falsetto] Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. [the crowd starts to clamor in agreement, and soon the shops around South Park turn their lights on. Red Harris opens his toy shop up, and the crowd fills the streets, first cheering, then chatting]"
5725,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!"
5726,4,17,Mr Hankey,"No, you did it, boys!"
5727,4,17,Autumn,"Aw, hell, we all did it!"
5728,4,17,Mayor McDaniels,"Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?"
5729,4,17,Stan Marsh,Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
5730,4,17,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
5731,4,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Stan] Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days."
5732,4,17,Stan Marsh,Wow! Count me in!
5733,4,17,Eric Cartman,Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
5734,4,17,Boys,"[leaving with the Mayor]
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!"
