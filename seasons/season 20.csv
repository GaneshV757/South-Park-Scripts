0,20,1,Jim,Hello everyone and welcome back. We are live at South Park Elementary School where the local girl's volleyball team is about to take on the Jefferson Sabers.
1,20,1,Mike,"And, hey Jim, it is packed. Sellout crowds tonight, first time in team history. Everyone turning out to see what's going to happen."
2,20,1,Jim,"[Camera switches to Nichole, who is stretching] That's right, Mike. All eyes are of course on fourth grader Nichole Daniels. Will she sit or stand for the National Anthem? [The crowd stare at her.]"
3,20,1,Mike,"This week with athletes all over the country sitting down for the National Anthem, [Two people are seen holding a banner reading 'WE SUPPORT YOU NICHOLE!'] the question on everyone's mind is ""What is this little girl gonna do?"""
4,20,1,Jimbo Kern,She's not gonna sit down. Why would she?
5,20,1,Randy Marsh,"Screw that. I've got 100 bucks riding on this. Come on, Nichole. Sit on it!"
6,20,1,Sports Commentator,Now please rise for the National Anthem. [they stand up.]
7,20,1,Randy Marsh,This is it.
8,20,1,Mike,"The National Anthem starts. Nichole Daniels seems to be waiting. So far no si... Oh! [The camera moves to Heidi Turner, who is sitting down.] And Heidi Turner is sitting down!"
9,20,1,Crowd,Ooh!
10,20,1,Jim,Might be totally unexpected. All eyes were on Nichole when Heidi Turner comes out of nowhere and sits down.
11,20,1,Mike,[Interrupting] And there goes Meghan Ridley! The crowd is going wild. What a turn of events! Let's check in with Dave.
12,20,1,Dave,"And Mike, I've just looked at the girl's Twitter accounts and it appears they are sitting out the National Anthem to protest the harassment and trolling they receive on the Internet."
13,20,1,Mike,"Complete surprise, Dave. Nobody saw this coming. Three girls now sitting down and finally, there goes Nichole."
14,20,1,Randy Marsh,"Wow, Yeah, 100 bucks!"
15,20,1,Jim,"And, as the anthem draws to a close, this thing is over."
16,20,1,Mike,"The final result, four athletes sitting out of the National Anthem, three of them not even black. A shocker here in South Park, thanks for joining us. [People start leaving]"
17,20,1,Stephen Stotch,"Oh my god, that was great. [The crowds empty out, leaving only a few left.]"
18,20,1,Referee,"Ah, play ball. [Blows whistle. The girls start playing.]"
19,20,1,PC Principal,"Alright, ladies. First of all I wanna say that I completely respect your decision to protest our national anthem. Thought it was sweet. I believe you shed some light on some very important issues regarding gender equality."
20,20,1,Heidi Turner,What are you doing about Eric Cartman?!
21,20,1,PC Principal,"Ladies, I understand you're upset about the trolling you've received on the Internet, but there is no evidence that Eric Cartman is Skankhunt42."
22,20,1,Wendy Testaburger,"It is him, it's completely obvious, and nobody is doing anything about it!"
23,20,1,PC Principal,Well he claims that he's been working at changing himself and the world around him. [presses the intercom button] Send in Mr. Cartman.
24,20,1,Eric Cartman,"[opens the door and enters] You wanted to see me, PC Principal?"
25,20,1,PC Principal,"Mr. Cartman, I'm gonna ask you one more time, are you or are you not the Internet troll Skankhunt42?"
26,20,1,Eric Cartman,"It's ""Skankhunt42"" and no I am not."
27,20,1,Heidi Turner,He's lying. Make him show you his phone.
28,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did."
29,20,1,Joe Biden,"Fellow Senators, our nation is divided like never before. While people everywhere fight for their voices to be heard, perhaps it is time for us to consider that our national anthem needs to be changed. Americans need an anthem that inspires and excites, an anthem that has something for everyone while still paying tribute to what it once was. I believe there's only one person capable of achieving this. [clicks on a handheld button and the picture behind him changes] J.J. Abrams."
30,20,1,Senators,[murmuring among themselves] J.J. Abrams!
31,20,1,Joe Biden,"He saved Star Wars, and now we will ask him to save our country."
32,20,1,Lady Senator,"[over a megaphone] Mr. Abrams? Mr. Abrams, we need to speak with you."
33,20,1,Male Senator,"Look, there. [a light comes on at the left end of the second floor, and a shadow stops by the window]"
34,20,1,Lady Senator,[over the megaphone] Mr. Abrams I speak on behalf of Americans everywhere. We've come to ask you to reboot the national anthem. Please Mr. Abrams. We know you've been asked to reboot a lot.
35,20,1,Senator 2,[whispering] We know you're tired.
36,20,1,Lady Senator,We know you're tired.
37,20,1,Senator 3,"[takes the megaphone] What do you say, sir? We all want something new and that makes us remember the things we lost. We want to 'member! We need your 'member berries! [Abrams mulls it over]"
38,20,1,Male Senator,"One light means yes, two lights means no. [Abrams reaches to his left and one light comes on. The gathered crowd goes wild.]"
39,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of Skankhunt42 has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students believe that it's just because girls don't have a sense of humor. I beg to disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wendy Testaburger, guys. [some of the kids clap, Wendy stands up and walks over to Cartman] Wendy, go ahead. Be funny. [he holds the mic to her face, and she looks at him warily. He tried harder, she leans farther away] Say something funny, Wendy. We can't wait."
40,20,1,Wendy Testaburger,I'm not funny.
41,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say ""my vagina"" a lot.."
42,20,1,Wendy Testaburger,I don't feel like being funny right now.
43,20,1,Eric Cartman,"And that's just the kind of sexist bull-crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen. Sit your ass down. [Wendy goes back to her spot on the gym floor] This isn't a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. Bebe, why don't you come up here? Come on, Bebe."
44,20,1,Bebe Stevens,NO!
45,20,1,Eric Cartman,"No? Come on, talk about havin' sex with guys, and say ""vagina"" and stuff like that. Go ahead. [looks her over quickly] Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. Seriously."
46,20,1,Bebe Stevens,Get the mic out of my face!
47,20,1,Eric Cartman,"[moves away] Huh. Oh my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird. Um, let's see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly?"
48,20,1,Nelly,"Yeah, I got one. You're a fat fuck! [Butters got a great laugh out of that one]"
49,20,1,Eric Cartman,"K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry."
50,20,1,Nelly,"[stands up] You see, what the problem is, is that when a little troll is allowed to say anything he wants anonymously, then he speaks for all you boys!"
51,20,1,Eric Cartman,"K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now."
52,20,1,Nelly,Go ahead and get on our school message board and see what he's saying about us! Then see if you guys think it's funny!
53,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, ""my vagina."""
54,20,1,News Anchor 1,"And as our country seems to be more and more divided, the only hope is that J.J. Abrams' new national anthem will appeal to everyone and bring back those nostalgic member berries we know and love."
55,20,1,Randy Marsh,Oh great. Everything's getting a reboot now. [There's a knock on the door and he answers it.]
56,20,1,Pollster,Hello sir. I'm with the Gallup poll. We're trying to get a read on how people will be voting in the upcoming Presidential election?
57,20,1,Randy Marsh,Oh. Oh-okay.
58,20,1,Pollster,Great. And will you be voting for the giant douche or the turd sandwich?
59,20,1,Randy Marsh,"Well, this is usually a giant douche household but... we're going firmly with the turd sandwich."
60,20,1,Pollster,"Oh, the turd sandwich, huh?"
61,20,1,Randy Marsh,That's right. [Sharon appears behind him and sees him talking to the Pollster] You can put my wife and I both down for turd sandwich.
62,20,1,Pollster,"Well, good luck with that, heh. So far, giant douche is leading in the polls."
63,20,1,Randy Marsh,[shocked] What?
64,20,1,Randy Marsh,What the hell is wrong with people?! They really think that a giant douche should be President?? It's insane!
65,20,1,Sharon Marsh,"Why'd you say I'd be voting for the turd sandwich, Randy? You haven't even talked to me about it."
66,20,1,Randy Marsh,You can't possibly be thinking about voting for the douche?!
67,20,1,Stan Marsh,Hhhawgh!
68,20,1,Randy Marsh,What's wrong with you?
69,20,1,Stan Marsh,I just don't understand why every four years you people freak out over whether to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich.
70,20,1,Randy Marsh,[snidely] Because we're Americans. 'Cause this is America
71,20,1,Stan Marsh,Why are we doing this again? Why are we back to giant douche and turd sandwich?
72,20,1,Randy Marsh,"[holds his palms out like fans] Cyyynical. Cynical maaan. You just think everything and everyone is dumb, huh? 'Cause you're a nihilist."
73,20,1,Stan Marsh,It's nihilist.
74,20,1,Randy Marsh,"See, you're such a nihilist."
75,20,1,News Anchor 2,Newest Gallup Poll results are in and they show Giant Douche to be leading Turd Sandwich by nearly 10%. Turd Sandwich has said there's no reason to panic.
76,20,1,Hillary Clinton Turd Sandwich,"Polls are of course a useful tool, but they can often be misleading. Our campaign is holding strong."
77,20,1,Reporter 1,[after some clamor from the press corps] Mrs. Turd Sandwich?
78,20,1,Hillary Clinton,"Yes, Arthur?"
79,20,1,Arthur,"Uh, Mrs. Sandwich, do you believe that your opponent will gain any momentum from this poll?"
80,20,1,Hillary Clinton,"I'm sure that like me, Giant Douche realizes that polls are never the final answer."
81,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah! Suck that poll you dumb bitch! Up 10%. Can you believe that shit?! [walks over to the table on which the radio sits] Oh, Caitlyn. I think we're really gonna win this thing! Think about it. [softly, awed] In a couple of months I will be President of the United States. [begins to worry and turns off the radio] Caitlyn, can I ask you somethin'? Uh, when we actually get into the White House, like um, what are we gonna do?"
82,20,1,Caitlyn Jenner,What do you mean?
83,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Well I mean, like, you know, once we're President and Vice-President, like, what do we do then?"
84,20,1,Caitlyn Jenner,How the fuck should I know?
85,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"[getting exasperated] Cait, you, you heard about the poll, right? We're probably gonna win. Don't tell me you don't have a plan."
86,20,1,Caitlyn Jenner,What plan? I thought you had a plan.
87,20,1,Mr. Garrison,I don't have any fuckin' plan! That's why I have you! I'm gonna be the President and you're gonna be in charge of all foreign and domestic policies!
88,20,1,Caityln,I thought you were gonna do that part.
89,20,1,Mr. Garrison,Are you tellin' me that we're about to be voted into office and we have no idea what the fuck we're gonna do?? [makes two fists] Ohhh Jeeez!
90,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I think they called it German Collective Guilt, right? Where even the Germans who just did nothing while Hitler rose to power were, were maybe somehow also responsible?"
91,20,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh huh, uh, m'kay, okay."
92,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"But I can't control what Cartman does, so, so why should I feel ashamed for what Cartman does?"
93,20,1,Mr Mackey,"Well J.J. Abrams was just rebooting the National Anthem, Kyle, so everything's gonna be fine, m'kay?"
94,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,I don't think the answer to all this is member berries.
95,20,1,Mr Mackey,You don't like mem- member berries?
96,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Agh, never mind. I'm just gonna stay out of it. [gets up and leaves the office. A few seconds later, Mr. Mackey opens a drawer in his desk and pulls out a mason jar with member berries in it. He opens the jar and lifts the berries out]"
97,20,1,Berries,"Oh I 'member. 'Member Chewbacca? Yeah. And 'member AT-ATs? Member? Ey! Hey, 'member Ghostbusters? Ohh, I 'member. 'Member Slimer? Oh, I loved Slimer. 'Member? Ohh, I 'member. [they keep 'membering]"
98,20,1,Mr Mackey,How could someone think these things are bad? [plucks a berry and eats it]
99,20,1,Decision 2016 Announcer,"The Commander in Chief Forum, with a giant douche and a turd sandwich."
100,20,1,Moderator,"Back now with the Commander in Chief Forum. I am joined by the Republican nominee, a giant douche."
101,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks, Matt."
102,20,1,Matt,"Mr. Douche, some say you don't actually have a viable plan in place if you were to be elected President."
103,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Huh! Huh well, well who said that? The turd sandwich?"
104,20,1,Matt,"In your campaign, you said that you will deal with our country's immigrants and enemies by personally [reading his notes] fucking them all to death. How do you plan to actually achieve that?"
105,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Well, Matt, I don't think I said I would fuck them all to death."
106,20,1,Matt,"Okay, well, let's roll the tape on that."
107,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, sure, okay. [they sit back as clips from previous statements are aired. First, from the time the fleeing Canadian kids were enrolled at South Park Elementary] Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's ""fuck them all to death!"" [At Niagara Falls] Fuck them all to death! Let's make this country great again!"
108,20,1,Crowd,Fuck them all to death!
109,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"[St. Louis] And then I'm gonna take all the drug pushers in our country, and I'm gonna fuck them-! [another rally] And you know those people in Syria, I'm gonna fuck them! [in Washington, D.C., all worked up] That's how we'll make sure that every terrorist on earth is fuckin' dead! [in a desert] The leaders of North Korea? I'll fuck them all, yeah! [Club Emotion] Yeah! Yeah! [another rally] The criminals in our jails?! Fuckin' dead a day after I- [another rally] Yeah! Those ads that are tryin' to kill us? I'll fuck anyone in the advertising business! And they'll all die too!"
110,20,1,Matt,"So by our estimates, it's roughly 7.6 million people you have promised to fuck to death in your first year of office."
111,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Uh huh, okay."
112,20,1,Matt,"And, and, you think that's achievable?"
113,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"I do. I do, Matt. Uh, I mean, I'm not gonna just get elected, you know, and, and look like a jackass. Huh, huhuh. [fearfully] Ohhh Jeeez."
114,20,1,Preschool Teacher,"Alright kids, today we have a very special treat. One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you. Come on over, Eric."
115,20,1,Eric Cartman,[enters] Hi guys! [takes a seat] Are you all ready to hear a story?
116,20,1,Preschoolers,Yeah!
117,20,1,Eric Cartman,"This was a book I created all with my imagination. It's called ""Little Red Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was a little black boy named Token."" Get over it. ""But then, a big bad wolf who was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said 'I have a large vagina' and traded place-"" [Kyle enters and pull him out of the room.]"
118,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing?!
119,20,1,Eric Cartman,Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls.
120,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,You really think you're fooling anyone with this fake persona?! Everyone knows you're acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the Internet at night!
121,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Why would I do that, Kyle?"
122,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't really care! Just don't drag me into it! [takes Cartman's book and slams it down on the floor, then walks away angrily]"
123,20,1,Randy Marsh,"What is wrong with people, huh?! How can they vote against a turd sandwich more than a giant douche?! It's senseless!"
124,20,1,Stephen Stotch,"Randy, you gotta calm down."
125,20,1,Randy Marsh,[grabs onto Stephen] How can anyone be calm at a time like this?! [lets go] People actually think a turd is worse than a douche!
126,20,1,Stephen Stotch,"Look, maybe you need some supplements to help calm your nerves. Have you heard of member berries?"
127,20,1,Randy Marsh,Member berries?
128,20,1,Stephen Stotch,It's a new superfruit that helps you mellow out and relax.
129,20,1,Berries,"'Member The Fugitive? 'Member Akira? 'Member Alien Nation? Yeah, I 'member..."
130,20,1,Stephen Stotch,"The guys at work told me about them. Been taking them about six months now. I'll telling you, they really take the edge off."
131,20,1,Berries,'Member Explorers? The little kids in a spaceship? 'Member storm troopers? 'Member?
132,20,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh, they're adorable. [plucks one and eats it]"
133,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Come on, people! I need answers! Real solutions! You're my advisers, for Christ's sake! How do we do this?!"
134,20,1,Adviser 1,"Maybe, if you swam in a pool in Florida, you could contract the Zika virus. Then you fuck all the people you can, and hope they eventually die."
135,20,1,Mr. Garrison,That would take way too long! And there's no guarantee every pool in Florida has Zika!
136,20,1,Adviser 2,Could you use nuclear weapons? Then fuck all the bodies after the fact?
137,20,1,Mr. Garrison,[walks to the table and takes a seat] Ugh! What the hell do I do? If I win I won't be able to do what I promised. But every day I keep going up in the polls. Why did the Democrats have to elect such a turd sandwich?
138,20,1,Caitlyn Jenner,Maybe you should just quit.
139,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"If I quit, I look like a total jackass. [gets up and walks away, stopping by the ""Pin The Tail On The Donkey"" picture with Hillary's face on it.] If I win the election, I look like a total jackass. I have to keep running, [turns to face the picture] but I have to make sure she wins."
140,20,1,Butters Stotch,"Haha! You guys see what Skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he photo shopped a picture of Heidi Turner's mom with a dick in her mouth!"
141,20,1,Craig Tucker,I wanna see.
142,20,1,Butters Stotch,[shows the other boys] Look! There's Wendy's mom with a dick in her mouth too! [Jimmy laughs and takes a closer look]
143,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,Goddammit! [takes the phone from Butters] Do you guys even care how this makes the girls feel?!
144,20,1,Craig Tucker,We didn't do it.
145,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We all know who did! And if we don't do something, then the girls will eventually retaliate against us!"
146,20,1,Eric Cartman,[from a distance] Help! [the other boys see him as he runs to them] Help me! Augh! Aw! [reaches the other boys]
147,20,1,Butters Stotch,Eric! What happened!
148,20,1,Eric Cartman,"A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this vagina on my face! [well, it's there, but with a pair of testicles attached to it] They said it was to send a message!"
149,20,1,Clyde Donavon,That's a vagina?
150,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. See, here's the top of the vagina and there's the balls. [Kyle has lost interest]  It's starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore!"
151,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,[flatly] I didn't know vagina had balls.
152,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?"
153,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You're just trying to start a war, aren't you?!"
154,20,1,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?"
155,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not gonna work, Cartman! I'm not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore! when this whole thing comes to an end, you're gonna be all on your own! [walks away]"
156,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Hello sir, how are you today? I'm calling from the Campaign for President, just seeing if uh, I can get your support for Hillary Clinton today. Yes, I know she's a turd sandwich, but you know if ya, if you look past that, you know she, she really has a lot to offer. Well, I hear you, but sometimes in life you just gotta suck a turd, you know? Hello? [hangs the phone up up with anger] Dammit! This is impossible! Are you having' any success, Caitlyn?!"
157,20,1,Caitlyn Jenner,"I've tried to get people on board, but she's just such a turd sandwich. You're just gonna have to do something awful to throw the election."
158,20,1,Mr. Garrison,Every time I do something awful people just get more stoked on me! It's impossible to piss people off anymore!
159,20,1,Anchor 2,This is breaking news. The moment has arrived. It is here. J.J. Abrams says he has finished the new National Anthem.
160,20,1,Mr. Garrison,Turn it up.
161,20,1,Anchor 2,The anthem is sure to be fresh and exciting while recapturing the moments we all knew and loved. Democratic nominee Turd Sandwich said she will be in attendance to show her support for the rebooted anthem.
162,20,1,Mr. Garrison,Ohhh Jeeez.
163,20,1,Anchor 2,Let's all hope that this new anthem puts our differences aside and unites this nation once again.
164,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"That's it, Cait. That's what I have to do. I'm gonna sit out the National Anthem on live television. Then everyone will have to vote for that turd sandwich!"
165,20,1,Berries,'Member Spock? Yeah. 'Member tricorders? I 'member. And 'member Bionic Man?
166,20,1,Randy Marsh,"Ohh, I 'member."
167,20,1,Berry,Oh I loved Bionic Man [Randy plucks him and eats him.]
168,20,1,Berries,"'Member the Millennium Falcon? 'member Chewbacca again? Oh I love to 'member Chewbacca. I 'member. 'Member? Hey hey hey! 'Member when there weren't so many Mexicans? Oh, I 'member."
169,20,1,Randy Marsh,Wai- what?
170,20,1,Berries,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! 'Member when marriage was just between a man and a woman? I 'member! Oh, I 'member. Oh yeahhh."
171,20,1,Randy Marsh,"[fondly] Yeeah, I remember that. [catches himself] Wait."
172,20,1,Berries,"'Member feeling safe? 'Member no ISIS? 'Member Reagan? Ohh, I 'member. Ooo, 'member? Ooo, 'member? [Randy sits up and spits out what's left of the berries he's eaten]"
173,20,1,Randy Marsh,What the fuck's going on with these member berries?
174,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah?
175,20,1,Eric Cartman,[opens the door and comes in] Hey broship. Got a minute?
176,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing here??
177,20,1,Eric Cartman,"You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls."
178,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,I'm going to the bathroom!
179,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem."
180,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[finishes up and hops off the toilet, pulling his pants up] They sat it out because you were harassing them online."
181,20,1,Eric Cartman,Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?
182,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why would you care?!
183,20,1,Eric Cartman,"'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too??"
184,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"If we could just prove who the troll was, then the girls wouldn't be wanting a war, would they?!"
185,20,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah but... you can't track down an Internet troll, [peers down into the toilet] it's too bad."
186,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Just know this, Cartman! I'm going to prove who Skankhunt 42 is, whatever it takes! Everyone is going to know! And Skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's! ever! said!"
187,20,1,Mike,"Hello everyone, we are live at tonight's game between the '49ers and the Panthers, but of course what everyone is really here for, the unveiling of the new National Anthem rebooted by J.J. Abrams."
188,20,1,Jim,"And Mike, this new anthem is said to have everything the old one had but, some new surprises as well. You'd have to be an absolute asshole not to stand and support it."
189,20,1,Mike,"This is such a big night for America that both Presidential candidates are here. [Hillary stands up and waves to the camera] There you can see the Turd Sandwich waving to all four people excited by her. [A shot of Garrison and Jenner in their own box, with Garrison waving happily to the crowd] And there's the Giant Douche doing the same."
190,20,1,Mr. Garrison,When I sit down to not support this thing I'm sure to lose this election!
191,20,1,Decision 2016 Announcer,Ladies and Gentlemen-
192,20,1,Mr. Garrison,Here it is!
193,20,1,Jim,"And the Anthem begins, let's hope this fixes America."
194,20,1,Decision 2016 Announcer,"For our National Anthem we now ask you all in solidarity to please rise. [Garrison sits down] Or sit, or take a knee, in order to honor America. [Kaepernick, who has taken a knee, is as confused as anyone else]"
195,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"Wait a min- what, wait, what? Wait. [tries to strike a pose that isn't standing, sitting, or kneeling, but gets nothing.]"
196,20,1,Jim,"Ohhh! And J.J. Abrams has absolutely shattered expectations, Mike! Now whether people are standing, sitting, or kneeling, they are all honoring America. J.J. Abrams is a wizard, Tom. A wizard. [Colin Kaepernick is also trying to figure out what to do]"
197,20,1,Mike,More people sitting now as Abrams has made it irrelevant. Who saw this coming?
198,20,1,Jim,"And there's the rest of the Anthem, all the parts we remembered and loved. J.J. Abrams has fixed America."
199,20,1,Mr. Garrison,"No, this was supposed to! Oh! OHHH JEEEZ!"
200,20,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[opens the bedroom door] Hey Kyle. [Kyle looks at him] You okay, son?"
201,20,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah Dad. Just thinkin'.
202,20,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Well um, I'll be in my office if you wanna talk. [leaves and closes the door. He walks to his office at the end of the hallway]"
203,20,2,Dr Wayne Schroeder,"Nobody is safe. Nobody can hide from these monsters. Internet trolls are truly predators of society. As parents we find it hard to believe our children are doing these things online, and that is why I've been asked to come and speak to you about the student who has been trolling your school message boards."
204,20,2,Dr Schroeder,This troll is known only as Skankhunt42. [He cycles to the next slide.]
205,20,2,Dr Schroeder,"We believe it probable he's one of the boy students here, since his favorite target seems to be women. Here, you can see Heidi Turner's mother photo shopped with a penis in her mouth, after she defended her daughter's right to sit out the national anthem."
206,20,2,Dr Schroeder,"Since then, this child has been trolling all over the internet. Visiting message boards, and social media, and filling it with vile comments and hate-filled garbage. [The camera pans to Gerald smiling as Dr. Schroeder talks.]"
207,20,2,Dr Schroeder,"But trolling is on the rise with teenagers, and we all need to come together to stop it. We need every parent to look for the signs in their own child."
208,20,2,Dr Schroeder,"In order for us to find these secretive monsters, we need all parents to ask themselves: ""Could my child be a troll?""."
209,20,2,Sheila Broflovski,"My God, what children are capable of now. What kind of hate would have to be in that child's heart?"
210,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, you never know, could be someone who just, kind of thinks it's funny to stir the pot and watch everyone freak out. [Sheila gives Gerald a questioning look]"
211,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, you know! Maybe the fact that it's so not funny makes it somehow funny, to kids? Gosh, I-I certainly don't understand it."
212,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what's going on?"
213,20,2,Clyde Donovan,You didn't hear?
214,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,Hear what? What happened?
215,20,2,Stan Marsh,Heidi Turner. She... she quit Twitter.
216,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no. [Heidi walks past them, looking down.]"
217,20,2,Stan Marsh,"Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good."
218,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,She'll get back on.
219,20,2,Stan Marsh,"No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone."
220,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Alright students, I know we're all dealing with the loss of a good friend. We have to accept the fact that Heidi won't be on social media anymore. I know we're all gonna miss her, m'kay. We're gonna miss, seeing what she's up to; miss seeing her silly pictures she'd post of her and her friends, m'kay."
221,20,2,Mr Mackey,But this is what can happen when someone gets bullied online to the point they just can't go on anymore. [Kyle angrily looks over at Cartman.]
222,20,2,Mr Mackey,"I know that some of you are feeling anger, m'kay. [Annie, Wendy, and Nichole are angrily looking down] Some of you are feeling a little guilt, asking how something like this can happen. But the best thing we can do for Heidi, is come together as friends, and as students, m'kay."
223,20,2,Mr Mackey,"So now, why don't we all get on Twitter, m'kay, and just tweet some of the, things we loved about Heidi, m'kay?"
224,20,2,Mr Mackey,"M'kay. Oh, that's nice, that's nice, m'kay. Oh, that's a good one Sarah, uh-huh. That-that's a - that's a pretty poem. Nice Butters. Oh, Heidi would have loved this so much. This is so special, m'kay."
225,20,2,Stan Marsh,"Okay. Can we all agree now, [Stan glares at Cartman] that whoever is doing this, needs to stop?"
226,20,2,Eric Cartman,"Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough. [Kyle looks unimpressed.] The girls are really pissed off at us. [He drinks from a milk carton.]"
227,20,2,Stan Marsh,"So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it!"
228,20,2,Eric Cartman,"You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight! [Kyle still looks unimpressed.] I am so, seriously."
229,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Ike? Can I talk to you? [Takes a seat on Ike's bed] Come on, pull up a chair."
230,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"You know, we had a big parent meeting at the school tonight, and uh, apparently, there's someone trolling the school message boards and, putting... penises in people's mouths. And whoever it was then got a big reaction from it, so he's now putting penises in people's mouths all over the internet. And... he's actually getting pretty famous!"
231,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Sooo, Annie Jerkin's mother started an online campaign to stop internet trolling with a picture of her and her daughter, and you know what happened? She got a dick in her mouth!"
232,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Ha-okay, okay, I know, it's just guy humor stuff, you know. We can laugh about about it here, but, it is serious too. Well, love you pal. Get to sleep, it's a school night."
233,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, hey!"
234,20,2,Sheila Broflovski,Did you talk to him?
235,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, yeah, we talked. It was good."
236,20,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, that's good."
237,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, well, I'd better go and get some of my work done."
238,20,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, right, right, yeah."
239,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, don't wait up. I'll be a while with these stupid case profiles."
240,20,2,Sheila Broflovski,All right. Night Gerald.
241,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,Night sweetie. [Gerald receives a kiss from Sheila]
242,20,2,Woman 1,Hey! Just wanna remind everyone about the ice cream social to benefit homeless teens. Looking for volunteers.
243,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, I'd like to volunteer to kick you in the vagina! Where do I sign up?!"
244,20,2,Woman 2,This is my daughter at the triathlon today! Go little girl!
245,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,Your daughter has a mustache - what the hell is wrong with your ovaries bitch?!
246,20,2,Commentator,You've been dick-slapped!
247,20,2,Bebe Stevens,You should've seen what he said about my mother on her Instagram! Pages and pages of disgusting things!
248,20,2,Annie Knitts,This is an attack on all of us! It's time to make the boys suffer!
249,20,2,Wendy Testaburger,It has to be swift and serious. We have to make a statement. The girls in South Park aren't going to be treated like afterthoughts anymore!
250,20,2,Girls except Heidi Turner,Yeah!
251,20,2,Annie Knitts,This has gone on too long and it's time to do something!
252,20,2,Girls except Heidi Turner,Yeah!
253,20,2,Clyde Donovan,[The boys are now the focus.] What do you think they're talking about?
254,20,2,Butters Stotch,"They're talking about how they're gonna get us - what do you think? That's how the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to, even if you didn't do nothing!"
255,20,2,Butters Stotch,What are we gonna do about them?
256,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,The girls want to see Cartman punished so we have to prove it's him.
257,20,2,Craig Tucker,We're never gonna prove that and you know it! We have to make him stop!
258,20,2,Butters Stotch,"He's not gonna stop, he's loving all this! He wants the girls to hurt us!"
259,20,2,Clyde Donovan,Then let's end it.
260,20,2,Jimmy Valmer,What do you mean?
261,20,2,Clyde Donovan,Cartman is the cause of all our problems. Always. We all know what has to be done.
262,20,2,Clyde Donovan,It's not like we haven't talked about it before - fantasized about how we'd do it.
263,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but not like we'd actually do it."
264,20,2,Stan Marsh,Clyde's right.
265,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,Stan... You can't be thinking that we'd-
266,20,2,Stan Marsh,What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is.
267,20,2,Token Black,He pushed everyone too far.
268,20,2,Butters Stotch,"It's him, or us!"
269,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,Are we seriously talking about doing this?
270,20,2,Craig Tucker,How would we ever get away with it?
271,20,2,Stan Marsh,We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go.
272,20,2,Eric Cartman,'Sup dudes?
273,20,2,Stan Marsh,"After school, we're gonna go to my uncle's cabin - in the woods. We're gonna have a slumber party and play Counter Strike all night with no one around to bother us."
274,20,2,Eric Cartman,[Stands up excited] Are you serious?! All night broship Counter Strike party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi?
275,20,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food."
276,20,2,Eric Cartman,"Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever!"
277,20,2,Berries,"'Member TIE fighters? Oh, 'member Jawas? 'Member? Hey, 'member Jurassic Park? Ooh, you love Jurassic Park. 'Member Jeff Goldblum? Oh, I 'member Jeff Goldblum - he was really tasty. [Mr. Mackey plucks one berry and eats it] I love Jeff Goldblum. 'Member?"
278,20,2,Mr Mackey,Mueeh...
279,20,2,Scott Malkinson,I can't do this anymore! I can't take it!
280,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Oh! Er, hi Scott.[Scott sits on the chair in front of Mr. Mackey.]"
281,20,2,Scott Malkinson,Nobody ever pays attention to me! Nobody cares! I just want to end it all!
282,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Scott, come on, we've talked about this. You don't wanna quit Twitter."
283,20,2,Scott Malkinson,Why not?! Everyone would be happier if I did!
284,20,2,Mr Mackey,Who'd be happier?
285,20,2,Scott Malkinson,Everyone.
286,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Well, what about your parents, huh? How'd you think they'd feel if you quit Twitter?"
287,20,2,Scott Malkinson,I don't think they'd even notice!
288,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Of course they'd notice. They'd be saad, m'kay, they'd be saad. You've got so much ahead of you Scott; so many posts and tweets still ahead of you. You haven't even started to see what social media has to offer you. You can't-you can't just end it all. Not now."
289,20,2,Scott Malkinson,"You're right, I guess I don't want to quit Twitter."
290,20,2,Mr Mackey,"There you go, m'kay? But now you come back here anytime you're having bad thoughts, m'kay?"
291,20,2,Scott Malkinson,"Okay, thanks."
292,20,2,Scott Malkinson,Twitter would be better off without me! I'm quitting!
293,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Okay, okay. Now, Scott-[Scott takes the seat again]"
294,20,2,Scott Malkinson,What's the point!? Better to just end it all now!
295,20,2,Mr Mackey,O-kay...
296,20,2,Eric Cartman,This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing Counter Strike all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Token?
297,20,2,Token Black,"Yeah, I'm really excited."
298,20,2,Eric Cartman,I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse.
299,20,2,Clyde Donovan,I'm sure you will.
300,20,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?"
301,20,2,Stan Marsh,Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much.
302,20,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play Counter Strike. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now?"
303,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,We're almost there.
304,20,2,Eric Cartman,"This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome."
305,20,2,Man,Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my God!
306,20,2,Supervisor,[Walks to the man.] What's wrong?
307,20,2,Man,Someone keeps trolling our campaign site!
308,20,2,Man,"He just keeps leaving horrible comments, and now he's attacking me personally!"
309,20,2,Supervisor,"Aww, don't let him get to you."
310,20,2,Man,Don't let him-?! He took a picture I posted and put a dick in my mouth! Who does that?!
311,20,2,Supervisor,Someone who probably still lives with his mother and hates himself. He obviously has nothing better to do. Just let him wallow in his own misery.
312,20,2,Berries,"'Member the Cantina? Oh-hoh, I 'member. 'Member Star Destroyers? Yeah, I love Star Destroyers! 'Member?"
313,20,2,Woman 3,[To the cashier.] I have a coupon for that too. An-and those are 6 for $4 with this coupon. [To Gerald] Sorry.
314,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, no please. It's no problem at all!"
315,20,2,Scott Malkinson,"I'm gonna do it! [Mr. Mackey turns a worried, then frustrated look] I'm gonna quit Twitter, I mean it this time!"
316,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Ohh, Scott, uh, I-it's sort of after hours, m'kay?"
317,20,2,Scott Malkinson,They all laugh at me. They won't be laughing when I do it! I'll show them!
318,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Hah, alright Scott. Come on inside. Huumm..."
319,20,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated. [Camera shows a hole and shovel in the ground] Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground."
320,20,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password?"
321,20,2,Eric Cartman,"I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box? [Cartman picks up his devices]"
322,20,2,Eric Cartman,You gotta unplug it and plug it back in. [Turning around] You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi...
323,20,2,Clyde Donovan,The girls are gonna do something drastic to us. We have to take matters into our own hands.
324,20,2,Eric Cartman,What are you...What are you guys talking about - What-
325,20,2,Stan Marsh,"You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry."
326,20,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online!"
327,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,Just put your stuff on the table and step back.
328,20,2,Eric Cartman,"Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please!"
329,20,2,Token Black,Let's just get it over with!
330,20,2,Eric Cartman,"No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't!"
331,20,2,Clyde Donovan,I can't listen to this!
332,20,2,Eric Cartman,"Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff!"
333,20,2,Craig Tucker,Let's just get it over with! [Walks up to Cartman]
334,20,2,Eric Cartman,"No please! If I can't get online, I won't-how would I-I- Mumbling."
335,20,2,Eric Cartman,"No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!!"
336,20,2,Eric Cartman,Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!
337,20,2,Stan Marsh,What have we done?
338,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,What we had to do.
339,20,2,Eric Cartman,[Off screen.] Iaahh!!
340,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Oh, Goddammit. You've got to be kidding me. [Sighs, then answers phone.] This is Counselor Mackey. What's going on Scott?"
341,20,2,Scott Malkinson,I swear to God I'm gonna do it this time.
342,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Okay Scott, just try to calm down. You don't want to quit Twitter."
343,20,2,Scott Malkinson,Why does it matter? People would be happier if I just did it!
344,20,2,Mr Mackey,"That's not true, no one would be happier. [Brings the phone away from his face.]"
345,20,2,Mr Mackey,"This fucking kid, oh my god... [Brings the phone back to his ear.] Everybody thinks you're a great kid, Scott."
346,20,2,Scott Malkinson,"I-I talked to my dad. He said, ""I don't have the guts to do it!"". Well, if I'd quit Twitter, he'd be sorry!"
347,20,2,Mr Mackey,"Okay, umm, how 'bout this, just umm, promise me you won't quit Twitter tonight, and we can - we can talk all day tomorrow, okay? M'kay?"
348,20,2,Scott Malkinson,I don't know if I'll make it through the night!
349,20,2,Mr Mackey,"[off phone] Oh, for fuck's sake..."
350,20,2,Scott Malkinson,"I just feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, you know, and being chased by hate. And the only way out is to jump!"
351,20,2,Mr Mackey,"[on phone] Uh-huh, okay, go on with that."
352,20,2,Scott Malkinson,"I keep thinking about what the kids at school would do, when they find out I left all my social media. Like they would finally see all the damage they've done."
353,20,2,Mr Mackey,"[off phone] Goddammit, just do it already..."
354,20,2,CNN Reporter,"Another internet troll is wreaking havoc on message boards, this time attacking a Danish website for women with breast cancer."
355,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,I made the news...
356,20,2,CNN Reporter,"The troll, who goes by the name ""SkankHunt42"", ..."
357,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,[He claps his hands.] Yes!
358,20,2,CNN Reporter,"...caused the website to temporarily shutdown. Danish Olympic Gold Medalist Freja Ollegard, who started the website, spoke out about the incident. [The inset video of Freja Ollegard zooms in.]"
359,20,2,Freja Ollegard,I am not shocked. I am not sad. I am not giving this pitiful person the satisfaction of being anything. [Gerald listens intently].
360,20,2,Freja Ollegard,This little troll can have his fun. I am going to be the bigger person. I am going to show the people of Denmark are not so easily broken down.
361,20,2,Gerald Broflovski,Hmm...Game on whore. Game on.
362,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,What's going on?
363,20,2,Stan Marsh,You didn't hear?
364,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,Hear what?
365,20,2,Stan Marsh,"The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night!"
366,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, that's impossible!"
367,20,2,Stan Marsh,It wasn't him Kyle! We took Cartman out for no reason. [Cartman walks past looking down] We can't undo what we've done.
368,20,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God. Oh my God...
369,20,2,Nelly,"The time has come. We said if the trolling didn't stop, there would be severe consequences. Get the word out to every girl in school. It goes down tomorrow!"
370,20,2,Wendy Testaburger,Oh my God...I don't know if I can go through with this.
371,20,2,Nichole Daniels,"We all have to be on-board Wendy. Every girl in school, or it means nothing."
372,20,2,Annie Knitts,"Don't forget what you said Wendy: ""For too long girls here have taken the backseat! Things have to change!"". Now they'll have to listen."
373,20,3,Simply Heidi,"We are back again with the brave Olympic gold medalist from Denmark, Freja Øllengård. Freja, you've talked about being trolled on the Internet and its consequences."
374,20,3,Freja Ollegard,"Yes, Heidi. I believe trolling has a tragic effect on innocent people."
375,20,3,Simply Heidi,"You have been the victim of horrific degrading attacks, spearheaded by a troll called [puts on her glasses] skankhunt42."
376,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"[watching on his computer, holding a glass of wine] Nice."
377,20,3,Freja Ollegard,"I've tried to just ignore the trolls, but that only seems to make them attack me more."
378,20,3,Simply Heidi,It must be so awful for you to create a Web site for women like yourself who are breat-cancer survivors and these... monsters get on and somehow make light of it. Even going as far as... ridiculing masdectomies.
379,20,3,Freja Ollegard,"Yes, it's very disgusting, but I still try very hard to believe in the goodness of humanity. [cheers from teh studio audience.]"
380,20,3,Simply Heidi,"I can tell you that the support for you on our Web site has been overwhelming. We'd like to share some comments we've received, many from doctors who believe your Web site is saving lives. The first is a comment from a physician in Spain: ""You go girl. You are doing great things. Don't let trolling stop you."" And that is from Dr. Juerdior Titsgo [Freja is alarmed at the name], in Spain."
381,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"[exults at his coup] He shoots, he scores! [Freya knows she's been trolled again and puts her face in her palm]"
382,20,3,Simply Heidi,"And there's this one: ""Believe in yourself and don't listen to the haters. You're an inspiration."" That's from Hungarian physician Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff."
383,20,3,Audience Member,Oh no...
384,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,HA! [throws an air ball] From the 3-point line!
385,20,3,Simply Heidi,"I'm sorry, am I missing something?"
386,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,Oh! Police! [sheepishly] Yes?
387,20,3,Officer,"Hello, sir, we're conducting an investigation."
388,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,Uh... regarding... uh regarding what?
389,20,3,Barkley and another officer,Do you happen to know this child? [shows him Cartman's picture from Photo Day]
390,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"[relieved] Hoooh. Sure, that's one of my son's friends."
391,20,3,Barkley and another officer,"Well, I'm afraid he's... quit Twitter."
392,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Hooo... another one, huh?"
393,20,3,Barkley and another officer,"Yeah, but this one's different. The events surrounding his quitting Twitter were very suspicious. Most people that quit Twitter leave at least three paragraphs stating that they're quitting Twitter before they quit Twitter. This child just stopped using it."
394,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,Kyle! [looks up the stairs]
395,20,3,Barkley and another officer,We're simply trying to gather information on whether this was a Twitter suicide or a Twitter homicide. [Kyle appears at the top of the stairs]
396,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, have you seen your friend Eric online?"
397,20,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[panics a bit] No. Uh, he quit."
398,20,3,Barkley and another officer,"D'ya happen to know why, son?"
399,20,3,Kyle Broflovski,He probably got fed up with all the negativity and decided to end it. [shrugs] I don't know.
400,20,3,Barkley and another officer,"Without tweeting a goodbye? People don't just quit social media. They post long drawn-out messages on social media, explaining why they're leaving social media."
401,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Look, officers, why don't you just go ask him why he quit Twitter?"
402,20,3,Barkley and another officer,"At where, sir? at where?"
403,20,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, that was the cops! The cops were here!"
404,20,3,Clyde,The cops? For what?
405,20,3,Token Black,"You know for what! You know what we did to Cartman! [he's video-chatting with the other boys on his computer, in several windows]"
406,20,3,Craig Tucker,We did what we had to do.
407,20,3,Kyle Broflovski,But we were wrong!
408,20,3,Butters Stotch,"[under his bed covers] It's not the police we have to worry about, it's Eric. He's gonna get us"
409,20,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey. W-we all just have to stay cool, okay?"
410,20,3,Butters Stotch,It doesn't matter. He's comin'. He's comin' to get us.
411,20,3,Randy Marsh,"Stan? [Stan's door is open, so Randy walks in] You can't just stay in your room all day."
412,20,3,Stan Marsh,"What happened, Dad? [Randy walks up to the bed] Everything's upside down. [Randy sits] Everyone's taking sides and splitting into groups. [thoughtfully] Everything sucks."
413,20,3,Randy Marsh,"[rubs the back of his neck] Yeah, everything sucks. [lowers his hand] Everyone's divided. Nobody's getting along. And there's people like your MOTHER who are thinking of voting for a DOUCHE because she doesn't have a BRAIN."
414,20,3,Sharon Marsh,"[off screen] Go to hell, Randy!"
415,20,3,Randy Marsh,I don't know what's wrong with people in this town. More and more are agreeing with your mother. I tried getting on community message boards and swaying people's minds but... it always ends up with some asshole talking about vaginas and photoshopping a dick in my mouth. That's where we're at today. Everything sucks.
416,20,3,Aide 1,"Here's everything to prepare you for the debates, ma'am. Just try and stay focused no matter what your opponent says."
417,20,3,Aide 2,"Don't let him rattle you. He's gonna do whatever he can to try and mess with your head. Bon't buy into it. Whatever he says, just respond with ""My opponennt is a liar, and he cannot be trusted."""
418,20,3,Hillary Clinton and two of her advisers.,Got it.
419,20,3,Announcer,"Decision 2016. The first Presidential debate, with moderator Lester Holt."
420,20,3,Lester Holt,"Okay, let's get right into it. Our first question is for you, sir. How will you deal with ground troops in Syria?"
421,20,3,Mr. Garrison,"Everyone, I need to just speak from the heart here. Uhm, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I've gotta come clean. Uh, I had no idea I would get this far, [Holt looks confused] but the fact of the matter is, I should not be President. Okay? [Clinton's aides watch from a back room] I will fuck this country up beyond repair. [Clinton's aides smile at this admission] I'm a sick, angry little man. Please, if you care at all about the future of our country, vote for her. Okay? She's the one who at least has some experience. She, she's not as bad as you think, I promise. And unlike me, she's actually capable of running this country."
422,20,3,Hillary Clinton and two of her advisers.,...My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted.
423,20,3,Aide 1,NOOO!
424,20,3,Aide 2,"Oh my God, she's such a turd sandwich."
425,20,3,Hillary Clinton and two of her advisers.,What he is saying is simply not true. Do not... believe it.
426,20,3,Mr. Garrison,"[throws his hands up and then faces Clinton] I am giving you this, lady. I AM GIVING you this! What the fuck are you doing?! [faces the audience again] Okay, look, look, just, vote for her, she... she knows politics. She really wants to put this country first."
427,20,3,Hillary Clinton and two of her advisers.,My opponent is a liar-
428,20,3,Mr. Garrison,Would you just please shut up?
429,20,3,Hillary Clinton and two of her advisers.,-And he cannot be-
430,20,3,Mr. Garrison,Get out of your own way.
431,20,3,Hillary Clinton and two of her advisers.,-cannot be trusted.
432,20,3,Mr. Garrison,"[in exasperation] Okay, okay, look. [stands up again] She doesn't mean what she's saying. She just doesn't know how to take this because... it's very weird and her advisers probably t-"
433,20,3,Hillary Clinton and two of her advisers.,"My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted. [as she says this, he throws his hands up and turns his back to the camera]"
434,20,3,Mr. Garrison,"Fuck, oh fuck, why the fuck does it have to be her? I am so fucked."
435,20,3,PC Principal,"Alright boys, I've had just about enough of playing games. [before him are Kyle, Stan, Butters, and Token] The four of you were good friends with Eric Cartman, and yet none of you seem to know why he left social media. [Butters fidgets a bit] Nobody's get anything to say? Well I have a theory. I think... that Eric Cartman... was somehow forced to leave social media as a retaliation for Heidi Turner quitting social media! Now, because of the actions of one sexist, bogoted, racist troll! [sweeps his hand across his desk and knocks a stack of papers to the floor]"
436,20,3,Butters Stotch,[lets out a] Eeeaaaahhhh!
437,20,3,PC Principal,"We have a gender war on our hands! Make no mistake, gentlemen! Our community is under attack! And if we don't get to the bottom of it... there's gonna be more students like Eric Cartman... wandering the hallways with no connection to the rest of the world."
438,20,3,Voice,[gruff whisper] Eric. [he looks up. By some exit doors is Heidi]
439,20,3,Eric Cartman,Heidi? Heidi Turner?
440,20,3,Heidi Turner,Come with me.
441,20,3,Eric Cartman,Where? [she turns and walks off to her left]
442,20,3,Heidi Turner,Join us. [points to a park] here.
443,20,3,Eric Cartman,The park?
444,20,3,Heidi Turner,"I know how you feel, Eric. I know how hard it is when school gets out. With no phone, no human contact."
445,20,3,Eric Cartman,[begins to cry] I miss my stuff.
446,20,3,Heidi Turner,Come on. There are others like us here. [guides him into the park. A car appears and slows down]
447,20,3,Driver and Martha,"Look at them, Martha. Do you see them?"
448,20,3,Driver and Martha,What are they?
449,20,3,Driver and Martha,Lost souls who have quit Twitter. Damned to just wander the earth and hang out and stuff.
450,20,3,Driver and Martha,They seem so lonely. [they both look at their phones]
451,20,3,Randy Marsh,"Okay, what?! The fuck?! Is wrong with you people?! I just saw a new poll that says more and more of you are thinking about voting for that douche!"
452,20,3,Stephen Stotch,"Some are. A lot of people like what he has to say, alright?"
453,20,3,Randy Marsh,"You're tellin' me that after that debate, you still wanna vote for that guy?!"
454,20,3,Stephen Stotch,More than ever.
455,20,3,Ryan Valmer,Yyyup.
456,20,3,Randy Marsh,Did you see the same debate I saw?!
457,20,3,Stephen Stotch,"Don't you get it, Randy? There's people in this country who are sick and tired. Tired of hearing all the rhetoric. Tired of Washington failing us while they pat their own backs. Finally someone comes along and says what he feels. That's why people like him. You can say what you want, at least he doesn't sound like another politician."
458,20,3,Mr. Garrison,"America, please listen to me. I have no idea how to be President. I am a complete jackass, and I have made a giant mistake here. [the crowd cheers his honesty, which stuns him] Nononono, nononono, why are you clapping? I'm not a good person for the White House. I am not a good person, period."
459,20,3,Man 2,"Finally, someone who doesn't talk like a politician."
460,20,3,Mr. Garrison,"I am peeing my pants... at the thought of being President, okay? [more cheers go up] No! Shut up! Listen to me! [the crowd quiets down] You don't want a guy like me in the White House! You don't even wanna know the shit I've done!"
461,20,3,Random Person,Wooohooo!
462,20,3,Mr. Garrison,I have scissored with another woman when I had a sex change!
463,20,3,Man 2,He's so honest!
464,20,3,Mr. Garrison,"No, no! I'm not the guy you want going to Russia to negotiate with Putin. I'll probably end up gettin' drunk and tryin' to suck his dick. [more cheering. He turns away from the mic] OHHHH JEEEZ"
465,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Ike, got a minute? [enters and sits on Ike's bed] Let's talk, buddy. [Ike pauses his game and goes to his bed] You know, the school really wants us to keep talking to our kids about trolling on the Internet and how serious it is. I guess the troll from the school message boards is now harassing a famous Olympic athlete from Denmark, heh. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah well, she kinda called him out and said he could never get her to quit social media, and you know, you might say she's askin' for it. But uh, now this troll is being copied by other trolls who are all dog piling to see if they can get her to quit and, well God only knows what they're gonna do tonight. Well, goodnight, pal. You be sure to let your mom know we talked more about the horrific consequences of trolling. [steps outside, then leans back and smiles at Ike, then leaves and closes the door]"
466,20,3,Heidi Turner,I want to tell you... that I'm sorry.
467,20,3,Eric Cartman,For what?
468,20,3,Heidi Turner,When women first started getting trolled on the school message boards. I was sure it was you. I was wrong.
469,20,3,Eric Cartman,You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.
470,20,3,Heidi Turner,"So when you held the assembly that woman were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?"
471,20,3,Eric Cartman,"[earnestly] Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind."
472,20,3,Heidi Turner,Do you miss your friends?
473,20,3,Eric Cartman,I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.
474,20,3,Heidi Turner,You do now. [smiles at him]
475,20,3,Eric Cartman,Kewl.
476,20,3,Newt Gingrich,Hello Florida! Please put your hands together and welcome the next President of the United States! [makes way for Mr. Garrison]
477,20,3,Mr. Garrison,I hate all of you so much.
478,20,3,Random Person,Yeah!
479,20,3,Mr. Garrison,I seriously hold so much contempt for each and every one of you pieces of shit. [cheers] If you vote me in as President I'll seriously throw up and have lost all faith in humanity. [more cheers]
480,20,3,Randy Marsh,[watching on TV] I agree.
481,20,3,Mr. Garrison,"I don't wanna be here. Please just let me go. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything. I'm scared. I'm completely clueless how to proceed. I just... spew bullshit and cry myself to sleep at night. Stop thinking that I'm anything more than a douche in over his head. For fuck's sake, please."
482,20,3,Randy Marsh,"Shit, I'm startin' to really like this guy."
483,20,3,CNN Anchor Paul,"And after stating that he was not fit to be President, Secretary Clinton responded with ""My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted."""
484,20,3,Patron,I am so confused.
485,20,3,CNN Anchor Paul,"In other news tonight, Danish gold medalist Freja Øllengård is the apparent victim of extreme trolling once again. [Gerald walks into the bar and watches the report]"
486,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh. Eh hey, can you turn that up?"
487,20,3,CNN Anchor Paul,The athlete from Denmark has been the target of relentless online attacks that began with the troll skankhunt42. [Gerald smiles and looks around to see if anyone has figured out it was him who's the troll] Last night the trolling took a vicious turn when Freja Øllengård finally succumbed to the pressure and committed suicide. [Gerald's smile vanishes.]
488,20,3,Field Reporter,"Paul, Danish women's volleyball champion Freja Øllengård has been pronounced dead outside her apartment in Copenhagen. [there's fear in Gerald's face] The four-time girls' medal winner took her own life after jumping 17 floors off the balcony of her building. [footage is shown of her doing this, with a klieg light focused on her all the way down. She lands on a car and shatters, blood going all over the place. The car's alarm turns on]"
489,20,3,CNN Anchor Paul,"Freja Øllengård, dead at the age of 38. [Quickly, Gerald runs to the restroom and into a stall. A patron watches him enter and continues doing so until the scene ends]"
490,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,[on the toilet seat] Oh my God! Oh shit! Oh shit oh my God! Oh God oh no-oohh!
491,20,3,Randy Marsh,"I was wrong, Stephen, I'm votin' for your guy."
492,20,3,Stephen Stotch,[surprised] What?
493,20,3,Randy Marsh,"It's just... [walks in] I see what you mean. He talks like an ordinary person. And he has a lot of the same emotions I do, you know? He's got my vote."
494,20,3,Stephen Stotch,Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
495,20,3,Randy Marsh,[turns around] What?
496,20,3,Stephen Stotch,You wanna vote for that douche?! He'll ruin this country!
497,20,3,Randy Marsh,You were just voting for him yesterday!
498,20,3,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah, but not anymore!"
499,20,3,Randy Marsh,What happened??
500,20,3,Stephen Stotch,I don't know.
501,20,3,Randy Marsh,What the hell is wrong with people?! You just don't flip back and forth like that?!
502,20,3,Stephen Stotch,You just did.
503,20,3,Randy Marsh,"[processes that reply] ...I did. What's going on, Stephen? Why does everything suck this hard?"
504,20,3,Stephen Stotch,I don't know. Nobody knows what to think anymore.
505,20,3,Randy Marsh,But how did we get here? Completely confused and with shit for choices? It's like... it's like there are other forces at work.
506,20,3,Stephen Stotch,"I'm just tired of thinkin' about it. Come on, let's relax and' have some member berry pie."
507,20,3,Randy Marsh,"[thinks a moment] Member berry pie... [drops the thought] Okay, I love member berries. [follows Stephen to the dining room table]"
508,20,3,Member Berries,"'Member Tattooine? 'Member the torture droid? I 'member? Hi, 'member Goonies? I loooved Goonies. 'Member Chunk? 'Member? 'Member the trash compactor? Oh, the trash compactor."
509,20,3,Randy Marsh,"[picks some berries up with a spoon, but stops] Wait a minute... [a camera pans away from the Stotch house into space, then moves east to Europe, then zooms in on Denmark.]"
510,20,3,Troll Hunter,"[in a Danish accent] Citizens of Denmark, we are under attack. As our ancestors did in days long ago, we must rise to defend our families. [Freja's casket is slowly brought to the altar outside the cathedral] A troll has come into our village and taken from us a beloved princess. He then returned to his secret hiding place, crawled back to his little cave, thinking the Danes would simply cry and run. [a mourner sobs] No. What this troll doesn't realize is that we have been planning our own attack. I'm announcing here and to the world that a plan to destroy the troll is underway. For in Denmark there is one thing we have known for centuries. To get the troll to come out of hiding, you must say its name."
511,20,3,Heidi Turner,Hey.
512,20,3,Eric Cartman,Hey. [long pause] I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.
513,20,3,Heidi Turner,Why is that?
514,20,3,Eric Cartman,"Because, black laughs matter."
515,20,3,Heidi Turner,...Is that a joke?
516,20,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, it is."
517,20,3,Heidi Turner,I don't get it.
518,20,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, you do. [Heidi just looks downward] Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?"
519,20,3,Heidi Turner,The hardest part is not having any followers. I used to go places just to show them where I was.
520,20,3,Eric Cartman,You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. [Heidi smiles]
521,20,3,Jud,Mornin'. How can I help ya?
522,20,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I have some questions about uh member berries?"
523,20,3,Jud,"Yeah'. Everyone wants member berries these days. [turns left and walks off] Right over heah. [Randy joins him] Don't know what makes them so popular. I've had to get rid of all mah pumpkins, mah onions and mah peppahs, just to make room for more membah berries. [the voices of member berries get louder as they approach the berry grove. There are berries as far as the eye can see.]"
524,20,3,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, there's this many?"
525,20,3,Member Berries,"'Member the 80s? Oh, 'member the 90s? Yeah yeah, but 'member the 80s though? Nonono, 'member the 90s?"
526,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Protocol Zero. No evidence, clear history. E-mails! delete, delete, delete, erase, erase, trash, trash. [reaches into his glove compartment and pulls out a hammer called ""Protocol Zero."" He leaves the car with phone and hammer in tow. An elderly woman draw near as he smashes the phone to bits on the roof of his car. Once he's destroyed the phone, he gets into his car and peels out. He rushes home and runs up to his office. He turns on his computer and begins to delete stuff in the Gerald folder he has on there. After that he opens up the computer and pulls out the hard drive. He takes the computer apart, puts it all in a duffel bag and drives to Stark's Pond, where he sets up a portable foot-operated catapult and launches the duffel bag into the pond. He quickly rushes home again and sites next to Sheila on the couch. Sheila just glances at him]"
527,20,3,Shelia,I saw Nancy Morris today. She has a different hair color. Again. I swear she doesn't think anyone even notices. Her natural hair color must be clear.
528,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,[rushed] Our computer's broke.
529,20,3,Shelia,...What?
530,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,It broke and I had to throw it away.
531,20,3,Shelia,"I thought if a computer isn't working, you try and get it fixed."
532,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,No now you just throw it away.
533,20,3,Shelia,You had all my recipes on that FileMaker program on your computer.
534,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"I'll get us a new computer tomorrow. Then I can see if we can pull your recipes up from Ike's computer, and that way we- Ike's computer! Shit! [runs upstairs]"
535,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Move move move! [pushes Ike out of the way and gets to work] My computer is off the network, and, and this computer didn't mirror that computer, but they did share the same Time Machine schedule, so then, would any of my files be accessible? No, because they didn't know each other's IP addresses. What if you can access my e-mail account from this computer through iCloud? If I go to iCloud, my e-mails are deleted. Good. Except there's a new e-mail. [It's from unknown] That shouldn't have come in. Why would an e-mail to me have come in if I deleted everything? [he reads the e-mail. It says the same thing the note did] ""I know who you are."" [spins around and points at Ike] You? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am, Ike?"
536,20,3,Ike Broflovski,"No, but I want to, Dad."
537,20,3,Gerald Broflovski,"[thinks of the Biblical sense] Not like that, smartass! [turns back to the computer and works on his account] Delete! Delete the account, not the e-mails! [gets an e-mail: ""You have a Google alert!"" He clicks OK and reads] ""meet me under the freemont bridge. 9 am tomorrow."" [panics] Oh God..."
538,20,3,Heidi Turner,You dip your French fries in the sweet & sour sauce?
539,20,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it."
540,20,3,Heidi Turner,"[tries it and eats] Wow, that's really good. I'm starting to feel like life isn't gonna be so bad."
541,20,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?"
542,20,3,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, of course."
543,20,3,Eric Cartman,Do girls... not have balls?
544,20,3,Heidi Turner,"Girls do not have balls, no"
545,20,3,Eric Cartman,"So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work? [she wonders why he's asking] I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina."
546,20,3,Heidi Turner,[munches on a fry] Do you want me to show you?
547,20,3,Eric Cartman,...Holy shiiit.
548,20,4,Narrator,"Long ago, in the deep and frozen lands of Scandinavia, there were creatures who wreaked havoc on humanity. [A troll is seen] The Troll. They dwell in rocks, in caves, isolated from civilization. The creatures were ugly, fat and slow-witted, but some could look and behave like human beings. These are the most dangerous. Now, the creatures have returned, this time, a thousand miles across the sea. [Earth is seen as it rotates. It zooms in on America, and an internet troll is seen] Today, the monsters believe they can go undetected, [Different trolls are seen] free to attack and then retreat to the darkness. But in Denmark, we have dealt with the trolls before, and now and now, we shall deal with them... again."
549,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, can I talk to you?"
550,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Sure, Kyle."
551,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"All the girls at school are really mad. It's like, one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us."
552,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,Uh huh.
553,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Everyone's sad, everyone's depressed and nobody knows how to move forward."
554,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,Good.
555,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I guess what I'm saying is, I'm starting to feel a lot of guilt, just for being a boy. How do I not feel that?"
556,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Sorry Kyle, I have to meet someone. Talk to your mother. [gets off the couch] I love you! [walks away]"
557,20,4,Butters Stotch,"It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now."
558,20,4,Charlotte,"Butters,I'm sorry, but I told you not to Skype me anymore, right?"
559,20,4,Butters Stotch,"[becomes shocked] But Baby, I love you!  I need you!  You can't break up with me!"
560,20,4,Charlotte,I have to stand with my girlfriends.
561,20,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you. [starts shouting] Those sneaky snakes in the grass!"
562,20,4,Charlotte,Who?!
563,20,4,Butters Stotch,"Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them!"
564,20,4,Charlotte,This is a time when women and girls have to stick together.
565,20,4,Butters Stotch,So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every [slams the keyboard] last one of you!
566,20,4,Charlotte,[ends the call]
567,20,4,Butters Stotch,Oh Charlotte? [presses on the mouse] Are you there? [presses on the mouse] Honey?
568,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[takes off his sunglasses] I don't know why you are harassing me. I don't even own a computer.
569,20,4,Dick,My name is Dick.
570,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,Are you with the NSA or Homeland Security?
571,20,4,Dick,No! I'm a colleague.
572,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,A colleague?
573,20,4,Dick,"You probably know me as ""Dildo Shwaggins""."
574,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,Dildo Shwaggins from Pussystores.org?!
575,20,4,Dick,We need to talk.
576,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"You're just a troll?! [turns to his left, raises his arms, and looks up] Oh thank god!"
577,20,4,Dick,"We're on the same team, Skankhunt."
578,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[lowers his hand] Wait, but that means I went ""Protocol Zero"" for nothing. Oh shit [throws his cup of coffee]!"
579,20,4,Dick,"What's ""Protocol Zero""?"
580,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[circles around and then sits] Everything's gone! I destroyed my computers, my phone! [looks at Dick] Why couldn't you just say, ""I know who you are. I'm a troll too,""? Why do you have to be so fucking cryptic?!"
581,20,4,Dick,Us trolls have to be careful.  You know that.
582,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Look, I'm not really a troll, okay? I just started as a Yelp reviewer and got sick of how everyone's stupid comments sounded.  I just like messing with people 'cause it was funny. I got carried away!"
583,20,4,Dick,"These are really dangerous times, Skankhunt. There are there are things happening in the world and trolls have to come together."
584,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,For what?
585,20,4,Dick,Someone is trying to wipe us out! Our way of life is in danger.
586,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,It's not a way of life! I was just doing it for the LOLs.
587,20,4,Dick,That's not true. I've studied your work. You're one of the best trolls I have ever seen.
588,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[stands up] No, no! I am done with this crap. I thought my wife was going to find out, [grabs his sunglasses] but that was too spooky. [puts on his sunglasses and walks away]."
589,20,4,Dick,"Gerald, we need each other. The Danish [raises his arms] are planning something horrible against us."
590,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[stops and faces Dick] I'm not one of you, okay? I just need to stop. [tries to climb up the steep dirt, but falls down]."
591,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[talks while pacing back and forth] Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot and ... we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them. There's a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support."
592,20,4,Stan Marsh,You really think that's gonna make a difference?
593,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,I do. We need to show the girls that not all boys aren't the same and that we are willing to change. [stops pacing]
594,20,4,Butters Stotch,"Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle? [talks while walking] All I've been hearing in a few weeks is how [stops walking]this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right!"
595,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,Butters?
596,20,4,Butters Stotch,"[turns towards and points at him] This is a war [walks from Kyle] on all of us. You want to listen to Uncle Kyle, we'll go ahead. Pretty soon [stops walking, and faces Tweek and Craig] they'll be locking us all up. And don't think you're safe either, Tweek and Craig. Just 'cause you're gay does not mean that you aren't looked down upon for being boys! [turns to his left] The world wants us all to feel shame just because we were all born with [points downwards] wieners!"
597,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, you need to calm down."
598,20,4,Butters Stotch,"No! [walks towards Kyle] We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us?"
599,20,4,Clyde Donovan,Nowhere.
600,20,4,Butters Stotch,"[turns around] Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours!"
601,20,4,Token,That's true!
602,20,4,Butters Stotch,"I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind, [points at Kyle] or are you with Uncle Kyle."
603,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, you've been sitting at the table for three hours now. You okay?"
604,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[stops tapping] I'm great! Totally good. Just sitting down and ... doing nothing. Is there a problem with that? Is there a problem with just wanting to sit and just be? Is that illegal now?
605,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Not at all, Gerald. I'm sorry."
606,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"I'm totally happy. I'm happy. I don't need to do anything to make me happy, fuck."
607,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Well! I know you said your computer was broken. So, I went ahead and got you something. [takes out iPad from a bag] Here, it's your own iPad."
608,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[gets frightened, stands up and tries walking away from Sheila] Ah! Ah ah, ah! No, no! I'm good. Get that away from me."
609,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,[turns to her husband] You don't like it?
610,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"No, sorry! I love it! I'm just swearing off electronics for a little bit. [leans closer to the iPad and speaks softer in a harsh tone] Or maybe I can just get on a couple of message boards. [backs away and speaks normally] No, I'm good! I don't need it!"
611,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, [walks closer to Gerald] what's going on?"
612,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Nothing, Sheila. I'm fine. [turns so his body faces the table] I'm just trying to make some changes and less electronics is part of it. I'm sorry, Honey. Everything is okay. Promise."
613,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Okay, Gerald. I'll make us some lunch. [walks to the kitchen] Oh uh, did that guy outside talk to you?"
614,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[faces the front window] What guy outside? [walks towards the window and sees Dick on the other side of the road from his house] What the fuck? [checks on Sheila and then whispers to Dick] Go away, go! [waves his arms sideways] Go! Go away! Go go!"
615,20,4,Dick,"[shows a note to Gerald that says ""WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK"", then drops the paper to show the other note saying ""IT'S IMPORTANT""]"
616,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[whispers quickly, closes the blind and curtains of the window, and then walks away]"
617,20,4,Sports Commentator,Welcome students and parents to tonight's matchup between the South Park Cows and the Bona Festa Demons.
618,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this is awesome! Did you see how many of the boys I've got to come out tonight?!"
619,20,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah! This is a pretty sweet turnout!
620,20,4,Wendy,[smiles at Stan]
621,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,This is exactly what we needed. Thank god people listen to me.
622,20,4,Referee,[blows whistle]
623,20,4,Sports Commentator,"And now please sit, stand, or kneel for the National Anthem."
624,20,4,Butters Stotch,"[takes off his pants and underwear, pulls his shirt, and raises his fist causing people to be shocked]"
625,20,4,Jason,"Holy crap, dude. Look at Butters."
626,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,Oh [hits his face] no!
627,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[walks through town depressed and then quickly dodges a bicyclist] Son a bitch! Ahhh! [walks near the Community Center, reads a sign about addiction problems, and checks the group]"
628,20,4,Randy Marsh,"Gerald. Hey come on in. You're not alone, bud. We're all facing the same struggles and trying to do something about it. Anyways please continue, Richard."
629,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[sits on the available chair to the right of Randy]
630,20,4,Richard,"Well like I was saying, I've been addicted to memberberries for the past two months now."
631,20,4,Randy Marsh,"It's okay, man. You're not alone."
632,20,4,Richard,"It's just, you know, 'membering is more fun than thinking. I want so bad to go back to when things were good. When I was a kid, you know like, the 80s and the 90s, and things made sense."
633,20,4,Randy Marsh,And that's how we got here to this very memberberry election.
634,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,What is this?!
635,20,4,Randy Marsh,"What have been your struggles with memberberries, Gerald?"
636,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"I, I don't even know what a member--."
637,20,4,Berries,"[muffled from Michael's pocket] 'Member the Dagobah? Yeah, I remember the Dagobah. That's where Yoda lives. 'Member Yoda?! Oh, I 'member!"
638,20,4,Randy Marsh,"[coughs] Michael, are there memberberries in your pocket?"
639,20,4,Berries,"Oh, 'member Corellian Corvette?! I remember Corellian Corvette!"
640,20,4,Michael,[sqishes the memberberries] Nope!
641,20,4,Randy Marsh,"Anyway, Gerald, what has your experience been?"
642,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,I don't even know what memberberries are.
643,20,4,Stephen,"Gerald, come on. The first step towards healing is admitting you've got a problem."
644,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah. [stands up and points at Stephen] Well you've got a fat pussy, and you should go and fucking kill yourself! [calms down] Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place. [walks away]"
645,20,4,PC Principal,"Make no mistake! I want to be very upset. However, as a community, we have all decided that people have the right to protest the National Anthem."
646,20,4,Wendy,They took their wieners out!
647,20,4,PC Principal,[points upwards] Correct! [lowers his arms] But they did so peacefully and without malice towards others.
648,20,4,Wendy,This was an attack on us. This is exactly why we sat out the National Anthem in the first place!
649,20,4,PC Principal,"I want you to understand something, ladies. [positions his hands parallel from each other] I am in a PC Pretzel here because if I say [moves his hands to his right] they can't protest even though [moves his hands to the left of him] you protested [moves his hand back towards the middle] and the only difference is that their protest included physical gestures, then I'm body shaming!"
650,20,4,Bebe,So you're just gonna let the boys take their wieners out whenever they want?
651,20,4,PC Principal,That's what happens when you sit out the National Anthem.
652,20,4,Butters Stotch,[speaks through a microphone while rallying a group of boys with their pants pulled out] We walk together in peace! We walk together in peace! We're not poor for feeling ashamed in who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out!
653,20,4,Wieners Out Boys expect Butters,Wieners out!
654,20,4,Butters Stotch,"Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow nice because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing!"
655,20,4,Wieners Out Boys expect Butters,Yeah!
656,20,4,Butters Stotch,"What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry!"
657,20,4,Wendy,[runs away from the rally]
658,20,4,Wieners Out Boys expect Butters,Wieners out!
659,20,4,Butters Stotch,Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are!
660,20,4,Stan Marsh,[pulls down his pants and joins the rally]
661,20,4,Butters Stotch,You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple!
662,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[whispers] Damn it! [waves his arms away from the window] I live here! Stop that! [shuts the curtains and lies on the bed next to Sheila]
663,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,[stops reading and faces Gerald] You don't have to work tonight?
664,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"No, nothing!"
665,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,Wow! I don't remember the last time you were able to get in bed the same time as me.
666,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,Got all caught up with work!
667,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Hey, I'm not complaining. [closes her book] It feels good to have you here."
668,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[gets off the bed and runs away] I'm going on a run!
669,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[gets surprised by the car honking at him] Ah! [raises his fist] Fuck you! [""flips"" his index fingers] Fuck you!"
670,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[talks from the master bathroom] Yeah!
671,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,[fully wakes up]
672,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Screw you, Skank! You fat little bitch! Go kill yourself, whore!"
673,20,4,Shiela,[gets off bed and walks near the master bathroom].
674,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, fuck you, bitch! Fuck you! [chuckles]"
675,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald? [opens the door, gets scared of the Gerald's creepy face, screams, and runs away]"
676,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[lays iPad in the sink and chases Sheila] Oh, sorry, Hun! Sorry!"
677,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Everyone all right, guys?"
678,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Everything's fine, Kyle. Go back to bed."
679,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"[wipes her eyes with tissue] One night you, you say all of our computer stuff is broken and you, you hide everything and then you show up with all of this new equipment and now this! Please, tell me what's going on!"
680,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,Nothing is going on!
681,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"[points at Gerald] You hissed at me! You went [faces to her right, hisses, and then faces back at him]."
682,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, okay. I'm going to tell you the truth, Sheila. I watch porn on the Internet. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop."
683,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"But I know you watch porn. You told me you watched porn and I told you that I don't care, Gerald."
684,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh yeah! But uh, it's uh, but this is different."
685,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,Why?! Because it's not normal porn?
686,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,Right!
687,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,Like something really embarrassing?
688,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,It's really embarrassing.
689,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,Tell me!
690,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"It's... porn! It's... uh, piss! Porn! Piss porn!"
691,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,Piss porn? Like people peeing on each other?
692,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[stands up] See?! [walks closer to Sheila] It's so embarrassing! No wonder I hid it, right?! [wipes his forehead] Whew! [moves closer to Sheila] I'm sorry! It's good to get it out in the open though. [walks to bed]"
693,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,Do you want me to pee on you?
694,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[stops and turns around] No!
695,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,You only like watching other women pee?
696,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[walks closer to Sheila] Oh no, no! It's not like that."
697,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,[turns around] Because they're pretty? You have to watch around a video because I'm overweight and old?
698,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"No! I, I, I want you to! I just couldn't ask."
699,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"You do, promise? [faces Gerald]"
700,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[in complete shock] Yes?
701,20,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Am I doing it right, Gerald?"
702,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,Yep! [gnarls]
703,20,4,Ike,[watches Gerald and Sheila from the hallway]
704,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"So hot, I mean [gnarls] warm! [gnarls some more]"
705,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,[walks behind Ike and gets shocked by Gerald and Sheila's actions]
706,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi, Cartman."
707,20,4,Eric Cartman,"[looks at Kyle] Hey, Kyle."
708,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm so sorry, what we did to you. This Internet troll has everyone going crazy. We shouldn't have assumed it was you. We shouldn't have broke all of your stuff."
709,20,4,Eric Cartman,Cool. That's cool.
710,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,No! I know it's not cool. I know you're figuring out how to get back at us.
711,20,4,Eric Cartman,"I saw a vagina, Kyle."
712,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
713,20,4,Eric Cartman,I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose.
714,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,You saw who's vagina?
715,20,4,Eric Cartman,"My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite."
716,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[lays his hand on his forehead] Yeah right, okay. [lowers his hand] I'm being serious, Cartman. Butters needs to be taken down a notch and you're the best at that."
717,20,4,Heidi Turner,"[overlaps Kyle's last few words and approaches Eric] Eric, hey! I got us both chocolate milks."
718,20,4,Eric Cartman,[stands up and talks to Heidi] Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you.
719,20,4,Heidi Turner,The pink and blue one?!
720,20,4,Eric Cartman,That's what my baby wanted.
721,20,4,Heidi Turner,"[raises her arms and cheers] Yay, [lowers her arms] put it on me!"
722,20,4,Eric Cartman,"[puts the necklace on Heidi and faces Kyle] Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle?"
723,20,4,Heidi Turner,"[faces Kyle] Oh yeah. Hey, Kyle. [talks to Eric while they hold hands] The show's on at five tonight if you want to watch it at your house or my house."
724,20,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um. [talks to Kyle] Go ahead, Kyle."
725,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[in complete shock] The, the school is in trouble and, um our friends are..."
726,20,4,Eric Cartman,He said something about us working together to take down Butters.
727,20,4,Heidi Turner,"Why? What's going on, Boo?"
728,20,4,Eric Cartman,"I'm not sure, Boo. [faces Kyle] Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? [faces Heidi] Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out."
729,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,[pauses in complete shock]
730,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"It wasn't suppose to be like this. I just thought it was funny making people get wild up. It was just stupid-harmless-lock-room humor, till I made that lady kill herself."
731,20,4,Dick,"[sighs] You can't deny who you are, Skankhunt."
732,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[speaks softer and faces Dick] Don't call me that here! Why can't you just go away?!
733,20,4,Dick,Because we're all in danger. Didn't you see the video I sent you?
734,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"No! Don't you get it?! I went ""Protocol Zero""! I broke my phone, I delete all my email accounts so that nobody can trace me [faces away from the bench] ever again!"
735,20,4,Dick,"They will be able to, [faces Gerald] everyone. You need to see this video, Skankhunt. The whole world is about to change."
736,20,4,Eric Cartman,"[talks to Kyle] You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like ""Women aren't funny,"" even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met."
737,20,4,Heidi Turner,Shut up.
738,20,4,Eric Cartman,"[talks to Heidi] No, it's true. Get over yourself."
739,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,[starts to get bored]
740,20,4,Heidi Turner,I don't even try to be funny.
741,20,4,Eric Cartman,I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.
742,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, will you just help me mess with Butters to stop his little agroclub from getting any bigger?"
743,20,4,Eric Cartman,"[talks to Kyle] Like mess with Butters how? [lifts mug] What do you mean ""mess with Butters""? [drinks from mug]"
744,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,You know what I mean. Come on! We need the old Cartman back!
745,20,4,Eric Cartman,[gets mad] Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi.
746,20,4,Heidi Turner,What?
747,20,4,Eric Cartman,You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.
748,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's not true at all!
749,20,4,Eric Cartman,"[talks sarcastically] Oh she's not funnier than you, [speaks with anger] or is she just not funny because she's a girl?"
750,20,4,Heidi Turner,"Babe, stop. I don't think he meant anything by it."
751,20,4,Eric Cartman,"[talks to Heidi] Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers."
752,20,4,Heidi Turner,"[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, I think it's great you're trying to patch things up with everyone, but the truth is Eric and I are just kind of out of it now."
753,20,4,Eric Cartman,"[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now."
754,20,4,Heidi Turner,We gave up social media and the ugliness that goes along with it and we're in a better place.
755,20,4,Eric Cartman,Humans on Mars.
756,20,4,Dick,"I'm warning you, Skankhunt, [takes out his laptop and types] this video is really gonna rock your world."
757,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,"[talks softer] Can you please call me ""Gerald""?!"
758,20,4,Dick,"[gives Gerald his laptop] It's very obscure news story from the BBC in England. Hardly anyone has seen it over here. [presses a button and faces away from the bench] This is why we all have to come together, Skank."
759,20,4,BBC Reporter,"Since the dawn of the Internet, message boards and chat rooms have lit up with people who insight and insult for no apparent reason. They're called [picture of guy with an actual troll behind him is shown] trolls, and a controversial company in Denmark is working to make them a thing of the pass. ""The days of trolls hiding behind nicknames and message boards are over!"" the Danish claim. [Danish music is played] As a new website, [Troll Trace headquarters is shown] Trolltrace.com will soon be up and running. In less than a month, the servers will become active. Anyone can take any troll comment and send it through the Danish service where a real name and real physical address will be attached."
760,20,4,Bedrager,"[World spinning with the word ""STIMULATION"" is shown] Every message, every comment [comment is scan, world stops spinning, and a tracer is shown] ever made by trolls will retroactively be given a tag [troll's true identity is shown] with the author's name, location, and [police barge into the troll's house] whole Internet history."
761,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[in complete shock] Fffffuuuuuccckkk!
762,20,4,Dick,I told you.
763,20,4,BBC Reporter,And this is the man who has masterminded it all.
764,20,4,Bedrager,"What this will allow people to do is trace back harmful and hateful postings or emails. You see, the troll hides behind a protective layer if you will that Internet enmity provides. We intend to strip them of that protection so that everyone will know who they are."
765,20,4,BBC Reporter,And what about people who will use this to spy on others who aren't trolls?
766,20,4,Bedrager,"Uh, what do you mean?"
767,20,4,BBC Reporter,"Once your servers become active, anyone can trace anything onto the Internet back to whoever wrote it. How do you stop that from happening?"
768,20,4,Bedrager,"Oh oh, right. [coughs and faces the camera] This service is only for tracing the identity of trolls. Thank you. Kom ud trold, komme ud og dø."
769,20,4,Dick,"I Google Translated the last part. He said ""Come out troll, come out and die""."
770,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,This can't be happening.
771,20,4,Dick,"By next week, everything everyone has ever done online is going to be available to the public."
772,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,[closes laptop] Then it's over. I'm dead.
773,20,4,Dick,"[faces Gerald] You're not dead, Skankhunt. There's still hope."
774,20,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[shouts] Everyone, can I have your attention please?! [everyone has his attention] I know the past few weeks have been very difficult, for all of us. I know now more than ever that something has to change. I thought a lot about this the past few days. I've seen a lot of things I never thought I would have see. These are all complex issues we're all having to face, and now that I know that after you break it down, there's really only one answer. [pulls off his pants, holds his shirt, and raises his arm]"
775,20,4,Boys,"Yeah! [one of them says ""That's right."" as they all gradually pull off their pants]"
776,20,4,Butters Stotch,"Good for you, Uncle Kyle!"
777,20,4,Dick,"[takes off the bandana and crumples it in his shirt] Fellow trolls, let me introduce you to Skankhunt42."
778,20,4,Gerald Broflovski,I'm not necessarily Skankhunt42.
779,20,4,Troll 1,"It's okay, Skank. You're with your kind."
780,20,5,Jason,Hit her!
781,20,5,Random Boy,"Hit her, man!"
782,20,5,Annie Knitts,"Kick his ass, Nelly!"
783,20,5,Red,All boys should die!
784,20,5,Lola,Take him out!
785,20,5,Nelly,"I don't care if you're a boy, I'm gonna kick your ass!"
786,20,5,Butters Stotch,"[is seen with his pants put down and shirt pulled up] Anytime anywhere, skank."
787,20,5,Boys except Butters,Yeah!
788,20,5,Boys except Butters,Yeah!
789,20,5,Nelly,Pull up your stupid pants first.
790,20,5,Butters Stotch,Why? You're afraid to fight me like a man?
791,20,5,Clyde Donovan,"Kick her ass, Butters. She called you stupid."
792,20,5,Wendy Testaburger,He is stupid! Look at him!
793,20,5,Jimmy Valmer,At least he's not a zzzzitty-faced ggirl.
794,20,5,Boys expect Butters and Jimmy,Yeah!
795,20,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks from the girls side of the fight to the in between Nelly and Butters and spreads his arms] Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys! [crowd stops yelling] Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl?"
796,20,5,Annie Knitts,"Get out of here, Cartman; nobody's buying it."
797,20,5,Red,"Yeah, everyone knows you're the worst!"
798,20,5,Heidi Turner,"Hey, leave him alone! [walks from the boys side of the fight to near Cartman] Eric tries to help [spreads her arms] and you call him names?! [talks to Cartman] Sorry, babe, I had to step in."
799,20,5,Eric Cartman,"It's cool, Baby."
800,20,5,,[Heidi and Cartman kiss each other and causing the others to be flabbergasted]
801,20,5,Wendy Testaburger,Heidi?!
802,20,5,Annie Knitts,[faints]
803,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl."
804,20,5,Advisor 1,"All right sir [gives Garrison his lines], don't be nervous for your speech; I know we're down a bit in the polls, but there's still a great chance we can win the Swing States."
805,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"There's [flips through pages] still a chance, are you serious?!"
806,20,5,Publicist 1,"Just one thing sir, be a little careful of what you say about women. Uh, seems like that might be losing us some votes. [walks away]"
807,20,5,Herbert Garrison,[puts his hand under his chin] Oh you don't say?
808,20,5,Chris Christie,"Ladies and gentlemen, out country's divided like never before. And we all know that only one man has the guts to say what we're all thinking. Please, welcome the man who with your help will soon be the next President of the United States! [Mr. Garrison comes out to great fanfare and takes the mic.]"
809,20,5,Crowd Members,Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! [somewhere in there a man shrieks. Garrison lights up a cigarette and starts pacing]
810,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"So I'm standin' in line at the airport, waitin' in security 'cause of all the freakin' Muslims. [cheers and applause]"
811,20,5,Supporter,Ow!
812,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"And the TSA security people all look like black thugs from the inner city; I'm like ""Oh good, you're gonna protect us?"" [laughter] Well maybe it's good they're all gang members. At least they can tell the difference between Muslims and Mexicans, 'cause God knows I can't. [applause] You know, I'm standin' there in line and you know what I do? I stick my finger in this chick's asshole, [applause and laughter] and she turns to me and says, ""Hey, aren't you that guy that's running for President?"" I say Yeah. She says ""Why you got your finger in my ass?"" I say ""I'm just keeping it warm, honey, 'cause that chick next to you is way hotter and I'm gonna stick it in her clam."" [the men are clapping, the women just look at him now] Yeah, let's make America great again. No dude wants his finger in some ugly bitch's ass. [the men laugh] You gotta be careful though, it's only about half an inch away, you know, that asshole and that clam, so you gotta be careful. Right dudes? [A woman gets up and makes her way to the aisle] Oh. Oh, where are you goin'? Are you leavin? [the woman turns right to leave the rally] I'm sorry, did I offend you? Where did I lose you, honey? You've been okay with the ""fuck everyone to death,"" all the Muslim and Mexican shit, but fingers in the ass did it for ya? [she reaches the door and exits] Cool, just wanted to see where your line was! [some more women get up, one of them leaves with her husband] Oh yeah, look, I guess some more broads are leavin'. Oh Jeez you were so on board, I can't believe I let that little offensive mark slip. Poor girls. Did you get your feelings hurt after ""Fuck all the immigrants"" and?"" Jeez, I'm sorry. Jeez."
813,20,5,Bedrager,"[in a weird accent] Hello. Are you tired of hate speech? Are you sick of sexism and-a bigotry? Then please, help the Danish put an end to trolls."
814,20,5,Danes,Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
815,20,5,Bedrager,"Right now, the people of Denmark are working on a biometric computer superstructure which will allow people all around the world to identify the trolls in their communities."
816,20,5,Danes,Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
817,20,5,Bedrager,"But to make this dream into a reality, we still need your donations. We are just a few million kroners away, so please donate via the social media of your choice."
818,20,5,Danes,[four windows open and some Danes sing out] Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
819,20,5,Bedrager,"Just imagine it, knowing who said what on the Internet."
820,20,5,Dane 1,The whole world will be-a peaceful and happy.
821,20,5,Dane 2,"Like-a here, in Denmark."
822,20,5,Dane 3,Help fund our project on social media today!
823,20,5,Danes,"Together, we will rid the world of trolls. Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang tjing nutillej!"
824,20,5,Dick,"Fellow trolls, we have gathered together because our anonymity is being threatened. Individually, we are some of the most notorious trolls in Colorado. We must now find a way to unite. Each one of us has the power to make message boards go haywire, The power to make individuals buckle and fall. Imagine if we use those skills against a common enemy."
825,20,5,Troll 2,They have an entire government at their disposal.
826,20,5,Dick,And we... have Skankhunt42.
827,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,[sighs] It's Gerald. Alright?
828,20,5,Dick,I believe that he... is the key to stopping all this.
829,20,5,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. This school is falling apart, and it needs to stop. Boys are harassing girls, and girls are stereotyping boys as- Not now, Mr. Stotch! Put it away!"
830,20,5,Butters Stotch,[with his pants down and dick out] Well okay. [pulls his pants back up.]
831,20,5,PC Principal,"Now I've asked for some ideas and a couple of students wanna try and help. Please welcome Heidi and Eric. [they come up wearing matching shirts: ""COME TOGETHER as a school""]"
832,20,5,Eric Cartman,Hey you guys?
833,20,5,Heidi Turner,What's up? [the other kids stay silent]
834,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny."
835,20,5,Heidi Turner,"Eheh, stop, Eric."
836,20,5,Eric Cartman,"You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby."
837,20,5,Heidi Turner,"Thanks, babe. I don't know if you guys have heard, but right now, Denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past. They're asking for help, and I thought ""why not a school fundraiser?"""
838,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?"
839,20,5,Heidi Turner,What? How did I say it? [from here their voices get softer and softer until they're whispering to each other]
840,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Remember, you were like ""Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?"" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh-"
841,20,5,Heidi Turner,When was this? Were we at Denny's?
842,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?"
843,20,5,Heidi Turner,"[giggling] Oh, and you kept spilling it and everything?"
844,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it"
845,20,5,Heidi Turner,He had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head.
846,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that..."
847,20,5,Heidi Turner,Then we should all come together [mimicking Cartman] as a skewl. [Cartman giggles and sighs happily. Bebe throws up involuntarily]
848,20,5,Advisor 1,"Sir, what were you thinking? We said to be careful how you talked about women."
849,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"[satisfied with himself] Yeah I don't know, I guess I just kind of screwed the pooch on that one. [checks for any Pabst Blue Ribbon cans with beer left in them]"
850,20,5,Chris Christie,We are way down in the polls. I don't know how we recover from this.
851,20,5,Herbert Garrison,Oh really? Jeez that's too bad. [dusts off his pants and checks his shoes]
852,20,5,Chris Christie,A lot of us have staked our lives on backing you! You can't just go bonkers like this!
853,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Hey, sorry. I didn't realize women were racists."
854,20,5,Advisor 2,You have... millions of supporters who are looking to you to lead! They're gonna wanna know what you're gonna do about this!
855,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"I mean, I don't know. Nothin'. Whatever."
856,20,5,Chris Christie,You wanna tell them that? They're outside. [Garrison is horrified.]
857,20,5,Supporter 1,What's goin' on?!
858,20,5,Supporter 2,What are ya doin?!
859,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"[steps outside] Oh, uh hey everybody. Uh, looks like we're tanking in the polls, but you know what? It's fixed. I was never gonna win in the first place. I knew it from the beginning. And on November 8th, when I lose, I'll be able to say ""I told you so!"" [grins. The crowd is not amused.]"
860,20,5,Supporter 2,This son of a bitch pulled a fast one on us!
861,20,5,Supporter 3,It's like he's not even trying!
862,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Oh no, I'm I'm trying. I just-"
863,20,5,Supporter 2,Get him!
864,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Shiiit! [he runs off, and the crowd gives chase] Ohhh Jeeez! [people in the crowd come armed with shovels, pitchforks, bats, axes, knives, guns... One person even has a chainsaw he has trouble starting up.]"
865,20,5,Supporters,Kill him! Tear his head off! Don't let him get away!
866,20,5,Supporter 4,[ginally gets that chainsaw going] Yeah haw!
867,20,5,Andrew,[knocks on the door]
868,20,5,Anonymous821,What do you want? Go away.
869,20,5,Andrew,"Hey, just checking to see if you needed any more refreshments for the conference room?"
870,20,5,Anyomous821,We're fine. We don't need anything.
871,20,5,A Troll,[within the room] Some more creamer?
872,20,5,Anonymous821,Just some more creamer.
873,20,5,Andrew,"Alright, well, I just wanna say ""thanks for choosing the-"" [the troll shuts the door]"
874,20,5,Anonymous821,"Okay, we're clear again."
875,20,5,Dick,"You were saying, Skankhunt?"
876,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Alright, look. How do you troll somebody?"
877,20,5,Troll 4,Say really fucked up shit and make them quit social media?
878,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh."
879,20,5,Anonymous821,Wow... that seems kind of... mean.
880,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,It's not mean if it's hilarious.
881,20,5,Dick,"If we all worked with you, Skank, could we do it? Could we troll an entire country?"
882,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,If we all worked together? Maybe. [makes a fist with his left hand] Maybe.
883,20,5,Heidi Turner,"Hey guys. Today we're gonna start our school fundraiser. It's an idea I came up with called ""Danishes for Denmark."""
884,20,5,Eric Cartman,[almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome.
885,20,5,Heidi Turner,"We need everyone to do their part, so later on in the cafeteria, we are all gonna need to- [the classroom door opens and Heidi looks to see who opened it. Mr. Garrison rushes in and gets to work immediately]"
886,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"[frantic] Okay children, let's take our seats! Let's uh, get back to our lessons on grammar, shall we?"
887,20,5,Stan Marsh,Mr. Garrison?
888,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Okay, does anybody, uh, remember where we left off? No? Alright, uh, who can tell me what an adjective is? [to Mrs. Nelson] You can go now, I'm back. [to the class] Who can t-who can tell me what an adjective is?"
889,20,5,Token Black,"Uh, aren't you running for President?"
890,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Adjectives usually come before what? They come before nouns, that's right."
891,20,5,Chris Christie,"[clears his throat] Mr. Garrison, you can't just act like nothing happened! You're spiraling out of control, and you have to answer to the people!"
892,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"I don't know what you're talking about! I am a teacher! [back to the board] Okay, adjectives describe nouns, and there are several types of them-"
893,20,5,Chris Christie,Mr. Garrison.
894,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"What are some examples of adjectives you can give me for this sentence? Anybody? [writes ""Jack threw the  ball."" on the board.]"
895,20,5,Chris Christie,"You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison, and you have to make good on it!"
896,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"The yellow ball. That's a good one. Or we can say ""the slippery ball,"" can't we?"
897,20,5,Chris Christie,Come on. [his advisers come in.]
898,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"What else about the ball? No, please! [The advisers gather around him and carry him off] What else can we say about the ball, children? No, please! Leave me alone!"
899,20,5,Butters Stotch,The bouncy ball?
900,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"[grabs a chalk stick and scratches it against the blackboard] No! No, I'm not going back! Please! They're gonna kill me, children! Please! Help me, children! Help me! [Chris Christie shuts the door]"
901,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, come on. Office is upstairs. [they run into Sheila] Oh, hi honey."
902,20,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, you're back from your convention?"
903,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up."
904,20,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, can I make you guys somethin' to eat?"
905,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much! [he and Dick go on upstairs.] Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins."
906,20,5,Dick,Hello. [Gerald closes the door]
907,20,5,Dick,"I gotta hand it to you, Gerald. You have a really nice home, nice family."
908,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am.
909,20,5,Dick,And who is that?
910,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,What?
911,20,5,Dick,I've studied your work. You're so good at lashing out at the system. Bringing people down off their high horses. Why do you do it?
912,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz."
913,20,5,Dick,"I don't believe that. I think there's more to Skankhunt. When I was in school, kids teased me. Called me ""midget,"" even though I'm not. My mother was a little person, but she actually married a guy who had gigantism syndrome. She thought, if she was a little person and had a baby with a giant, I would come out normal. [Gerald stifles a laugh] We can't let these Danish pricks take our online lives, Skank. For some of us... it's all we have."
914,20,5,Heidi and Cartman,Let's come together as a skewl.
915,20,5,Eric Cartman,We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that
916,20,5,Heidi and Cartman,We came together as a skewl.
917,20,6,Eric Cartman,[jumps] Whee! [waves at someone far away] Hi! [looks at a human city] So cool! [leaps towards the city]
918,20,6,Unnamed characters 1 and 2,[wave at Cartman] Hi!
919,20,6,Unnamed character 3,[waves at Cartman] Hi!
920,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Hi! [stops and sees a roller coaster] Dude, Mars rules. [leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules!"
921,20,6,Heidi Turner,"What are you thinking about, Babe?"
922,20,6,Eric Cartman,Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.
923,20,6,Heidi Turner,"You're worried about him again, aren't you? Your friend, Kyle?"
924,20,6,Eric Cartman,"[sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi."
925,20,6,Heidi Turner,Then talk to him babe. Tell him what we're doing. Maybe you can get him back.
926,20,6,Eric Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Heidi."
927,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[repeatedly clicks on keyboard and talks softly] Ha ha, yeah. I'm yours, bitch. Ha ha. [speaks louder]. Suck it! [moves the mouse] How about a dick in your mouth?! There you go! Ha ha, ha ha ha ha. [notices the door bell ringing] Aw! [walks to the front door, and opens it]"
928,20,6,Trolls,Hi Skankhunt!
929,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,[gets shocked] Ah! [tries looking behind him] What are you guys doing here?!
930,20,6,Dick,We came to celebrate!
931,20,6,PurpleheadedQueeflicker,Not everyday you troll a whole country.
932,20,6,Anonymous821,[showed a case of John Adams beer] We brought some beer. Let's have a trolling party.
933,20,6,PurpleheadedQueeflicker,We did it!
934,20,6,Dick,"I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world."
935,20,6,Trolls,Yeah! Yeah!
936,20,6,Troll 7,You said it!
937,20,6,SupersexyLisa18,Thanks to us!
938,20,6,Dick,"And I think on the next one, [raises his beer] we're only gonna get better."
939,20,6,Troll 4,No doubt about it.
940,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Wh-what are you talking about ""next one""?"
941,20,6,Dick,"Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world?"
942,20,6,Anonymous821,We're like super-trolls who could change anything.
943,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,[leans to Dick] Can I talk to you for a second?
944,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,Why did you bring them here?!
945,20,6,Dick,"What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt."
946,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are!
947,20,6,Dick,But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election.
948,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political!
949,20,6,Dick,Of course it's political!
950,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?!"
951,20,6,Dick,I remember being called a fag for no reason.
952,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go."
953,20,6,Dick,"Okay. [puts down his beer mug] Sure, Skankhunt. Whatever you say. [walks away]"
954,20,6,Garrison,Presidential election is only two weeks away. We have to [lifts a bag of memberberries talking] destroy these things.
955,20,6,Jar Berries,'Member the Bi-wing fighters? 'Member the Service Droids? I 'member.
956,20,6,Randy Marsh,[setting up experiment] That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried.
957,20,6,Experiment Berry,"'Member, 'member Mos Eisley? 'Member the Rancor, 'member? 'Member sand people? 'Member the Cantina? 'Member-- [gets torched by Randy and screams] My eyes!"
958,20,6,Jar Berries,"What's going on now? They're using a torch on him. Oh, are they gonna use a torch on us?!"
959,20,6,Experiment Berry,"Ah, Aaaaah! [stops getting torched] 'Member Bespin? 'Member Wedge? I loved Wedge. 'Member?"
960,20,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh, there has to be something."
961,20,6,Garrison,Try the acid.
962,20,6,Experiment Berry,'Member Mon Mothma? 'Member the rebel transports? [screams while acid is poured on him]
963,20,6,Jar Berries,"They're trying to destroy us. They are?! Our whole species?! They can't do that?! Yeah they can! 'Member the Death Star blowing up Alderaan? Oo, Alderaan, I 'member."
964,20,6,Experiment Berry,"[keeps on screaming until Randy runs out of acid] 'Member the Cloud City? 'Member IG-88, the bounty hunter droid? 'member, that was fanta'tic."
965,20,6,Randy Marsh,Damn it! [takes off flashlight] These things are impossible to get rid of.
966,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,[tilts head up] Yeah.
967,20,6,Eric Cartman,"[opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute?"
968,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, what do you want now?!"
969,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Just a second. Please, Kyle?"
970,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hurry up!
971,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby."
972,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah! Dude, what the fuck?"
973,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom."
974,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,I'm going to the bathroom!
975,20,6,Heidi Turner,"Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset."
976,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
977,20,6,Eric Cartman,"[walks away from the toilet] I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle?"
978,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks down] I have to stay with my group, Cartman."
979,20,6,Eric Cartman,"[walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think."
980,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little-- [sees FaceTime call from Dick] Ah. Oh no, not again! [accepts his call] Yes?"
981,20,6,Dick,"Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins."
982,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting.
983,20,6,Dick,"Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy."
984,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed.
985,20,6,Dick,"[sighs] Oh, alright. Look, [grabs his guitar] I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?"
986,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,No!
987,20,6,Dick,[sings badly while strumming his guitar] Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie  flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the--
988,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[ends the call] Bye! Jesus, what is wrong with people?! [drinks wine] Huh. [keeps typing] Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank."
989,20,6,Heidi Turner,"[To Kyle.] This is gonna seem a little weird to you, okay?"
990,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,What is?
991,20,6,Heidi Turner,"Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was."
992,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it."
993,20,6,Heidi Turner,"Before I stopped searching, I learned something. [opens her door] Take a look."
994,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,What is all this?
995,20,6,Heidi Turner,"To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it ""emoji analysis"". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away."
996,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that's pretty smart."
997,20,6,Eric Cartman,"She's funny too, Kyle."
998,20,6,Heidi Turner,"After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult."
999,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,You mean like one of the teachers?
1000,20,6,Heidi Turner,I think... it's one of the parents.
1001,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,Are you sure?
1002,20,6,Heidi Turner,"I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match."
1003,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Emoji analysis, it's genius!"
1004,20,6,Eric Cartman,You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.
1005,20,7,Bill Keegan,"And uh, definitely a bit of a surprise here. Looks like America has voted for a change of pace. The world is in a bit of a shock, uh... Is this? We're, we're for sure this is for real, right?"
1006,20,7,Randy Marsh,"What have you done?! You maniacs! [a man seated near the entrance pulls a gun out his back pocket and shoots himself in the head, falling off the chair.]"
1007,20,7,Bill Keegan,"We uh... I guess we're going live to the acceptance speech now? Uhh okay, here we go."
1008,20,7,President Elect Douche,"[with Caitlyn beside him] The people have spoken. Just as J.J. Abrams did with Star Wars, I will make this country great again."
1009,20,7,Randy Marsh,This isn't how it was supposed to happen.
1010,20,7,President Elect Douche,"All my efforts this past week have paid off. And now, let's begin... fucking them all to death!"
1011,20,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?"
1012,20,7,Butters Stotch,What do you want?!
1013,20,7,Eric Cartman,"[walks in] Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny?"
1014,20,7,Butters Stotch,"Well I don't know, Eric."
1015,20,7,Eric Cartman,"I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you ""Ghostbusters sucked balls"" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person."
1016,20,7,Butters Stotch,NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor!
1017,20,7,Eric Cartman,A traitor?
1018,20,7,Butters Stotch,"Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?!"
1019,20,7,Eric Cartman,Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!
1020,20,7,Butters Stotch,"Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now!"
1021,20,8,Government agent,"The political world is watching, Bannon. [gives Bannon a file] We need to make sure the president elect has a smooth transition."
1022,20,8,Steve Bannon,All indications are that his transition [flips a page] is going to be fine.
1023,20,8,Surgeon,"[walks by] We're just doing some finishing touches, but everything went well. You can see him now if you like."
1024,20,8,Caitlyn Jenner,I'll go.
1025,20,8,President Garrison,"[talks with Caitlyn] Well, do I look presidential?"
1026,20,8,Caitlyn Jenner,"Honestly, you look twenty years younger."
1027,20,8,President Garrison,"They really worked on my stank face. Look! Whenever I don't know what people are talking about, I just do this, [lowers his body] like look. [shows his stank face] I can do this. [shows his stank face again] This is, this is my stank face. [shows a different stank face] It's like, I'm not listening to you, see? [shows his other stank face] They did a really good job on my stank lips."
1028,20,8,Caitlyn Jenner,It's an amazing transition.
1029,20,8,President Garrison,"Now I feel ready to take care of business and do what really matters... [sits up straight] in just a minute, I'm gonna do the UV rays a bit longer."
1030,20,8,,[the machine closes enseals Garrison]
1031,20,8,Secretary,Can I help you?
1032,20,8,Cartman,"Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny."
1033,20,8,Secretary,...Okay.
1034,20,8,Cartman,We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi?
1035,20,8,Secretary,"...That'd be an understatement, yes."
1036,20,8,Cartman,"Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please."
1037,20,8,Secretary,Uh-huh. Take a number and join the others.
1038,20,8,Cartman,What others?
1039,20,8,,"[Cartman, Heidi, and the secretary turn their heads see a bunch of other people waiting, including Cher singing]"
1040,20,8,Cher,[garbled and auto-tuned] If I could turn back time...
1041,20,8,Cartman,"What the fuck, dude?!"
1042,20,8,Secretary,Lot of people want to leave the planet right now.
1043,20,8,Cartman,"Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!"
1044,20,8,Cher,"[garbled and auto-tuned] Do you believe in leaving the world, oh..."
1045,20,8,PC Principal,God [knocks down papers] dammit! [knocks down lamp] How the fuck did this happen?!
1046,20,8,Mr. Mackey,"[knocks the door and opens it] Uh, sorry PC Principal, but someone wants to speak with you."
1047,20,8,PC Principal,"I told you to leave me alone, Mackey! [slams fist on the desk] I'm not in the mood!"
1048,20,8,Mr. Mackey,"But, but sir, the president elect is here. [moves away from Garrison]"
1049,20,8,President Garrison,"[enters the office with two Secret Service agents following him] So sorry for the intrusion. You're not too busy, I hope."
1050,20,8,PC Principal,"Uh, not at all. Please uh, have a seat, Mr. Garrison."
1051,20,8,President Garrison,Excuse me?
1052,20,8,PC Principal,"Uh, please have a seat, Mr... President."
1053,20,8,President Garrison,"That's better, bitch. [sits down and takes out a piece of gum]"
1054,20,8,PC Principal,"Certainly want to uh, congratulate you on the election."
1055,20,8,President Garrison,"Do you remember the day you fired me, PC Principal?"
1056,20,8,PC Principal,"I know we've had some differences, uh..."
1057,20,8,President Garrison,"I was upset because a bunch of immigrants were changing my class and I believe your response was that I needed to go and ""learn their language"", ""be more open-minded""."
1058,20,8,PC Principal,I'm sorry that your position here at the school was terminated.
1059,20,8,President Garrison,"Are you really? [makes stank face] Are you really sorry? [makes different stank face] Because you see PC Principal, you helped create me. You insisted that I was a bigot, that I was an intolerant relic left over from another time. But now, I'm your president. And if there's one thing I've learned about becoming president, it's that your penis can get really dry. When all the skin on your penis is drying out from working so hard to get elected there's only one thing that can fix it, isn't there? Saliva, from a good friend who once doubted you. I need you to fix my problem, PC Principal, so that we can be even-stevens. What do you say, bud?"
1060,20,8,PC Principal,[is in complete shock]
1061,20,8,Unknown Berries,"Oh, 'member when it fell in her drink. Yeah, I 'member."

1084,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Please, you have to let me outta here!"
1085,20,8,Dick,"Skankhunt, stop!"
1086,20,8,Lennart Bedrager,"[talks from above] Yes, please. You're making a very jackass of-a yourself."
1087,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,[walks to see Bedrager's face]
1088,20,8,Lennart Bedrager,"Well well, what do we have here? Looks like your little troll-party."
1089,20,8,Troll 4,"You Danish pricks, you tricked us!"
1090,20,8,Lennart Bedrager,"We didn't trick you, your own government did. They thought if they handed you over to us we would agree not to go forward with the TrollTrace program."
1091,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,You can't hold people prisoner! I haven't done anything! People are gonna be looking for me!
1092,20,8,Lennart Bedrager,"[takes out his phone] By all means, [tosses the phone to Gerald] contact whoever you want. Of course, you'll have to tell them why you're here."
1093,20,8,Dick,What are you gonna do with us?
1094,20,8,Lennart Bedrager,"We're going to use you to set the world on fire. When the servers go online, there will be chaos, panic, and war. And from the ashes, a new world will rise: a world where everyone is happy, and singing, and has no secrets, [yells] like Denmark! [punches a railing]"
1095,20,8,Dick,You think you can turn countries in the world against each other? Our president will never let that happen.
1096,20,8,President Garrison,"Hey everybody! [walks to a checkout line, takes a mic, and hums ""Hail To The Chief""] Guess who's here? It's the President of the United Fucking States. [mic drop, then walks around the store] Oh, it's been a while since I've heard from you guys. Hi, Janice. [takes a small bottle of water from her shopping basket and opens it, tossing the cap away] Hello, Stephen."
1097,20,8,Stephen Stotch,[looks away] Mr. President.
1098,20,8,President Garrison,"[walks around the store some more] I was just, you know, passing through the old neighborhood [checks out a tomato paste can from another shopper] thinking about what laws I might get rid of, when suddenly, out of nowhere, my penis got really dry. You know if they have anything at this store for a dry dick? Huh? No? You guys can't think of anything? Oh, I know. What about [points to] Eduardo Hernandez? I believe it was Eduardo who told me I couldn't double-bag my groceries, even though he's from fucking Guatemala. Well, what do you think now, Eduardo? You wanna double-bag somethin' else? [his phone rings, and he pulls out out of his back pocket to answer it] This is the President."
1099,20,8,First General,"Sir, we need you at the Pentagon. It's a matter of national security."
1100,20,8,President Garrison,"Oh, really? I'm kinda busy right now, jeez."
1101,20,8,First General,"Sir, the Danish have released a statement. I'm afraid... we may be going to war."
1102,20,8,President Garrison,War?
1103,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Ike?! Ike, buddy, can you hear me?! I need you to do something, okay? Daddy needs your help! I need you to go to your browser and sign on to the school message board, okay? Can you do that for me? The school message board and then log in. Lowercase S, skank-hunt-4-2. You got it?"
1104,20,8,Dick,Wow.
1105,20,8,Anonymous821,"Wow, what?"
1106,20,8,Dick,He's gonna have his son sign in and troll for him.
1107,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[covers his phone and faces the other trolls] If Skankhunt is still out there trolling, then they have the wrong guy! Get it?! It's called ""using your brain"", fatso!"
1108,20,8,Anonymous821,So they'll blame your kid?
1109,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Nobody cares if a kid trolls! What are they gonna do, get a slap on the wrist?"
1110,20,8,Dick,[stands up] Didn't you hear what that guy said? They're gonna set countries against each other! We have way bigger problems!
1111,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"You don't know my fucking wife! [faces the phone] Ike, you got it? Great, pal! Okay, now I need you to go to the comment section, okay, and type in ""You should all get raped by gorillas"". You got that pal? Ike, ""You should all get raped by gorillas""! Come on, we have a lot of work to do here!"
1112,20,8,Cartman,"Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long."
1113,20,8,Heidi,"You really think this is what we should do, babe? I gonna miss everyone."
1114,20,8,Cartman,"I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better."
1115,20,8,Butters,"Hey, Eric! [seen right near Cartman]"
1116,20,8,Cartman,[speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here?
1117,20,8,Butters,"Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number."
1118,20,8,Cartman,"Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars."
1119,20,8,Butters,"[shows complete fear] No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse."
1120,20,8,Various Memberberries,"'Member The Fugitive? [Millions of Memberberries are 'membering.] 'Member Aliens? [They begin to jump the fence] Here we are! Ah, yeah! I 'member.

1126,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay now make sure the little worm is in the woman's mouth, got it?"
1127,20,8,Ike Broflovski,[puts penis in photoshopped mouth]
1128,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Now I need you to type ""You're a fat retard"" in the comments."
1129,20,8,Ike Broflovski,"[types in the comment section] ""You're a retard."""
1130,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"No, you have to say ""a fat retard"", Ike! It's a nuance, but it's very important!"
1131,20,8,Ike Broflovski,"[types in the comment section] ""You are a fat retard."""
1132,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,[sees what Ike is doing and is in shock] Ike! What are you doing?!
1133,20,8,Ike Broflovski,What he says.
1134,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,[exits Skype chat]
1135,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,"[walks into Ike's room and gets a closer look] It was you, all this time! What have you done, Ike?! Do you have any idea the damage you've caused?! How could my child be such a monster?! [answers the call on her phone] Yes yes, hello?!"
1136,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[talks on his phone to Sheila] Hey sweetheart, how's everything going?"
1137,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,"You have to come home from helping the government, Gerald! I just caught Ike trolling Mrs. Herrera!"
1138,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,Are you serious?
1139,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes! The school troll is our son, Gerald! You should see all the things he's posted on his computer!"
1140,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,God dang it! Let me talk to him right now!
1141,20,8,Shelia,[hands her phone to Ike]
1142,20,8,Ike Broflovski,Hello?
1143,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey Ike, just stay calm and act like I'm yelling at you, okay pal? Okay, give it a few seconds, wait. Good. Okay, now--now say ""I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside""."
1144,20,8,Ike Broflovski,No!
1145,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Ike, you have to listen to me. On your mother's life, this is a matter of national security! You have to say ""I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside""!"
1146,20,8,Ike Broflovski,[angrily] I'm sorry dad. I'm just fucked up inside.
1147,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"That was amazing, kiddo. It'll all be worth it, okay? I'll make this up to you. Give me back to your mom."
1148,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,[takes her phone back] Gerald?!
1149,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"He's full of shit, he's not sorry! If he felt sorry, he wouldn't be able to do it in the first place!"
1150,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,I know!
1151,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"I'm gonna get home as soon as I can to deal with this, okay? We can deal with this together. Just don't say anything to anyone for now, all right?"
1152,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Okay. Okay yeah, I love you too. I know. Bye. [ends the call and talks to Ike] You just sit in here until we figure out what to do; and if you get back on that computer, you are done, you got it?! [leaves Ike's room]"
1153,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[starts a Skype call on Ike's computer] Ike! Okay there's just a few more things I need you to do. I need you to type ""How'd you like a donkey dick?""."
1154,20,8,First General,"[salutes] Welcome to the Pentagon, sir. I've been ordered to show you around. [turns around] This way, please."
1155,20,8,President Garrison,"[follows the general] So I can do whatever the fuck I want in here now, right?"
1156,20,8,First General,"Yes, sir. Here are all [gives Garrison a folder of classified information] our military secrets and all classified information."
1157,20,8,President Garrison,"[takes folder] Okay, good."
1158,20,8,First General,[stops everyone by the Drone Program entrance] This is the Drone Program. In there you can kill anyone on Earth remotely. Here's the keys. [gives keys to Garrison]
1159,20,8,President Garrison,Thanks!
1160,20,8,,[everyone continues walking]
1161,20,8,First General,In here is satellite surveillance where you can monitor anyone's conversation live.
1162,20,8,President Garrison,Oh that will come in handy.
1163,20,8,First General,Extreme interrogation [stops everyone] room in case you find interrogation necessary.
1164,20,8,President Garrison,"Oh hell yeah, it's necessary. Let's do it."
1165,20,8,First General,"[gives Garrison a briefcase] And here of course is the famous ""football"", where you could order a nuclear attack in four minutes. [walks away]"
1166,20,8,President Garrison,Love me some football. [follows the general]
1167,20,8,First General,"[stops everyone by the Diplomatic Strategy entrance] And finally, in here, is the diplomatic strategy and negotiating room. [opens the doors, having everyone enter the room]"
1168,20,8,President Garrison,"Well, jeez, this doesn't look very fun."
1169,20,8,Second General,Thank God you're here sir. We need your guidance.
1170,20,8,Butters,"Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too."
1171,20,8,Cartman,"Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance."
1172,20,8,Butters,"No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect."
1173,20,8,Cartman,"Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?"
1174,20,8,Butters,Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton?
1175,20,8,Heidi,"Oh yeah, that movie was funny."
1176,20,8,Butters,Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great.
1177,20,8,Heidi,"Wow, I guess you're right."
1178,20,8,Cartman,"Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!"
1179,20,8,Butters,"Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time."
1180,20,8,Cartman,"[looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing."
1181,20,8,Heidi,"What, babe?"
1182,20,8,Cartman,"Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?"
1183,20,8,Heidi,[giggles] Why do you want me telling you jokes all the time?
1184,20,8,Cartman,Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious.
1185,20,8,Heidi,"Well, did I tell you the one about the skeleton and the skunk?"
1186,20,8,Butters,[laughs] That's already funny! [Cartman gets frustrated and makes a fist with his left hand]
1187,20,8,Second General,"All around the world, countries are mobilizing armies and preparing defensive countermeasures."
1188,20,8,President Garrison,Why? What the hell happened?
1189,20,8,First General,This is everything you need to know about the TROLL TRACE program.
1190,20,8,President Garrison,What's TROLL TRACE?
1191,20,8,First General,A plan by the Danish to release the full internet histories of everyone on Earth.
1192,20,8,Second General,"The previous administration tried to work with the Danish by handing over several trolls, but the plan didn't work."
1193,20,8,First General,The entire world has become very uncertain and unstable.
1194,20,8,Second General,We think we should order all navy vessels to the Bering Sea.
1195,20,8,President Garrison,For what?
1196,20,8,First General,"Because when the Chinese are able to see all our e-mails and online activity, we believe they will most likely attack us. Also, there are ground troops mobilizing in Paris because the French believe when we see all their e-mails, we will most likely attack them."
1197,20,8,Third General,"Mr. President, sir! The Russians are asking what we intend to do about the Danish."
1198,20,8,President Garrison,"Well, why are you asking me?"
1199,20,8,Second General,"Please, sir, we have very little time before this escalates beyond our control."
1200,20,8,Aide 1,"Президент Путин, Датское утверждает, что они всё ещё готовы включить программу Troll Trase."
1201,20,8,Vladimir Putin,"Это всё, что я сказай, всё, что я сделай на Интернет будет доступно моей подруге?"
1202,20,8,Aide 1,"Да, кажется так."
1203,20,8,Vladimir Putin,"Датское должно быть оставновлены! Мы нужно знать, как Соединённые Штаты стоят на этом! [behind him, the phone rings at his desk and a second aide pops in to answer it]"
1204,20,8,Aide 2,"Э... Господин президент, Овальный кабинет. [Putin walks to the phone]"
1205,20,8,Vladimir Putin,"Да, это президент Путин."
1206,20,8,Memberberry 3,'Member the Death Star?
1207,20,8,Memberberry 1,"Ahahaha, 'member cutting open tauntauns?"
1208,20,8,Memberberry 4,"Yeah, yeah, 'member the Force? [the berries chuckle]"
1209,20,8,Vladimir Putin,Что это такое?
1210,20,8,Tubbs,"Heheh, heheh, yeah, sure, I 'member."
1211,20,8,Memberberry 1,Member McGy-?
1212,20,8,Tubbs,"Sure, I 'member."
1213,20,8,Memberberry 3,'Member?
1214,20,8,Memberberry 2,"Heheh, hey hey hey, 'member the Cold War?"
1215,20,8,Memberberry 1,Oh I loved the Cold War! That was fantastic!
1216,20,8,SpaceX Tour Assistant,"Okay, Numbers 204 through 215, you can come on through."
1217,20,8,Cartman,"[leaves with Heidi] Oh, finally."
1218,20,8,Butters,"Hey, that's me too. Yippee!"
1219,20,8,SpaceX Tour Assistant,"Right in here, everyone. [The group, which includes Cher, walks in, and the door slams shut behind them]"
1220,20,8,Elon Musk,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tour. I'm Elon Musk. Are we gonna have some fun today?"
1221,20,8,Cartman,"Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars."
1222,20,8,Elon Musk,"And getting anywhere takes ingenuity. Oh, Mrs. Door? Would you mind... opening, please?"
1223,20,8,PA Door Voice,"[interactive doors] Yes, Elon. [the doors rattle, but don't open. Elon turns and opens them manually. A chime plays as the doors open, and Elon leads the group onto the factory floor]"
1224,20,8,Elon Musk,"The only way for humankind to survive is with imagination and technology. Cars that run on electricity. Solar panels that replace roof shingles. Even food that changes form. You see this? It's a pizza, only four inches long. And yet, when heated, it expands to make enough pizza to feed a hundred people. I call it the pizza... pocket."
1225,20,8,Cartman,[whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets.
1226,20,8,Elon Musk,Who would like to see the Hyperloop? A new mode of travel that can take you from here to Dubai in nine minutes.
1227,20,8,Cartman,"Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?"
1228,20,8,Staffer 1,"Sir, India is moving aircraft carriers into the Gulf of Mexico."
1229,20,8,President Garrison,Well why would we care about Mexicans?!
1230,20,8,Staffer 2,"[in winter fatigues] Sir, a message from Saudi Arabia. They say they pinky-promise not to look up our Internet history if we pinky-promise not to look up theirs."
1231,20,8,President Garrison,Well what does that even mean?!
1232,20,8,Staffer 3,"[in winter fatigues] Still waiting on if we should send troops into Japan, sir."
1233,20,8,President Garrison,"I don't know, jeez!"
1234,20,8,First General,"Sir, it's the UK Secretary of Foreign Affairs calling from London. He says they have advice for you."
1235,20,8,President Garrison,What?
1236,20,8,Boris Johnson,"Yes, hello? Things aren't looking good here. We just want to say, whatever you do, don't eat the membberries."
1237,20,8,UK Aide,[overhearing] Don't eat the membberries. They are bad.
1238,20,8,President Garrison,Memberries?
1239,20,8,Boris Johnson,"I'm afraid everyone here who ate the memberries wanted to go back in the past, you see. Hasn't worked out too well for us."
1240,20,8,UK Aide,We shouldn't have ate the memberries!
1241,20,8,Boris Johnson,"The memberries cloud your judgement. They get inside your head, you see."
1242,20,8,President Garrison,"Get inside your head... Wait a minute... Nobody gets in my head, you limey bitch! Are you insulting me?! Stop wasting my time! 'Cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours suckin' my dick!! [slams the phone down on the receiver]"
1243,20,8,UK Aide,What'd he say?
1244,20,8,Boris Johnson,I believe they've eaten the memberries.
1245,20,8,UK Aide,"Ooh, dear!"
1246,20,8,UK Aide 2,"Ooh, dear!"
1247,20,8,Elon Musk,"Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets. They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on Earth for reuse. [the group moves back to the lobby] Well, I certainly wanna thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group. Give yourselves a round of applause."
1248,20,8,Groups,Huh?
1249,20,8,Cartman,"Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?"
1250,20,8,Elon Musk,Mars? We're still about ten years away from going to Mars. Maybe eight.
1251,20,8,Groups,Awwww.
1252,20,8,Cartman,"No, no nonono, we have to go now!"
1253,20,8,Elon Musk,"Well I'm sorry, but it's a bit more complicated than a pizza pocket. Going to Mars is gonna take a lot of very smart people working very hard for a very long time. Now, if you don't mind, I have hundreds of more tours to do. [turns to exit the lobby]"
1254,20,8,Butters,"Mr. Musk, wait! [Musk turns around] Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart, and really funny. [Cartman flashes an angry face at Butters]"
1255,20,8,Elon Musk,Like... how funny?
1256,20,8,Memberberry Don,"Out of the way, 'member?"
1257,20,8,Berry Henchmen,"You'd better 'member if you know what's good for youse! [the car moves through the crowd, down the corridors and into the Oval Office]"
1258,20,8,Various Memberberries,"Hey look, it's them. 'Member? Sure, I 'member. [the mobster berries get out of the car]"
1259,20,8,Memberberry Don,"Ey, youse did good. Who's in charge, 'member?"
1260,20,8,Memberberry 3,We decided he's in charge.
1261,20,8,Memberberry 1,"No, we said I'm in charge, 'member?"
1262,20,8,Memberberry 4,"No wait, I 'member. We all said he's in charge. [leans to the left]"
1263,20,8,Memberberry 2,"Oh yeah, I 'member."
1264,20,8,Memberberry Don,Wrong. [shoots Member Berry 2 clear through. Member Berry 2 collapses and bleeds out green juice]
1265,20,8,Memberberry 3,Waaah!
1266,20,8,Memberberry Don,'Member stormtroopers?
1267,20,8,Memberberry 2,"Sure, I 'member."
1268,20,8,Memberberry Don,Not those stormtroopers! The real old ones. People wanna 'member? They're gonna 'member.
1269,20,8,Kyle,"Ike? [Ike looks back at Kyle, then puts his head on the wall again] What are you doing?"
1270,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,Don't talk to him! He is in big trouble!
1271,20,8,Kyle,Well what'd he do?
1272,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,"It's him, Kyle! Your brother is the internet troll who's caused all this pain in our community!"
1273,20,8,Kyle,What?
1274,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,It was him all along. Now we have to figure out what to tell people when they learn this ugliness came from our family. [walks back into the kitchen]
1275,20,8,Kyle,You made people quit Twitter? You started a war between boys and girls? You...?
1276,20,8,Heidi,"I call it ""Emoji Analysis"". It isn't a student, it's an adult."
1277,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,This ugliness came from our family!
1278,20,8,Heidi,I think it's one of the parents.
1279,20,8,Gerald Broflovski,You're suppose to just laugh and make fun of shit.
1280,20,8,Ike Broflovski,Daddy called you a pussy.
1281,20,8,Kyle,"[stops thinking back] Oh my God. Oh my God! Ike, come on! [grabs Ike's hand and rushes out the front door with him. Sheila hears the front door open and looks around for her boys. She reaches the open front door]"
1282,20,8,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle? Ike?! Whatwhatwhaaat?! [her voice echoes around the neighborhood]
1283,20,9,Harrison Yates,"Everyone calm down, please. We have to have civil order. Listen to me."
1284,20,9,,[crowd stops chattering]
1285,20,9,Unknown person,Really?
1286,20,9,Harrison Yates,"Now I know everyone's scared, but we have to keep control. Yes all of our emails and Internet histories are about to become public knowledge."
1287,20,9,,[crowd chatters]
1288,20,9,Harrison Yates,"[raises his arms] But, but,"
1289,20,9,,[crowd stops]
1290,20,9,Harrison Yates,"we all need to understand that TrollTrace will never happen if people don't log on to use it. The website is a massive database that cross-references everything ever said on the Internet. It relies on people typing in a name and address of someone else [lays arms on stand] to add to that database. If we could all agree to resist the urge to look up other people's Internet histories, [looks at Maggie] Maggie, okay? As long as we all respect each other's privacy, darling, [looks straight ahead] then our town won't suffer the same fate as Fort Collins."
1291,20,9,Stephen Stotch,"And what are the police gonna do to make sure people don't use it?! I know I'll certainly respect others' privacy, but about other people like [points at Laura] Laura Tucker the Blabbermouth?"
1292,20,9,Laura Tucker,Excuse me?
1293,20,9,Harrison Yates,"And that's why we have to come together as a community, and resist any temptation to use TrollTrace, [looks at Maggie] Maggie. We have to stay in control. [looks in front of him] This hack of our city will never happen, so long as we rely on the rationality and the basic decency of the American people."
1294,20,9,,[crowd panics and runs away]
1295,20,9,Harrison Yates,Guess I could've worded that differently.
1296,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[yells] What were you thinking?! How dare you outright defy me like that! Your brother was being punished for using the computer and you decide to just leave with him?
1297,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I just felt bad for him, ma."
1298,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"You felt bad for him, after all the horrible things he said to people online?! Your brother is a sick troll, Kyle! You just wait until your father gets home! [leaves the room and closes the door]"
1299,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Ike, where the fuck have you been?! Daddy needs your help. You don't want Mommy and Daddy to get divorced, do you? [paces] You know how bad your mom is, she completely overreacts to everything. That's where your brother gets it from. You don't want to be like Kyle, do you?"
1300,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,[goes in front of the computer] Hi dad.
1301,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[gets shocked] Hey, buddy! Everything good there?"
1302,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It was you, this whole time. You're the troll that caused all of this trouble."
1303,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"No, it was your brother. I don't know what's wrong with him, Kyle. He needs counseling..."
1304,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Heidi Turner did an emoji analysis. It was an adult. It was you.
1305,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[starts talking right before Kyle finished] Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Okay, keep your voice down."
1306,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,[talks softly] Why dad? Why did you do this?
1307,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Because it's fucking funny, Kyle. It's called having a sense of humor, and laughing. You should fucking try it once in a while!"
1308,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Putting a penis in the mouth of a mom who has cancer is funny?!
1309,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Because it's so not funny, God! Pushing people's buttons to get a reaction can actually be very good for society, Kyle. Listen to me, the Danish are fucking crazy. You have to get people to stop them."
1310,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,How?!
1311,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Go get people riled up. Call the President. I don't know. When you push people's buttons, they go and push other people's buttons. Now get out there and... [ends call]"
1312,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[enters Ike's room and yells] Kyle, Ike! What the hell is this?! What did I say?! Get off of that computer riiight nooooow!"
1313,20,9,Ike Broflovski,[puts his head down]
1314,20,9,Secretary,"Uh everyone, please listen! We don't have any rockets going to Mars! Yo-you're not listening! We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet. We're working as hard as we can. There's a little girl working on the people right now and apparently she's incredibly smart and funny."
1315,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe?"
1316,20,9,Heidi Turner,"[grabs mug] Babe, I have no idea what any of this means."
1317,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it."
1318,20,9,Heidi Turner,"Girls rule, women are funny, get over it."
1319,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back."
1320,20,9,Heidi Turner,[sighs]
1321,20,9,Elon Musk,"Uh excuse me. Sorry, can we have a word please?"
1322,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk]"
1323,20,9,Elon Musk,This doesn't seem like it's gonna work out and we're rather busy.
1324,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth."
1325,20,9,Elon Musk,I haven't really heard her say anything funny.
1326,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself."
1327,20,9,Butters Stotch,"[sits on chair, watching the conversation] He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot."
1328,20,9,Eric Cartman,[faces Butters with a mad face]
1329,20,9,Dick,Here they come.
1330,20,9,,"[Dane 2 opens the door as Bedrager, Dane 1, Dane 4, and him enter. The trolls stand up]"
1331,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh thank god. There's been a mistake, okay?! I'm not one of [points at the other trolls] them. My son is Skankhunt42. Go online and see, he's still doing it!"
1332,20,9,Dane 2,[points a gun at the trolls]
1333,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"All of you, remove your clothes."
1334,20,9,Anonymous821,What are you gonna do with us?
1335,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,Remove your clothes now!
1336,20,9,,[the trolls strip themselves naked]
1337,20,9,Dane 2,"[enters] In here, move."
1338,20,9,,"[trolls enter the room in a line where they are put on separate chairs, handcuffed]"
1339,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[gets frieghtened] Oh god! Oh god, they're gonna [gets kicked by Dane 5] kill us! No no, wait! Okay okay, it was me! You're right, I'm Skankhunt! But I am not like them. Please, [gets put on a chair] I have a good job! I'm a good guy! [gets handcuffed] I'm sorry! [sighs heavily] I was just being funny! I was trying to make people laugh! [sees the Danes leaving the room] That's a positive thing, right?! I wasn't doing it to hurt people, I was just doing comedy. It's different! Please, it's different!"
1340,20,9,,[the door closes]
1341,20,9,Father Maxi,"Lord, we look to thee on this to our most trouble hour. We have been let astray and now all we could do is wait for the inevitable to happen. Soon everything we have said and done online is going to be known to all. Many lives will be turned upside down. Of course, I have nothing to worry about; since I'm a priest, there's nothing I'm ashamed of doing on the Internet, so [turns a page] definitely no reason to look up my history. But uh for many, this is a time to pray."
1342,20,9,Everyone,"[speak in unison] O'Lord, please forgive for things we might have done online."
1343,20,9,Harrison Yates,Maggie.
1344,20,9,Men,"Please try to understand that even some of us who were on MatchingMavis.com, it was only out of curiosity, and not because we actually having an affair. Please understand that we might have used racial slurs, but only because it was to a close friend and never meant to be public."
1345,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters with Ike] What are you all doing?! [walks closer to the priest] Somebody's threatening your way of life and you all are just sitting here praying, like uh a bunch of babies?"
1346,20,9,Ike Broflovski,[follows Kyle] Like a bunch of pussies!
1347,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, this isn't South Park! What's happened to us?! We used to have a challenge and deal with it, then move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling and Internet stuff over and over, week after week; and I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of it."
1348,20,9,Randy Marsh,Yeah.
1349,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,[stands on a step near Maxi] Now for once let's take a stand and try to end this. We can't let Denmark change who we are.
1350,20,9,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, fuck Denmark."
1351,20,9,Prayers,[speak after one another] Yeah!
1352,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys need to, you know, call the President and get him to take action."
1353,20,9,Prayers,[speak in disappointment] Aw!
1354,20,9,Stephen Stotch,The President? He won't listen to us. He hates us now.
1355,20,9,Randy Marsh,"No, [stands up] but there is somebody he will still listen to."
1356,20,9,First General,"Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization blinked we've never seen. Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked."
1357,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Well what do they want me to do about it?
1358,20,9,Second General,You're the leader of the free world.  Everyone's looking to you to be the call and steady voice they all need.
1359,20,9,Army Soldier,"[salutes] Mr. President? Mr. President, the Isreali prime minister is on Line 1, the chancellor of Germany is on Line 2, and a Mr. Slave is on Line 3."
1360,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Mr. Slave? [picks up the phone on Line 3] This is the President.
1361,20,9,Mr Slave,"[talks at his house while looking at his fingernails] Hey, what's up?"
1362,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Well well well, crawling outta the woodwork to try and get me back now that I am a big cheese?"
1363,20,9,Mr Slave,"No, I'm calling because people want you to bomb Denmark."
1364,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Who wants me to bomb Denmark?
1365,20,9,Mr Slave,Lots of people 'cause it's like gonna ruin their freedom of speech or something.
1366,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Slave, this is all very complicated, diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't just go bombing other countries."
1367,20,9,Mr Slave,"Oh Jesus Christ, you're such a little bitch."
1368,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh I'm a bitch, huh? I happen to be President, bitch!"
1369,20,9,Mr Slave,"You're a little bitch, President. You're too scared to bomb anybody."
1370,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"I'm not scared, my advisors have told me that I..."
1371,20,9,Mr Slave,"Yeah, you're scared, just do what your little advisors tell you to do."
1372,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"If I decide a military strike on Denmark is warranted, then I will..."
1373,20,9,Mr Slave,"You don't have the balls to bomb them, pussy."
1374,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Pussy ass bitch.
1375,20,9,Mr Slave,"Pussy ass bitch, fuck you."
1376,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh [rambles] okay! You think so, huh?! Well watch this you gay asshole! [yells at the generals] Bomb Denmark!"
1377,20,9,First General,Sir?
1378,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"[turns around] The TrollTrace building or the whole fucking thing! Whatever it is, get the missiles ready!"
1379,20,9,Mr Slave,"[talks to others in his house] Yeah, it worked."
1380,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Alright!
1381,20,9,,[everyone else cheered]
1382,20,9,Butters Stotch,[talks to woman employee walking by] Hello. [enters the bathroom]
1383,20,9,Eric Cartman,[enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing?
1384,20,9,Butters Stotch,[talks to Cartman] Going pee!
1385,20,9,Eric Cartman,"I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!"
1386,20,9,Butters Stotch,Because you keep on telling everyone she is.
1387,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Butters, Heidi is everything to me.  If you take her, I swear to god..."
1388,20,9,Butters Stotch,"Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends! [walks closer to the toilets] I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart."
1389,20,9,Eric Cartman,What are you talking about?
1390,20,9,Butters Stotch,"That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop."
1391,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny."
1392,20,9,Butters Stotch,"Sure buddy, sure."
1393,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Officials have stated that all communication with Denmark has end, and that a military strike on the country is now imminent."
1394,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Yay!
1395,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,The President stated that since then...
1396,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[enters the room] Are you serious right now?!
1397,20,9,Kyle Ike,Augh! [get off the chair]
1398,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[yells] Get off that computerrrr!
1399,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ma, we were just using it to look at the news."
1400,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"I don't care, I said no computers! You kids are addicted to the Internet! You're sick, and you're addicted! It's changed your brother, and now it's turning you against me, Kyle!"
1401,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm not against you, mom."
1402,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"You are! Your father goes away on business and all you do is defy me at every turn! The next time you defy me, it will be your last! Do you understand?!"
1403,20,9,Kyle Ike,"Yes, mom."
1404,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"And when your father is home from Denmark, you two are both going in for counseling."
1405,20,9,Kyle Ike,[in complete shock] Denmark?
1406,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,What is dad doing in Denmark?!
1407,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"The government sent him over to do paralegal training, so it would've nice if you could've shown a little support! [leaves the room and shuts the door]"
1408,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Ohhh shit.
1409,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,[whimpering]Oh God! [continues whimpering]
1410,20,9,Anonymous821,Will somebody shut him up?
1411,20,9,Dick,"Skank. Skank, get ahold of yourself"
1412,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"You were right, Dildo, when you said I was a dick, when you called me an asshole. I am. And now I'm going to die alone, just like you said (starts crying again)"
1413,20,9,Dick,Come on. You're not an asshole
1414,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[sobbing] You said I was, though, 'cause I only trolled to be...funny."
1415,20,9,Dick,"Well--Well, maybe being funny is just sort of how you deal with serious subjects."
1416,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[sobbing] Really? You don't think I'm a bad person? I'm sorry. All you guys, I'm sorry"
1417,20,9,Trolls,"That's okay. Okay, Skank. All right"
1418,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,[calling out to TrollTrace staff] Excuse me. Hello?
1419,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Could I please speak to the person in charge? [Bedrager hears Gerald and walks over to the monitor] I have something to say. [security camera zooms in on Gerald] Please, just for a moment?"
1420,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,[stares intently at the monitor with the other employees] Bring him to the conference room
1421,20,9,Heidi Turner,"[sighs], Dude, I am so not getting this."
1422,20,9,Eric Cartman,[walks away in shock]
1423,20,9,Eric Cartman,[walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.
1424,20,9,Butters Stotch,"Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us."
1425,20,9,Eric Cartman,[Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?
1426,20,9,Butters Stotch,"The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars."
1427,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!"
1428,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for talking to me. I just really needed to get something off my chest. I'm so sorry. I had the biggest epiphany about the damage I've done, the people I've hurt, but the fact of the matter is I'm not really a troll. [Bedrager continues eating and not paying attention to Gerald.] I actually have a job. I'm a lawyer. I've got a loving wife and great kids. Uhm, I've got a family that really misses me and needs me."
1429,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[continues eating and not looking at Gerald] Freja Ollegard, the volleyball player, had a family, too. They miss her quite a lot too."
1430,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"And that--that is so tragic. And I'm so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling. It's--It's wrong. But, you know, I just sort of set things in motion. See, I'm a satirist. I challenge people's point of views by being sort of edgy. [Bedrager stops and hears Gerald out] And sometimes, people can be like ""Whoa!"" and mistake that for hate, but its not hate. Its pointing out hypocrisies in out society."
1431,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,You're so full of skinkinslat I can smell it from here.
1432,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"If you say mean things and you're mean, then I agree, you should be killed. But if you're being funny, which spreads joy --"
1433,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,You really think my plan is to kill you?
1434,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,It's not?
1435,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[To the two Danes standing guard] Leave us. [shoos them away with his hand] Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
1436,20,9,,[The two Danes walk out of the room.]
1437,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,[In a sinister tone] Do you want to know what's really funny?
1438,20,9,First General,"Mr. President, the bombers are en route to Europe."
1439,20,9,Second General,Are you sure you want to proceed with this?
1440,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"[Licking his ice cream spoon]Yeah, yeah. Bomb the shit out of them. We have to be tough here."
1441,20,9,Army Soldier,"Mr. President? Mr. President, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg is on Line 1, the Chairman of the Worker's Party is on Line 2, and Kyle is on Line 3."
1442,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Oh geez. What does Kyle want.
1443,20,9,,[Walks over to red phone and picks up the receiver]
1444,20,9,Mr. Garrison,This is the President
1445,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[in his bedroom, with Ike] Mr. Garrison, you can't bomb Denmark!"
1446,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Kyle."
1447,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's--It's wrong and it could start a bigger war.
1448,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle, this is all very serious diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't understand the political complexities involved here."
1449,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,[Looks at phone in shock and then thinks of an answer] I understand that you're a dipshit little gay puppet.
1450,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Excuse me?
1451,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.
1452,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Who told you that?
1453,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Everyone knows that. You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into doing.
1454,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle, I am the President."
1455,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're a little dipshit president.
1456,20,9,Ike Broflovski,With a dirty...asshole.
1457,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,With a dirty asshole.
1458,20,9,Ike Broflovski,And...you shit out your dick.
1459,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,And you shit out your dick. [covers phone with hand and looks at Ike] Where did you learn to talk like this?
1460,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Daddy!
1461,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh that's what people think, huh? Well, maybe I won't bomb Denmark. What do you think about that?"
1462,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you will, because you're a little retarded shit bitch."
1463,20,9,Mr. Garrison,[Yelling] God fucking damn it [slams receiver] Hold up! Hold up on the fucking bombs a minute!
1464,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?"
1465,20,9,Heidi Turner,"[Stares intently at white board, not paying attention to Cartman] I don't understand what any of these symbols mean, so in my head I'm trying to replace them with something I know to try and see patterns."
1466,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?"
1467,20,9,Heidi Turner,"And when I do that, I can see how everything lines up except for one thing."
1468,20,9,,"[As Heidi continues staring at the board, the formulas start changing into random emojis]"
1469,20,9,Heidi Turner,"[Thinking] I call it [echo] ""Emoji Analysis"" [the formulas keeping changing into emojis as the echo continues]."
1470,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like ""Could you--Could you hand me my water,"" or something. I can't--I can't remember."
1471,20,9,Heidi Turner,"These two don't line up, babe. The only things that are out of order."
1472,20,9,Eric Cartman,Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?
1473,20,9,Heidi Turner,[Turns to Elon Musk and his staff] Excuse me. Is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence?
1474,20,9,,[the Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker review his clipboard notes]
1475,20,9,SpaceX Employee,I'm sorry?
1476,20,9,Heidi Turner,That stuff there. Its in the wrong place. It needs to come before that.
1477,20,9,,[the employees review their notes again]
1478,20,9,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,[Looks at his laptop] Wait a minute. She might be on to something here
1479,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, now could you just do the ""my vagina"" thing for them? Could you just say ""my vagina""?"
1480,20,9,Heidi Turner,[Turns around and runs towards Elon Musk] They're out of sequence! I'll show you! [Cartman looks on in shock as she leaves]
1481,20,9,Eric Cartman,What the fuck is happening?
1482,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[picks up an empty glass] Do you remember, Mr. a-Skankhunt, when you and your little buddies trolled the entire country of a-Denmark?"
1483,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"And that was wrong, too. I certainly want to apologize for that."
1484,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[pours himself a glass of wine] That was certainly a display of the power of a-trolling, wasn't it.[turns around to face Gerald] But, what would be even more impressive?"
1485,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,I-I don't understand.
1486,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"What if you could troll the entire world? Somebody who could rise to political power through nothing more that pushing people's a-buttons and getting them all riled up, become the leader of...a Scandinavian country, perhaps, get them to listen to you when, actually...[speaks with an American accent] you're not even fucking Danish."
1487,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,No way.
1488,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,Use that country to create a machine that relies on the shittiness of people to fuck over other people and watch the whole world go completely batshit.
1489,20,9,,[Bedrager walks over to a microphone and starts talking over the P.A. system]
1490,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,[speaking with a Danish accent] Attention all a-TrollTrace workers. Please report to assembly hall one for a big announcement. [speaking with an American accent] Completely fool everyone [sits at table with Gerald] and keep your real intentions completely anonymous.
1491,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"You would--deliberately start World War III, let the people of Denmark die, set everyone on Earth against each other? Why?!"
1492,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"Because its freakin' hilarious! Getting a Scandinavian country to fight trolls by building a giant machine that actually shows everyone on Earth is kind of a troll, too?"
1493,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,That's not funny.
1494,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"That's not funny?! Don't be a fag, dude! That's real bro shit there. Sorry to step on your fucking dicks in the mouth and tit jokes, you amateur little pussy. Come on! Have some fucking balls!"
1495,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,You can't do this to people! It's not right!
1496,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[chuckles] Listen to you. [picks up microphone from under the table and starts talking in a Danish accent again] All right, everyone. Show's about to begin. [clicks on remote]"
1497,20,9,,"[Two Danes try to access a door with their access card, but are denied access and try manually opening the door with a crank handle. The wall panels slide back and show the remaining trolls in the Observatory room, who can also see the TrollTrace employees.]"
1498,20,9,Dick,What the fuck is going on?!
1499,20,9,,"[The trolls and TrollTrace employees look at each other, before an overhead project starts up and a countdown begins on the panels. The music video for ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" then starts up]"
1500,20,9,Music video,Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you.
1501,20,9,TrollTrace Employee,Uh-oh.
1502,20,9,,"[""Never Gonna Give You Up"" continues playing in the background]"
1503,20,9,Dick,Wow. That's pretty impressive.
1504,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,Waaiitt!!!
1505,20,9,,"[Bedrager smiles as the doors shut and he slides his access card to lock the doors, trapping Gerald inside. He tries to break the glass doors open as Bedrager happily walks away.]"
1506,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[standing in the hallway] Ike...It's time. [walks up to Ike] I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this, but its the only way now."
1507,20,9,Ike Broflovski,I know.
1508,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Just remember--I always loved you, little brother."
1509,20,9,Ike Broflovski,"I love you too, big brother."
1510,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Let's...just get this over with.
1511,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Mommy?
1512,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,Yes?
1513,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Suck my balls. You're a fat bitch. [runs off]
1514,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[angrily] Whhaaatt! [tosses book aside and jumps out of bed] You get back here, you little monster!"
1515,20,9,,[Ike hops down the staircase and runs into the kitchen with Sheila behind him]
1516,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[yelling] I have had it with you! Don't you run away from me, Ike! Who do you think you are?! [runs into the kitchen and sees Kyle standing there] Where is he?! Where is your brother?!"
1517,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,He's in the pantry.
1518,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[yelling] Don't you try and hide from me now! You are in big trouble now, Ike! [She continues on into the pantry before Kyle shuts the door on her and puts a chair against it] Whaaatt!  What, what! Kyle, you open this door right now. [starts to pound her fist on pantry door]"
1519,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ma. Mom, we are really sorry..."
1520,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[yelling] Open this door! [continues pounding on the door]
1521,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,But Ike and I have to do something and we have to be able to use the computers
1522,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[yelling] What,what?! No computers! Do not touch the computers! [continues pounding on the door]"
1523,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"We have to do this, Mom. Its the only thing that can save our family now."
1524,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[continues pounding on the door] You are done! You hear me?! You are both done! [screams]
1525,20,10,General Revaur,"Mr. President? Russians are scrambling bombers to attack Denmark. NATO wants to know how we intend to stop them. Mr. President?...Mr. President you can't just sit there with your ""stank face""."
1526,20,10,Mr Garrison,Iah-uhk-uh-I cain't?
1527,20,10,Military Officer,"The TrollTrace website is set to go online in less than fifteen minutes, the world is in complete chaos!"
1528,20,10,NSA Agent,"[From a nearby workstation.] Sir, someone is leading a coordinated cyber strike on the TrollTrace website."
1529,20,10,Mr Garrison,"[Joyously.] A cyber attack, well that's good! Where's it comin' from?"
1530,20,10,NSA Agent,"It could be Russian, we don't know. Whoever this troll is, he's pretty fucking hardcore sir."
1531,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, okay, Token? Token are you there?"
1532,20,10,Token Black,"I'm here, what's this about Kyle?"
1533,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't tell you dude, I just need your
Smokin'


help...Please, my life depends
Smokin'

 on it."
1534,20,10,Token Black,"Okay, okay sure.
I feel alright, mamma..."
1535,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, 
I'm not jokin', yeah

 I need you to tell me the worst thing I can say on the United Negro College Fund website to piss off black people."
1536,20,10,Token Black,What!?
1537,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Token, please! There's no time to explain!"
1538,20,10,Token Black,Beyonce ain't nothin' but a Taylor Swift ripoff.
1539,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,That helps thank you.
1540,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Tweek, Craig, I need you to get on the GLAAD website and respond to all the horrible shit I just said about gay people."
1541,20,10,Craig Tucker,Why'd you say horrible shit about gay people?
1542,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not important, just get on it and respond."
1543,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[To Tweek & Craig.] Hang on. [To Stan.] Stan! Finally. Dude I need everybody online now!
1544,20,10,Stan Marsh,For what?
1545,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, there's no time to explain, you gotta go out and get everybody, tell them to get on their computers, go!"
1546,20,10,Stan Marsh,[Pumped up] Okay!
1547,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, what's the worst possible thing you could say on a website for handicapped Syrian refugees?"
1548,20,10,Jimmy Valmer,Wuh-Wuh-Waddle back to Syria you desert-tard. [Jimmy smiles gleefully]
1549,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,You boys...better not be on that computaaaaaaah! I'll make you pay for this. You locked your mother in the pantry? I'll lock you in your rooms forevaaah.
1550,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,Skank
1551,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,Dildo?
1552,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skankhunt, can you hear me?"
1553,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yes! Yes, where are you?"
1554,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers.
1555,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,How long before the website goes online?
1556,20,10,Danish Worker,Less than ten mienutes.
1557,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,Oh God!
1558,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate."
1559,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skank, whoever's doing it is doing it from your account."
1560,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,My account?
1561,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people."
1562,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,[Proudly.] That's my boy!
1563,20,10,Female SpaceX Worker,"The core energy is completely stable, and very easy to reduce. It's the most massive energy source of its size we've ever seen."
1564,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"We've done it Elon, with this type of energy we can easily get mankind to Mars."
1565,20,10,Elon Musk,"This is amazing! And it's all thanks to you little girl, how did you get to be so smart?"
1566,20,10,Heidi Turner,I just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me.
1567,20,10,Elon Musk,"Well, c'mon, I wanna know everything about you."
1568,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them."
1569,20,10,Butters Stotch,Yep.
1570,20,10,Eric Cartman,"We have to tell someone the truth, Butters."
1571,20,10,Butters Stotch,Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars.
1572,20,10,Eric Cartman,"It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before."
1573,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Hey, you guys need anything? Water, Soda?"
1574,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?"
1575,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Sure, about what?"
1576,20,10,Eric Cartman,The end of our species.
1577,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, who else we got now, Kevin are you there, Kenny?"
1578,20,10,Kevin Stoley,"Ye-I, I typed in everything you told me to."
1579,20,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Me too dude, what's next?)"
1580,20,10,Ike Broflovski,"Kyle, I wanna help tooo."
1581,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say."
1582,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins.
1583,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Who are you?
1584,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you."
1585,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,O-- Okay?
1586,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too."
1587,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell is ""Trevor's Axiom""?"
1588,20,10,NSA Agent,Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling.
1589,20,10,NSA Agent,"It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C."
1590,20,10,NSA Agent,"Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity."
1591,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected."
1592,20,10,NSA Agent,"Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers..."
1593,20,10,General Revaur,[Interrupting] It could blow up the Internet before TrollTrace ever does substantial damage.
1594,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll."
1595,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars."
1596,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"You keep saying that, but not why."
1597,20,10,Butters Stotch,Because Eric knows the future.
1598,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,What are you talking about?
1599,20,10,Eric Cartman,"I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her."
1600,20,10,Eric Cartman,But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.
1601,20,10,Cartman Voiceover,"At first, you'll be super-happy, bouncing around the red sand."
1602,20,10,Eric Cartman,Everyone will be really nice.
1603,20,10,Female 1,Hi!
1604,20,10,Female 2,Hi!
1605,20,10,Eric Cartman,Hi!
1606,20,10,Eric Cartman,You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.
1607,20,10,Eric Cartman,"But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women."
1608,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Hmm, let's see"
1609,20,10,Eric Cartman,"And then you'll start to wonder, ""Where are all the other guys?"""
1610,20,10,Butters Stotch,[Whispering] Look underground.
1611,20,10,Eric Cartman,"And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for."
1612,20,10,Eric Cartman,What is this place?
1613,20,10,Eric Cartman,And that's when you'll learn the truth...
1614,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women."
1615,20,10,Eric Cartman,"They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes."
1616,20,10,Eric Cartman,"What?! No, no!"
1617,20,10,Eric Cartman,You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!
1618,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Nooooooo! No, no!"
1619,20,10,Female 3,Write jokes!
1620,20,10,Eric Cartman,No! No!
1621,20,10,Eric Cartman,"And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars."
1622,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"That's, That's ridiculous. Why would women need us to do that? They're just as funny as men."
1623,20,10,Eric Cartman,"If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on."
1624,20,10,Female SpaceX Employee,What?
1625,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,What?
1626,20,10,Eric Cartman,You have to help us stop this!
1627,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,[Frustrated.] Ah! God damn it!
1628,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,Skank! You still there?
1629,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"[He walks over to the TV.] Yeah, I'm here."
1630,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers."
1631,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,[He looks up at the monito.r] I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room.
1632,20,10,TrollTrace employee,"Oh, the key code to the conference room is 9..."
1633,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,[He runs over to the panel and presses 9.] Yeah...?
1634,20,10,TrollTrace employee,That's it. 9.
1635,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"[Frustrated.] Oh, for fuck's sake! [The panel light turns green, the door opens, and Gerald runs out.]"
1636,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[She's pounding the door.] Kyle! You better run if I get out of here! You better pray that--[The chair moves and she is begins to pry open the door with her hands.]-ah!
1637,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank. Skankhunt, are you there yet?"
1638,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I'm up with all the servers."
1639,20,10,TrollTrace employee,The first breaker should be there. Tell him to look for a large red lever.
1640,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, do you see a large red lever?"
1641,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"[notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever]"
1642,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,[He speaks over P.A. system.] Flip it off
1643,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,[He speaks over P.A. system.] That's good. Keep going Skankhunt.
1644,20,10,Ike Broflovski,You are all dumbass fuckwads.
1645,20,10,Ike Broflovski,"Lick my asshole, you Mexican bitch."
1646,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Ike!
1647,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Aah!
1648,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Yelling.] You dare lock me in the pantry, so you can play on your computer?!"
1649,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Mommy!
1650,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[Yelling.] You're gonna pay for what you've done!
1651,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Aah! [He runs out into the hallway.]
1652,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Kyle!
1653,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Ike!
1654,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[He throws down headset.] Shit!
1655,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Mommy got out!
1656,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[Panting.] You...! You helped turned your brother this way!
1657,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help--"
1658,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!
1659,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent"
1660,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[Yelling.] Do you think I'm stupid?!
1661,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Mom. You just don't know everything. [Kyle straps a vest around his chest.]"
1662,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"You both march out of here, right now!"
1663,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family"
1664,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Look, Elon, I'm just saying before we go any further, you might want to hear this kid out. [They both stop in front of Cartman and Butters.]"
1665,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Go on, tell Elon."
1666,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground."
1667,20,10,Elon Musk,For what?
1668,20,10,Eric Cartman,What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.
1669,20,10,Elon Musk,That's two things.
1670,20,10,Eric Cartman,They're pretty related.
1671,20,10,Elon Musk,Women don't need us for comedy. They can be just as funny as men. You should meet my girlfriend. She's really smart and really funny.
1672,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon."
1673,20,10,Butters Stotch,"I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it."
1674,20,10,Eric Cartman,"It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon."
1675,20,10,Eric Cartman,They can live without us. We can't live without them.
1676,20,10,Eric Cartman,"If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon--[He turns around and notices that Elon isn't there.] Elon?"
1677,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care."
1678,20,10,Ike Broflovski,You fat hooker.
1679,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out."
1680,20,10,Ike Broflovski,You clean your fucking mouth out.
1681,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now!"
1682,20,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town."
1683,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Shit!
1684,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hold on...
1685,20,10,Mr Garrison,Kyle?!
1686,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[Surprised.] Oh, hey, Mr. President"
1687,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?!"
1688,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Uh...what do you mean?
1689,20,10,Mr Garrison,Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you.
1690,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Surprised.] It is?
1691,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Keep up the good work. We're gonna take that big shitstorm of hate you're creating and amplify it. We'll try to create enough energy to blow up the whole fucking internet. [He gives Kyle a military salute] You're doing God's work, son. Keep it up."
1692,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[He gives Mr. Garrison a half-hearted military salute.] Thanks?
1693,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"Oh, no, you don't."
1694,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me."
1695,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,What? What? What?
1696,20,10,Laura Tucker,[She wipes her nose with a tissue.] The son of a bitch. He's such a bastard.
1697,20,10,Laura Tucker,When you marry someone and you think you know them...
1698,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,I don't know what you're talking about.
1699,20,10,Laura Tucker,TrollTrace. Its up and running. [She points to the laptop sitting on the table.]
1700,20,10,Laura Tucker,It can tell you anybody's Internet history. [She starts to walk to her couch.]
1701,20,10,Laura Tucker,I couldn't resist. I looked up my husband. [Sheila approaches the laptop.] The websites he's visited are just...disgusting!
1702,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,May I use this a moment?
1703,20,10,Laura Tucker,Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see.
1704,20,10,Eric Cartman,"What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars."
1705,20,10,Butters Stotch,"Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy."
1706,20,10,Eric Cartman,"If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat."
1707,20,10,Butters Stotch,What?!
1708,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! Where the fuck are you?!
1709,20,10,Butters Stotch,"Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you?"
1710,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,SpaceX? Why?!
1711,20,10,Butters Stotch,"Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it."
1712,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[He swivels his chair around.] Like...how ginormic of an energy source?
1713,20,10,Butters Stotch,Like enough to get humanity to Mars.
1714,20,10,Eric Cartman,[He is heard over Kyle's phone.] Is that Kyle?
1715,20,10,Eric Cartman,"[He takes Butters' phone.] Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now."
1716,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other."
1717,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, there's no more time! Have you found the last breaker?"
1718,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway.
1719,20,10,TrollTrace employee,That last breaker should be there
1720,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,Heading to it now!
1721,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,I'm ten steps ahead of you!
1722,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh?"
1723,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong!
1724,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to?
1725,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,It's completely heartless and malicious!
1726,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious?"
1727,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical.
1728,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,How is not satirical?
1729,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,There's nothing here.
1730,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Maybe Kyle was telling the truth. [She gets off of chair and walks towards Laura.]
1731,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me.
1732,20,10,Laura Tucker,About what?
1733,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"I accused Ike of...of...well, I can't really say, but this thing says that he's clean. I got to find my boys, Laura. Thank you so much. [She approaches the front door.]"
1734,20,10,Laura Tucker,Its not our kids we have to be worried about. [Sheila stops and turns to her.]
1735,20,10,Laura Tucker,"My husband was on three ""married-but-dating"" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends?"
1736,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy."
1737,20,10,Laura Tucker,"Sure, yeah. Respect. Nice of you to give him that. [She walks toward the laptop.]"
1738,20,10,Laura Tucker,"Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?"
1739,20,10,NSA Agent,There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can.
1740,20,10,Army General 2,"Mr. President, TrollTrace has been online for almost 15 minutes now. Its too late. We need to get you down to the bunker."
1741,20,10,Mr Garrison,Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good.
1742,20,10,Soldier,"[He holds the red telephone.] Mr. President, we have an urgent call from Kyle."
1743,20,10,Mr Garrison,"[He picks up the phone.] Sorry, Kyle. Looks like its not going to work."
1744,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[He types on his computer.] Mr. Garrison, I might have just found a lot more energy. Is there anyway the Pentagon can connect to SpaceX?"
1745,20,10,Mr Garrison,SpaceX? What the fuck is that?
1746,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[He types on his computer.] You know, the company trying to find new forms of energy, create jobs and get mankind to Mars."
1747,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Okay, that's dumb, but go on."
1748,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?"
1749,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter.
1750,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"No, but see, that's just nihilism."
1751,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"Oh, come on!"
1752,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,That is!
1753,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous!"
1754,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other.
1755,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire.
1756,20,10,Eric Cartman,Attention all SpaceX employees. [Elon Musk and his group turn away from the energy source chamber and look up.]
1757,20,10,Eric Cartman,Please evacuate the building immediately. [A group of men working on Tesla cars stop and hear the announcement.]
1758,20,10,Eric Cartman,We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. [Heidi walks over to Cartman from behind.]
1759,20,10,Eric Cartman,"The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can. [He notices Heidi.] Ah! [He puts the microphone away.] Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up?"
1760,20,10,Heidi Turner,There's a bomb threat?
1761,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. [He grabs Heidi and runs with her to the energy source chamber before she stops him.]"
1762,20,10,Heidi Turner,"Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately."
1763,20,10,Eric Cartman,Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.
1764,20,10,Heidi Turner,Did I do something wrong?
1765,20,10,Eric Cartman,"[He grabs Heidi's hands.] No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? [He then turns her away, so she doesn't see what's going on with the chamber.]"
1766,20,10,Heidi Turner,"You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh?"
1767,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on."
1768,20,10,Heidi Turner,"Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings."
1769,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. [He puts his arm around her while looking back at the guys.]"
1770,20,10,Eric Cartman,Now come on we got to get outside.
1771,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,I shouldn't do this.
1772,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true. [He turns around.]"
1773,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people. [Bedrager looks down, agreeing with Gerald.]"
1774,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have. [He slowly shuffles forward towards Bedrager.]"
1775,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself. [He stops a few inches from Bedrager.] With only one minor difference."
1776,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,Noooooo!!!
1777,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!"
1778,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!
1779,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. President, do it!"
1780,20,10,Mr Garrison,Reroute the internet through SpaceX!.
1781,20,10,Pentagon Employee,Rerouting now!
1782,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[She stares at the black screen.] What the hell just happened?!
1783,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?."
1784,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?"
1785,20,10,Heidi Turner,"Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh?"
1786,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares."
1787,20,10,Heidi Turner,"Well, what do you mean?"
1788,20,10,Eric Cartman,It was a joke.
1789,20,10,Kyle voiceover,"And so, life goes on."
1790,20,10,Kyle voiceover,The end of civilization didn't happen.
1791,20,10,Kyle voiceover,A massive electrical pulse completely erased the internet.
1792,20,10,Kyle voiceover,We've been given a second chance.
1793,20,10,Kyle voiceover,A mulligan.
1794,20,10,Kyle voiceover,"Anything we might be ashamed of, gone forever."
1795,20,10,Kyle voiceover,Maybe now boys and girls can learn to respect each other again.
1796,20,10,Kyle voiceover,Realize how careful our online lives have to be.
1797,20,10,Kyle voiceover,"Because we've all seen what happens when the Twitters, Facebook and trolls decide our reality."
1798,20,10,Kyle voiceover,"Now that we've been given this second chance, it is up to all of us to see what we do with it."
1799,20,10,News Anchor,"And the first new e-mail since the internet was erased was successfully went out at 6 a.m. today. The honor went to a Mr. Dave Beckett of Boca Raton, Florida."
1800,20,10,News Reporter,"Mr. Beckett, you had the honor of being the first person to socialize on the new internet. Could you tell us what you did?"
1801,20,10,Dave Beckett,"Well, I sent an e-mail with a photo to my old friend, Thomas Winger, up in Connecticut."
1802,20,10,News Reporter,And what you did say to Mr. Winger?
1803,20,10,Dave Beckett,"[He pauses.] I showed him my dick, called him a fag."
