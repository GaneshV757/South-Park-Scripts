20,18,1,Registrar,"I told you, you just have to be really original with with your company name. There's a lot of startup company these days. [the boys look at each other]"
21,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!"
22,18,1,Registrar,That's available! Congratulations!
23,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
24,18,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name."
25,18,1,Butters Stotch,Man this sucks!
26,18,1,Randy Marsh,"[opens the door and peeks in] Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?"
27,18,1,Stan Marsh,"No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company."
28,18,1,Randy Marsh,A startup company? A company that does what?
29,18,1,Stan Marsh,"No, we don't wanna do anything."
30,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company."
31,18,1,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken."
32,18,1,Randy Marsh,"Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name."
33,18,1,Stan Marsh,"...Nnnno, there isn't. [turns back to his computer and fleshes out the project]"
34,18,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys! [runs up to Stan's door and enters the house. He runs into Stan's room] You guys, I've got it!"
35,18,1,Stan Marsh,What?
36,18,1,Eric Cartman,It's the greatest startup company name EVER! [Kyle and Stan move in closer to Cartman]
37,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?! Tell us!
38,18,1,Eric Cartman,Washington. Redskins. [Kyle and Stan look at each other]
39,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,Washington Redskins?
40,18,1,Eric Cartman,It's sooo sweet!
41,18,1,Stan Marsh,"I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman."
42,18,1,Eric Cartman,"It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!"
43,18,1,Stan Marsh,[lowers his head and strokes his chin] Washington Redskins. [raises his head] I like it!
44,18,1,Kenny McCormick,(Me too!)
45,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
46,18,1,Eric Cartman,Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
47,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal."
48,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!"
49,18,1,Stan Marsh,[walks up to Kyle] You alright dude?
50,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original"
51,18,1,Eric Cartman,"[climbs down the ladder and joins Stan and Kyle] It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken."
52,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for."
53,18,1,Eric Cartman,"We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys! [walks up to an easel with a 4 Point Plan on it] Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down."
54,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
55,18,1,Butters Stotch,[at the computer] We already got a dollar!
56,18,1,Stan Marsh,What?! [Cartman walks up to Butters]
57,18,1,Butters Stotch,One dollar pledge!
58,18,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yahoo!) [begins to dance]
59,18,1,Eric Cartman,"I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention!"
60,18,1,Butters Stotch,Another two dollars!
61,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,No way!
62,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Sittin' on our asses, here we come!"
63,18,1,News 4 Anchor,"Another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the Internet. They're a company that does absolutely nothing, and they're called, the Washington Redskins. [the page loads and someone is scrolling through it] The Redskins started as what appeared to be some kind of adolescent prank, but almost overnight it has become one of the most heavily funded projects on Kickstarter. [scroll over, next is a teen boy] Why did you give five dollars to the Washington Redskins Kickstarter?"
64,18,1,Teen Boy,"I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny."
65,18,1,Eric Cartman,"[on a video on the Kickstarter site] By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge."
66,18,1,News 4 Anchor,"It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal."
67,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself. [Butters walks across the room] Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye."
68,18,1,Businessman,[walks in with two other men] You are Eric Cartman?
69,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Yes, I know."
70,18,1,Dan Snyder,My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
71,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, cool. Please take a seat."
72,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Thank you, but I will stand."
73,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Nice, I like that."
74,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization."
75,18,1,Eric Cartman,Stop? But why?
76,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!"
77,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually. [phone rings, Eric reacts] Um, Butters, could you get that?"
78,18,1,Butters Stotch,"[next to the phone, answers it. Stan is on his iPhone] Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself."
79,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization ""The Washington Redskins"", its offensive to us?"
80,18,1,Eric Cartman,How is it offensive?
81,18,1,Redskins Coach,"How is it offensive?! Jesus, what-?!"
82,18,1,Dan Snyder,"We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!"
83,18,1,Redskins Coach,Makes us feel like a joke
84,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. [grins, knowing that's not the reason.]"
85,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?"
86,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. [the men, dejected, turn and walk out the door]"
87,18,1,Flight attendant,"All around the world, people are saying they are inspired by the Washington Redskins. The Internet startup company has raised so much money in Kickstarter that now, more groups are doing the same."
88,18,1,Reporter,[a reporter speaks as Snyder looks over hit masses pool] More news on the Washington Redskins tonight. Their defiant. F-You attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group ISIS. The terrorists said they admire the Washington Redskins and want to try it and follow their business model.
89,18,1,A caller,"[a newspaper falls out of a car, and Snyder picks it up and reads it] Well, let's not forget, Marsha that there's a people here, okay, who are not happy about the use of the name, the Football Washington Redskins!"
90,18,1,Woman,"Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? [he turns to the camera and sheds a tear, in the manner of Indian Eyes Cody (Espera Oscar de Corti)]"
91,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!"
92,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters with Stan] Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them."
93,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!"
94,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
95,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about! [pounds the desk a couple of times.] Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are! [pound] Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!"
96,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,That's the Catholic Church!
97,18,1,Eric Cartman,"NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!"
98,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,That's the NFL!
99,18,1,Eric Cartman,"It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters."
100,18,1,Butters Stotch,[gasps] Oh no!
101,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking."
102,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!"
103,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe I'll start my own company.
104,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!"""
105,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,I don't want to! It's a stupid name! [eerie music plays for a few seconds]
106,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?"
107,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
108,18,1,Eric Cartman,Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
109,18,1,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either."
110,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. [Kyle and Stan walk out the door. Butters begins to follow them, but stops in his tracks.]"
111,18,1,Butters Stotch,"Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here."
112,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!"
113,18,1,Goodell,"[sound clips come out of his mouth, indicating he's a robot] I will get it right, and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that."
114,18,1,Dan Snyder,What?!
115,18,1,Goodell,We will continue to identify and add expertise to our team.
116,18,1,Dan Snyder,That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?!
117,18,1,Goodell,Everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month.
118,18,1,Dan Snyder,Ugh! This thing is broken!
119,18,1,Goodell,"We can add... and we will do more, do more, do more [winds down and continues in a high pitch]"
120,18,1,Dan Snyder,Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!
121,18,1,Dan Snyder,And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!
122,18,1,Jim Irsay,"Dan, you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff. Let the Goodell-bot do it."
123,18,1,Dan Snyder,The stupid thing isn't working!
124,18,1,Goodell,[starts up again] I will get it right.
125,18,1,Steve Bischiotti,"Man, that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it."
126,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name."
127,18,1,Paul Allen,Did you tell them we're about honor and integrity?
128,18,1,Alex Spanos,"If the Goodell bot is broken, we must stay out of it more than even usual!"
129,18,1,Dan Snyder,And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?
130,18,1,Jerry Jones,My eyes aren't too far apart!
131,18,1,Paul Allen,"If we get them to change their logo, will it make you happy?"
132,18,1,Dan Snyder,Uh I guess we can live with that.
133,18,1,Jim Irsay,Then it is decided! We will make them change their logo. Begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes NOW
134,18,1,Owners,Go! [all screens go blank]
135,18,1,Dan Snyder,Thank God!
136,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with. [An image of the office appears, with the new changes] To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting. [a pair of tits and male genitalia are added to the original logo, to much cheer and applause] Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins! [cheering and applause]"
137,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!"
138,18,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah...
139,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You okay, bro?"
140,18,1,Stan Marsh,"I just... never saw myself owning a company called ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."""
141,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Give it time, it'll grow on you."
142,18,1,Stan Marsh,"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?"
143,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!"
144,18,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title."
145,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,Well whattaya mean?
146,18,1,Stan Marsh,"I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it."
147,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back. [Stan slowly walks to the door, then turns around]"
148,18,1,Stan Marsh,"Good luck with your company, dude."
149,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Good luck with yours. [Stan leaves and closes the door]
150,18,1,Employee,"It's just... incredible, Harry. Everyone is using Kickstarter for everything!"
151,18,1,"Kickstarter Employees 1 and 2, and Harry","And for every project funded, we get 5%."
152,18,1,Employee,"It's like, we don't even have to do anything and we just make money."
153,18,1,"Kickstarter Employees 1 and 2, and Harry","Sitting on our asses, here we come."
154,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Caw-CAW, Caw-CAW. [his football team rises from the bushes and gather behind him] HooHOO, hoohooHOO. [other players appear and they all move in. A player sneaks past a Kickstarter employee]"
155,18,1,Employee 2,"[lowers his cup] Huh? [goes back to sipping coffee. Two more players sneak past him, and #88 tackles him moments later. Number 28 tackles another employee. Pretty soon all the employees are targeted. Two players make it to the servers and head-butt them, causing damage to them. Number 48 kicks the head off one of the employees. An uninjured female waits for an elevator. The doors open, she goes in, and number 28 spooks her. She screams. Later, Kickstarter is in flames]"
156,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Goooood morning, guys!"
157,18,1,Butters Stotch,Happy Deadline Day!
158,18,1,Eric Cartman,"We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!"
159,18,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!"
160,18,1,Eric Cartman,"[tries to visit his page, but it's not coming up] What the hell? Can't find the server? [tries again] Kickstarter.com! [not found] Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!"
161,18,1,Butters Stotch,It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
162,18,1,Kenny McCormick,(What?!)
163,18,1,Butters Stotch,Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
164,18,1,Eric Cartman,What?!
165,18,1,Butters Stotch,Somebody killed Kickstarter!
166,18,1,Eric Cartman,Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?! [gasps] Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
167,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter. [Cartman barges in with Butters and Kenny in tow]"
168,18,1,Eric Cartman,You song of a bitch!
169,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
170,18,1,Eric Cartman,You broke Kickstarter!
171,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I just can't get it to load."
172,18,1,Eric Cartman,Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
173,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
174,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, somebody did!"
175,18,1,Stan Marsh,"It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here. [walks up to the boys] Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other."
176,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,He's right. We should do a merger.
177,18,1,Eric Cartman,"[shocked] A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! [begins walking out the door]"
178,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes we do! We have a sweet name. [Cartman turns around] I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it."
179,18,1,Eric Cartman,[steps forward] It is really sweet.
180,18,1,Stan Marsh,"And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,"
181,18,1,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!"
182,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Whattaya say, Cartman?"
183,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks! [the cheering and applause die down] How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it."
184,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[joins Cartman onstage] When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself. [The modified Redskin logo fades to a single line saying ""GO FUND YOURSELF""] And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%."
185,18,1,Eric Cartman,"You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. [The neo logo comes up - it's two of the old logo, with titties and balls and penises, one taking the other from behind. This receives cheers and applause]"
186,18,1,Cartman and Kyle,Go Redskins!
187,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,"A beautiful night in Arlington, Texas as the Dallas Cowboys get set to take on the Washington Redskins. That is, of course, Washington Redskins the football team, not Washington Redskins, the audacious crowd-funding company."
188,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,"Yeah, and if you ask me, the Redskins are a scam."
189,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,"You're talking about the crowd-funding company- Redskins, right?"
190,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,That's right. An-and now you've got terrorist groups like ISIS using the Redskins to raise their money. I-I don't like what the Redskins are doing.
191,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,Those Redskins
192,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,"Yeah, whatever."
193,18,1,35 - fictional,It's over. Our name has been reduced to a stereotype and a joke.
194,18,1,59 - fictional,"Yeah, let's just go home."
195,18,1,Dan Snyder,"No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points."
196,18,1,92 - Chris Baker,"Yeah, but I just feel pretty stupid wearing this now."
197,18,1,72 - Stephen Bowen,Yeah.
198,18,1,35 - fictional,"Come on, guys."
199,18,1,"8 - Kirk Cousins
35 - fictional
59 - fictional
72 - Stephen Bowen
92 - Chris Baker",Where will we go? What will we do? [and with that his players desert him]
200,18,1,Dan Snyder,"Don't let them break you! Don't let them win! [as kickoff approaches, a Native American drumbeat starts up]"
201,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,"And the Cowboys are still set to kick off, but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to."
202,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,"Yeah, and Jerry Jones must be happy this means a forfeit, another win for the Cowboys. [with his bright chameleon eyes and a woman popping up from between his legs, he must indeed be happy. Mellow Native American music joins the drumbeat]"
203,18,1,Cowboys Announcer and Commentator,"Wait a minute, it appears a lone Redskin is making his way out of the locker room. [Dan Snyder comes out, not in uniform, but willing to face down the Cowboys. The referee blows the whistle and the game starts.] The Cowboys kick it off. [Snyder catches it, but the Cowboys quickly pile up on him, then get off]"
204,18,1,Dan Snyder,"[dusts himself off] Hut! Hut Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off] Hut hut hut. Hut Hut Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off. He's quite beat up now] Hut. Hut hut hut. Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. The crowd finally reacts]"
205,18,1,Crowd,Oh!
206,18,1,Fan wearing 3,Just stay down! For the love of God!
207,18,1,Dan Snyder,"[barely able to move] Hut hut. Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off]"
208,18,1,Fan wearing 74,Stop! Make it stop!
209,18,1,Fan wearing 82,Just stay down!
210,18,1,Another fan,Please!
211,18,1,Fan wearing a blue star,Just make him stay down!
212,18,1,Other fans,Go Redskins! Go Redskins!
213,18,1,Stan Marsh,"Boy, this is the life, huh guys?"
214,18,1,Butters Stotch,We finally did it!
215,18,1,Eric Cartman,I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. [a brick flies in through a window and shards flow into the room]
216,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,What the heck is that? [the boys leave the building to investigate]
217,18,1,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, whoa! What?"
218,18,1,Protestor 1,Change your name!
219,18,1,Protestor 2,It doesn't belong in today's society!
220,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,Change our name?
221,18,1,Stan Marsh,But you all thought our name was sweet.
222,18,1,Protestor 3,There's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated. A once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by Cowboys in a defiant last stand!
223,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,When was that?
224,18,1,Protestor 4,Last night.
225,18,1,Protestor 5,"Until you change your name, we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you."
226,18,1,ISIS Spokesman,That's right! ISIS will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising!
227,18,1,Crowd,Yeah! Alright!
228,18,1,Protestor 1,"Good for you, ISIS!"
229,18,1,Kyle Broflovski,Well what the hell do we do?
230,18,1,Eric Cartman,"[sighs and his voice drops] I guess we gotta go back to school. [they boys turn left and walk away, their heads hanging down. The protesters keep cheering until they're gone.]"
231,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,Hey guys!
232,18,2,Stan Marsh,Morning!
233,18,2,Eric Cartman,"How's it going, everybody?"
234,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Sup, Jason? [Jason turns and walks away angrily]"
235,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey dude. Sup? [they encounter Token, Craig, and Jimmy.]"
236,18,2,Craig Tucker,What are you guys doing here?
237,18,2,Eric Cartman,What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
238,18,2,Jimmy Valmer,I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
239,18,2,Token Black,"Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags."
240,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out."
241,18,2,Craig Tucker,But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
242,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-"
243,18,2,Craig Tucker,"[keeps pressing] You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves."
244,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,We were- trying to be funny.
245,18,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle. [Token, Craig and Jimmy split up, then everyone else goes their separate ways. Moments later, Wendy is shown at her locker]"
246,18,2,Stan Marsh,[walks up] Hey Wendy.
247,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,You're... back?
248,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out."
249,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[sarcastic] Oh wow, I'm shocked."
250,18,2,Stan Marsh,"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie."
251,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be ""free to chase your dreams""."
252,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing."
253,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be [does air quotes] ""dripping in bitches""?!"
254,18,2,Stan Marsh,Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? [Wendy closes her locker and faces him]
255,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! [turns around and walks away]"
256,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at us."
257,18,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)"
258,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?"
259,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?"
260,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school."
261,18,2,Pricipal Victoria,"All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?"
262,18,2,Woman,Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
263,18,2,Mr Adler,"Awww, do we need Mackey here?"
264,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing."
265,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Well, you have to admit he does look a little better."
266,18,2,Mr Adler,He doesn't look any different to me.
267,18,2,Principal Victoria,"In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?"
268,18,2,Mr Garrison,It's just the new diet fad! [a door opens]
269,18,2,Mr Mackey,"Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?"
270,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now."
271,18,2,Mr Mackey,I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
272,18,2,Mr Garrison,"[exasperated, face in his hands] Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?"
273,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off."
274,18,2,Mr Mackey,"That's probably gluten, m'kay?"
275,18,2,Coach,"Oh, God!"
276,18,2,Mr Mackey,"Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,"
277,18,2,Mr Garrison,I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
278,18,2,Mr Mackey,"See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off."
279,18,2,Principal Victoria,[surprized and interested] Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
280,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go."
281,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
282,18,2,Kenny McCormick,(Right. What the fuck is going on?)
283,18,2,Eric Cartman,"You know what we gotta do, guys? [gets off the bleachers] We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party"
284,18,2,Kenny McCormick,(A party?!)
285,18,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
286,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever."
287,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them."
288,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[joins him on the floor] Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us."
289,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for..."
290,18,2,Stan Marsh,[joins them on the floor] For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
291,18,2,Eric Cartman,What?
292,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go."
293,18,2,Eric Cartman,We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
294,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?"
295,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something."
296,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live."
297,18,2,Kenny McCormick,(This will be awesome!)
298,18,2,Eric Cartman,So who do we throw the party for?
299,18,2,Stan Marsh,"What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. [Pink's ""Get This Party Started"" begins to play, which serves as transitional music to the next scene]"
300,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, that was ""Get This Party Started"" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?"
301,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, it's going to be this weekend."
302,18,2,Eric Cartman,"You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time."
303,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?"
304,18,2,Eric Cartman,"You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson."
305,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him."
306,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?"
307,18,2,Scott Malkinson,I actually have plans this weekend.
308,18,2,Eric Cartman,"""I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."""
309,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?"
310,18,2,Craig Tucker,Are you guys making this up?
311,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!"
312,18,2,Craig Tucker,All the pizza we can eat?
313,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Believe it, dude."
314,18,2,Craig Tucker,"All right, this better be good."
315,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!"
316,18,2,Stan Marsh,Sweet!
317,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Next caller, what's your question?"
318,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?"
319,18,2,Stan Marsh,Excuse me?
320,18,2,Principal Victoria,"Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us."
321,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?"
322,18,2,Mark (voice only),"Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like ""Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"""
323,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?"
324,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face."
325,18,2,Eric Cartman,What the hell is gluten?
326,18,2,John Garner,"Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight."
327,18,2,Randy Marsh,[To Gerald] Make your dick fly off?
328,18,2,John Garner,"People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say ""Well there's fat in butter too,"" but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?"
329,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Yes, thank you!"
330,18,2,John Garner,"Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. [holds up a stalk of wheat]. Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough. [grabs a wad of dough] Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy. [puts the dough into a special washer. The extract going through a distillation process] Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein."
331,18,2,Mr Mackey,Then eat it!
332,18,2,John Garner,Excuse me?
333,18,2,Mr Mackey,"If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?"
334,18,2,John Garner,"[looks at the gluten, then at the audience, then moves the gluten to his lips] Yeah. Alright. [sips it down] Dup, dup. [his body contorts as he groans. Everyone in the audience begins to panic. He shows signs of burning up, and his groin begins to set off electrical sparks. His penis wriggles out of there and soon launches itself.]"
335,18,2,Mr Mackey,"Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. [people begin to leave the community center. The penis escapes and comes back to knock a man down]"
336,18,2,Stephen Stotch,[stops] Oh my God! These people don't even know! [faces the pizza joint] Hurry! You gotta go!
337,18,2,Mr Garrison,"[stops as well] Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there! [inside, two workers just stand around behind the counter] Get out of there!"
338,18,2,Stephen Stotch,Get out! You're not safe!
339,18,2,Mr Garrison,You gotta get out!
340,18,2,Stephen Stotch,Hurry! You gotta go!
341,18,2,Randy Marsh,What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
342,18,2,Sharon Marsh,Yes!
343,18,2,Randy Marsh,Hamburger Helper?
344,18,2,Sharon Marsh,That's all gluten!
345,18,2,Randy Marsh,"There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!"
346,18,2,Sharon Marsh,"Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having."
347,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!"
348,18,2,Sharon Marsh,"It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!"
349,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Wait, wait, ah I might need those."
350,18,2,Randy Marsh,"This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!"
351,18,2,Sharon Marsh,Don't forget the freezer!
352,18,2,Randy Marsh,Oh God! [now clearing the freezer] Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
353,18,2,Sharon Marsh,I don't know! Look at the ingredients!
354,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!"
355,18,2,Sharon Marsh,"All right, that's all of it!"
356,18,2,Randy Marsh,"You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!"
357,18,2,Sharon Marsh,"I can get both of these, yeah!"
358,18,2,Randy Marsh,"All right, come on! [a loaf of whole wheat sandwich bread falls out. Moments later, Randy comes back for it, then leaves again]"
359,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Cartman.
360,18,2,Eric Cartman,KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
361,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, calm down."
362,18,2,Eric Cartman,"THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!"
363,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,Who took all the pizza and the cake? [begins to notice flickering lights outside his window and hears an approaching crowd. All the gluten-tainted food that people have been bagging is being thrown into a bonfire] What the hell?
364,18,2,Eric Cartman,KYYYLE!
365,18,2,Mr Garrison,"Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!"
366,18,2,Farmer,What are you doing to my farm?!?
367,18,2,Randy Marsh,You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! [knocks him down with a right punch to the right cheek]
368,18,2,Tom Vilsack,There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!
369,18,2,Researcher,"We're working as fast as we can, sir."
370,18,2,Tom Vilsack,[sighs loudly] Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction?
371,18,2,Researcher,"[they stop by a rat cage] We gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago. You can see it already having a negative effect. [the rat is having an arousal it can't control. It flips over on its back and its penis wriggles out, and shoots off. The rat dies.]"
372,18,2,Tom Vilsack,We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?
373,18,2,Researcher,No. We believe now that that's poppycock.
374,18,2,Tom Vilsack,"[to everyone on the floor] All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis! [turns left and leaves. Another rat in the background loses its penis and dies.]"
375,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up."
376,18,2,Eric Cartman,What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
377,18,2,Stan Marsh,We can't let our party suck.
378,18,2,Eric Cartman,What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
379,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?"
380,18,2,Stan Marsh,"[looks down, then] I'll be back. [turns and leaves]"
381,18,2,Eric Cartman,You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
382,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up."
383,18,2,Eric Cartman,"[turns to his right side] There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse."
384,18,2,Randy Marsh,Yes?
385,18,2,Worker 1,"Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?"
386,18,2,Randy Marsh,Gluten expohn... oh not here!
387,18,2,Worker 2,Can we come in please?
388,18,2,Randy Marsh,Wuh sure! [shows them in. They enter and their gluten meters crackle as they go around the house]
389,18,2,Sharon Marsh,[coming down the stairs] What's going on? [one of the workers stops at the kitchen wastebasket and pulls out a pair of tongs. He rifles through the trash can with it and pulls out a Pabst Blue Ribbon can]
390,18,2,Randy Marsh,Well that's just a beer.
391,18,2,Worker 1,Oh Jesus.
392,18,2,Shelly Marsh,"BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!"
393,18,2,Randy Marsh,"[to Shelly] Shuut up, [to the worker] beer is bad for you?!"
394,18,2,Worker 2,"We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me."
395,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?"
396,18,2,Worker 1,We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.
397,18,2,Randy Marsh,No! Not Papa John's. [shakes his head] I don't wanna go to Papa John's! [shakes his head more violently] YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
398,18,2,Randy Marsh,How long do I have to stay here?!
399,18,2,Soldier,"Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir."
400,18,2,Randy Marsh,What am I supposed to eat?
401,18,2,Soldier,"It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings. [the soldier and the worker walk away]"
402,18,2,A Quarantine,How'd you get exposed? [it's a blond man on the floor] Bagels? Gravy?
403,18,2,Randy Marsh,Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
404,18,2,Mr Garrison,"There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce. [his voice grows soft] Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce."
405,18,2,Jeff White,"We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain."
406,18,2,Tom Vilsack,And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?
407,18,2,Researcher,"[approaches with an open laptop] We've been running simulations, but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics. Here, look. This is what we've been recommending for the past three years. [Shown is a food tray with dish and cup on it. The dish has larger portions for veggies and grains, smaller portions for fruits and proteins, and the cup is dairy, off to the side with the smallest portion] Five basic food groups, not four. We were wrong about that. We now realize, of course, that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison [a skull and crossbones appears over the grains]. Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers."
408,18,2,Agent,"Sir, the feds are here."
409,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Oh shit!
410,18,2,FDA Agent 1,Tom Vilsack?
411,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Yes?
412,18,2,Michael Taylor,"Michael Taylor, FDA."
413,18,2,Tom Vilsack,"Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem."
414,18,2,Michael Taylor,Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!
415,18,2,Stan Marsh,Dad? Dad!
416,18,2,Randy Marsh,[appears through a window] Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
417,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?"
418,18,2,Randy Marsh,"I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?"
419,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?"
420,18,2,Randy Marsh,"How's your mom? Your, your sister?"
421,18,2,Soldier 2,"[appears next to him and begins tugging at him] This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go."
422,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Nonono, not yet. DAD!"
423,18,2,Randy Marsh,"That's my son, you bastard!"
424,18,2,Soldier 2,"I'm sorry, all right?"
425,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!"
426,18,2,Randy Marsh,Staaan!
427,18,2,Stan Marsh,Let me talk to my dad! [the soldier finally hauls him away]
428,18,2,Randy Marsh,Staaaaaaan!
429,18,2,Craig Tucker,You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
430,18,2,Token Black,"Come on guys, let's go!"
431,18,2,Jimmy Valmer,"No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! [the voices mount and soon he's lifted out of bed as one last kid says ""What a loser"" which echoes and fades away. He finds himself in bayou territory]"
432,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"Hello, Eric. [he sees her, on a porch, with a plate of pancakes] Come on over here, sugar."
433,18,2,Eric Cartman,Aunt Jemima. [stands up and walks over]
434,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way."
435,18,2,Eric Cartman,"I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima."
436,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign."
437,18,2,Eric Cartman,I don't even know what that means.
438,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"When you're stuck, look to the pyramids."
439,18,2,Eric Cartman,Are you going to eat those pancakes?
440,18,2,Aunt Jemima,"They've got it wrong, child! [suddenly the scenery changes to the pyramids at Giza. Her voice takes on a cosmic tone, and Cartman spins in place] The world is upside down."
441,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Oooo, trippy..."
442,18,2,Aunt Jemima,Tell then they've got's it backwards!
443,18,2,Eric Cartman,"They've got what backward? [everything vanishes into a gray field, then a golden triangle appears, then shatters. A kaleidoscope of kids appears, taunting him. Aunt Jemima's face shatters, revealing the golden triangle.]"
444,18,2,Eric Cartman,"[he falls through his dream, surrounded by everything that has gluten in it] Noooo... [and suddenly wakes up] Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes."
445,18,2,Randy Marsh,You can't just keep us in here!
446,18,2,Mr Garrison,[clanging] We're out. [holds up an empty tray] We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
447,18,2,Blond,"[looks outside, then] They're just gonna let us starve to death?"
448,18,2,Randy Marsh,They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. [buries his face in his hands]
449,18,2,Blond,"Well then, I guess I might as well eat! [stands up and walks towards the storage room]"
450,18,2,Mr Garrison,"There's nothing left, I told you."
451,18,2,Blond,There's plenty of pizza dough.
452,18,2,Randy Marsh,Are you crazy?
453,18,2,Blond,I'm crazy hungry! [takes a wad of dough and begins eating it] Oh... Oh... Fuck it's so good. [Randy and Mr. Garrison wait for the other shoe to drop] I want more! ...it's been so long! [gets more dough and eats voraciously]
454,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, you... [the blond stops] but... you're okay."
455,18,2,Blond,"You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!"
456,18,2,Mr Garrison,A setup? But by who?
457,18,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out."
458,18,2,Blond,"Maybe Papa John can help us. If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can- [his penis quickly flies off and he dies]"
459,18,2,Randy Marsh,Ng-oh. [snaps his fingers. He and Garrison go find seats]
460,18,2,Stan Marsh,"There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have."
461,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller."
462,18,2,Craig Tucker,I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
463,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!"
464,18,2,Craig Tucker,"Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?"
465,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead."
466,18,2,Jamie (voice only),It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!
467,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air."
468,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?"
469,18,2,Stan Marsh,"I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-"
470,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
471,18,2,Scott Malkinson,"That is correct, yes, I do."
472,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?"
473,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus Christ, dude."
474,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now..."
475,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!"
476,18,2,Stan Marsh,"We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!"
477,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,Thought so. [hangs up. Stan lets his head fall on the table]
478,18,2,WSPIC DJ,"Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?"
479,18,2,Eric Cartman,KYYYLE!
480,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman?
481,18,2,Eric Cartman,"KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!"
482,18,2,Tom Vilsack,It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!
483,18,2,Jeff White,Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.
484,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Who is this?
485,18,2,Eric Cartman,My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
486,18,2,Tom Vilsack,"The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure? [to the floor] Bring up the pyramid! [a programmer gets on it. An image comes up on screen, showing four food groups in four layers inside a pyramid. Grains take the bottom, widest layer, followed by fruits and vegetables, meat and dairy, and fats and oils narrowing to a point at the top]"
487,18,2,Eric Cartman,"What, what is it? What is it for?"
488,18,2,Tom Vilsack,We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.
489,18,2,Programmer,"Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved."
490,18,2,Tom Vilsack,The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
491,18,2,Eric Cartman,It's upside down.
492,18,2,Tom Vilsack,What?
493,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Sir, the pyramid is upside down."
494,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Turn the pyramid upside down.
495,18,2,Programmer 2,You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-
496,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Flip the damned food pyramid!
497,18,2,Michael Taylor,This is NOT FDA-approved!
498,18,2,Tom Vilsack,It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT! [the programmers get on it]
499,18,2,Programmer 3,"Sir, we've got a match."
500,18,2,Programmer 4,Nutrition is stabilizing!
501,18,2,Programmer 5,"We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir! [everyone cheers]"
502,18,2,Tom Vilsack,Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.
503,18,2,Craig Tucker,"[with butter on a stick] Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party."
504,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man."
505,18,2,Scott Malkinson,[approaches with a plate of butter on a stick] Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
506,18,2,Kyle Broflovski,"We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. [Scott walks away]"
507,18,2,Tom Vilsack,"We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again."
508,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like."
509,18,2,Tom Vilsack,We're gonna get a better view of the stage.
510,18,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. [takes a couple of steps and notices the ghost of Aunt Jemima over a fence. He waves at her. She waves back.]"
511,18,2,Jeff White,Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!
512,18,2,Clyde Donovan,I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
513,18,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, she isn't as hot in person."
514,18,2,Randy Marsh,"[dressed up as Lorde] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah."
515,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?"
516,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off."
517,18,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me."
518,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You're so transparent, Stan."
519,18,2,Stan Marsh,What does that mean?
520,18,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You wanna dance? [he looks back at her, smiles, and goes to dance with her.]"
521,18,2,Randy Marsh,"We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah."
522,18,3,Eric Cartman,"[thinking] Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago. [looks down at Stan's feet, than at Kyle's] Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all. [Stan notices and looks. Cartman notices Stan and shoves his hand further into his pocket. Stan looks at Cartman and steps away from him.] I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! [Kyle notices Cartman's anger]"
523,18,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Are you okay, Cartman?"
524,18,3,Eric Cartman,"[brightens up] Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle? [settles into angry funk again and thinks] They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time. [Kyle and Kenny look at each other, then they look at Cartman] We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess."
525,18,3,Butters Stotch,"[at the urinal, pants down] Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more."
526,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Good for you. [tries to get into the first stall, but finds it locked]"
527,18,3,Butters Stotch,[looks over] I think someone's in there.
528,18,3,Eric Cartman,No! God damn it no! [pounds on the door] Who's takin' a shit?!
529,18,3,Craig Tucker,Occupied.
530,18,3,Eric Cartman,"I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!"
531,18,3,Craig Tucker,You can't call dibs on a toilet.
532,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Son of a bitch! [moves on to Stall 2, tries to open it, and finds it locked too.] Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!"
533,18,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Then don't eat 14 Eggo waffles for lunch, fatass!"
534,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Alright, that does it! [turns around and walks toward the door] I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be [throws his magazines to the floor] taking it any longer! [reaches into his jacket pocket] You all pushed me to this! [pulls out a pink bow and plops it on to his hat, then continues out the door. Butters just looks on. Cartman leaves the boys room and enters the girls room. Wendy and Bebe are at the mirror. Wendy is quick to notice, and then faces him. Cartman heads for a stall and Wendy block him]"
535,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,What the hell do you think you're doing?
536,18,3,Eric Cartman,I'm going to the potty.
537,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,This is the girls bathroom!
538,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger."
539,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,WHAT?!
540,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Did you notice the bow? [points to it] I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit. [barges into Stall 1, locks it, drops his pants, and sits down. Wendy shrugs with her palms up. The first poop falls and Wendy and Bebe recoil] Aaahhh!"
541,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,GET OUT OF HERE!
542,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy! [drops another deuce] Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. [groans to get another deuce out, followed by a fart. Red comes out of Stall 2]"
543,18,3,Red,What the hell is that?!
544,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,Cartman is using our bathroom!
545,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago."
546,18,3,Red,Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!
547,18,3,Eric Cartman,"It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. [farts and poops some more]"
548,18,3,Principal Victoria,I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
549,18,3,Eric Cartman,Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
550,18,3,Principal Victoria,"You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!"
551,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl."
552,18,3,Principal Victoria,"All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!"
553,18,3,Eric Cartman,That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
554,18,3,Principal Victoria,"Alright, listen Eric!"
555,18,3,Eric Cartman,Erica.
556,18,3,Principal Victoria,Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
557,18,3,Eric Cartman,"All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers."
558,18,3,Principal Victoria,With the what?!
559,18,3,Mr Garrison,"Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis."
560,18,3,Mr Mackey,But then cisgender-ed is just normal
561,18,3,Mr Garrison,"[faces Mackey and Victoria] Saying ""normal"" is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group. [gets emphatic] Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girls room!"
562,18,3,Principal Victoria,But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.
563,18,3,Mr Garrison,Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
564,18,3,Principal Victoria,Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
565,18,3,Mr Garrison,"Actually, [turns around and looks outside again] it's more like a royal flush."
566,18,3,Reporter,Gerald Broflovski?
567,18,3,Gerald Broflovski,Yes?
568,18,3,Brandon Carlile,"Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I was hoping you could help me... make sense of somethin'. I understand you had a very large party in your back yard last... last Sunday, was it?"
569,18,3,Gerald Broflovski,That's right. [Sheila appears in the background] My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
570,18,3,Brandon Carlile,"I also understand that a very famous pop artist, Lorde, was the entertainment at that party."
571,18,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited."
572,18,3,Brandon Carlile,"Well it, eh, it's just a little curious, you know? Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue?"
573,18,3,Gerald Broflovski,"...Sorry, I don't think I get your-"
574,18,3,Brandon Carlile,"You understand, we deal with a lot of fake stories at Spin. [glances at his pen] Was just wondering how the boys got someone like Lorde to play."
575,18,3,Gerald Broflovski,"From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something."
576,18,3,Brandon Carlile,You wouldn't know who?
577,18,3,Gerald Broflovski,No. Does it really matter?
578,18,3,Brandon Carlile,[slow zoom] Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady. It would be a shame if someone was... having fun at her expense.
579,18,3,Sharon Marsh,[walks up with the stockings] Randy? Whose are these?
580,18,3,Randy Marsh,[sits up] Aaah I don't know. Why?
581,18,3,Sharon Marsh,Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
582,18,3,Randy Marsh,In my jeans?
583,18,3,Sharon Marsh,Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
584,18,3,Randy Marsh,[gives in] ...Yeah. I do.
585,18,3,Red,[bangs on the wall on one side of stall 1] Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes!
586,18,3,Sia,Yeah! Recess is almost over!
587,18,3,Eric Cartman,"There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead."
588,18,3,Sia,Not while you're in here!
589,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls."
590,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,"Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-"
591,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what? [drops a deuce] That's what. [laughs his ass off. Principal Victoria walks in behind the girls] Suck my clit and balls."
592,18,3,Principal Victoria,"Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem."
593,18,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. [poops and farts]"
594,18,3,Principal Victoria,"If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! [Cartman farts one last time, cleans up, and leaves the stall]"
595,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?"
596,18,3,Principal Victoria,Would that be agreeable to you?
597,18,3,Eric Cartman,OH MY GOD!
598,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,That isn't fair!
599,18,3,Red,"Wendy, just go with it!"
600,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location."
601,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out."
602,18,3,Interior Designer for Cartman's personal restroom,"Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?"
603,18,3,Eric Cartman,Oh on that side?
604,18,3,Interior Designer for Cartman's personal restroom,"You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall."
605,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah."
606,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel."
607,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,"[in his chair at his desk, facing away from the camera] I know your wife means a lot to you, Randy, [turns around in his chair] but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us."
608,18,3,Randy Marsh,You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
609,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,"How many times have you said ""I think I've lost it"" and everything turned out to be okay?"
610,18,3,Randy Marsh,Every time?
611,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,"Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me."
612,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. [hangs up. He walks up to a poster and moves it to one side, revealing a hole in the wall with stacks of bills inside. He pulls out some more bills from his back pocket and adds them to the stacks]"
613,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,You wanted to see me?
614,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,"Sit down, Ron. [Ron sits] Whattaya know about one of our artists, Lorde?"
615,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,"[shrugs] Seventeen-year-old girl from New Zealand, great songwriter, [shrugs] humble."
616,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,Wrong. [turns to face him] She's a 45-year-old man in Colorado.
617,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,What?
618,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,"He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference."
619,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,Huh. [the realization sinks in] Holy shit.
620,18,3,Record Executive and Ron,"He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do."
621,18,3,Randy Marsh,Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
622,18,3,Sharon Marsh,[appears at the bedroom door] Randy?
623,18,3,Randy Marsh,"[drops the guitar and gathers up his sheets] I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. [chuckles]"
624,18,3,Sharon Marsh,I was. Can you help me unload the car? [turns left and walks away]
625,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah."
626,18,3,Sharon Marsh,[comes back and peeks inside] Randy?
627,18,3,Randy Marsh,"[loses his sheets] Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. [follows her to the car]"
628,18,3,Stan Marsh,What is that?
629,18,3,Butters Stotch,That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
630,18,3,Stan Marsh,Cartman's a girl now?
631,18,3,Butters Stotch,"He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. [turns around and walks away.]"
632,18,3,Eric Cartman,"[rushes up] It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go. [opens the door, looks inside and grins. Inside is one of the fanciest restrooms one will ever see. Icicle lights all around, waterfall to the left, fancy commode to the right, plush towels and toilet seat cover. Triumphant music plays] Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome. [closes and locks the door] Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good! [claps twice - he's got the Clapper feature in there. The lights dim and Vivaldi's Spring begins to play] Perfect. [reaches over for a cat-o-five-tails and begins whipping the toilet with it] Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide. [the kids nearby just stand there shocked] You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready! [remembers there are people outside] Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!"
633,18,3,Brandon Carlile,Peter Nelson?
634,18,3,Peter Nelson,Yes?
635,18,3,Brandon Carlile,"[pulls up a stool next to him] Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I understand you work at the U.S. Geological Survey?"
636,18,3,Peter Nelson,"Yeah, that's right."
637,18,3,Brandon Carlile,"I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde?"
638,18,3,Peter Nelson,"[sighs] Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?"
639,18,3,Brandon Carlile,Work with her? How? [they move to a booth for some privacy]
640,18,3,Peter Nelson,I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
641,18,3,Brandon Carlile,How's that?
642,18,3,Peter Nelson,"Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology."
643,18,3,Brandon Carlile,The what?
644,18,3,Peter Nelson,"She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch. [Brandon tries to figure out what to write, but draws a blank]"
645,18,3,Clyde Donovan,Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.
646,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Yup! You know what Hillary says: ""You can suck my clit and balls."" [goes into his bathroom]"
647,18,3,Red,"[talking to Bebe nearby] Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I-"
648,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey guys. [all look and stare. Wendy walks down the hallway dressed as her male persona, Wendyl, in t-shirt and vest, purple pants, hair pinned back.]"
649,18,3,Red,...Wendy?
650,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,How's it hanging'?
651,18,3,Craig Tucker,Whoa..
652,18,3,Jenny,Huh?
653,18,3,Jason White,"Whoa, wait, is that?"
654,18,3,Butters Stotch,Holy moly! [Wendy pulls out a key and goes into the Other bathroom]
655,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!"
656,18,3,Wendy Testaburger,It's cool. I'll wait.
657,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!"
658,18,3,Eric Cartman,"I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!"
659,18,3,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-"
660,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!"
661,18,3,Principal Victoria,"You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?"
662,18,3,Eric Cartman,Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!
663,18,3,Principal Victoria,I thought you were a chick.
664,18,3,Eric Cartman,"No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude! [thinks for a few seconds] That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!"
665,18,3,Eric Cartman,[runs up to Stan] Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
666,18,3,Stan Marsh,[surprised] What?
667,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?! [Stan looks around] Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! [walks away]"
668,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Shelly, that's enough time on your phone."
669,18,3,Shelly Marsh,"Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!"
670,18,3,Randy Marsh,You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
671,18,3,Shelly Marsh,[sits up] Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
672,18,3,Randy Marsh,[sees a poster of himself as Lorde] Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. [walks away saddened]
673,18,3,Stan Marsh,Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
674,18,3,Randy Marsh,Oh really? A-About... about what?
675,18,3,Stan Marsh,"Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside? [Randy sighs deeply and stands up to walk] I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?"
676,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde."
677,18,3,Stan Marsh,...What?
678,18,3,Randy Marsh,"It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down."
679,18,3,Stan Marsh,Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
680,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Yah, that's my cover."
681,18,3,Stan Marsh,"The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?"
682,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. [turns around and faces Stan] The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go ""Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games."" But they just- do what they want with my songs."
683,18,3,Stan Marsh,"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl."
684,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Autotune. Wanna see how I do it? [moments later, a music program pops up. Twelve tracks are shown at lower left] I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone. [plays the highlighted track] ""Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn"" [farts and poop noises] ""Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."""
685,18,3,Stan Marsh,"Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good."
686,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops. [replays the same track with drum loops added] Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything. [brings up the quantizer and chooses his settings] Backup instruments. [scale, beats, bass, tambourine, guitars, strings] And then finally I use the Autotune. [""Auto-Tuner v10."" He chooses his settings there, and the song is transformed. The same track is now enhanced with Sia's voice and no trace of Randy] ""Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."" [this is all too much for Stan to take in, and he passes out. Randy notices] Stan?"
687,18,3,Butters Stotch,"[walks past Stan, then stops] Hey! Everything okay, Stan?"
688,18,3,Stan Marsh,...I don't know where I belong...
689,18,3,Butters Stotch,"Just hold it. That's what I do now. [continues on his way. Stan walks towards the girls room, but veers left to look at the boys room. Then he spins round and walks to the Other room, whips out his key for it, and goes in.]"
690,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!"
691,18,3,Eric Cartman,Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
692,18,3,Principal Victoria,"Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?"
693,18,3,Stan Marsh,"I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused."
694,18,3,Eric Cartman,He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
695,18,3,Randy Marsh,"[in his Lorde attire.] You wanted to see me, boss?"
696,18,3,Randy's Boss,"Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde."
697,18,3,Randy Marsh,[closes the door and sits next to a woman] Hi Carol.
698,18,3,Carol,[avoiding eye contact] Lorde.
699,18,3,Randy's Boss,"Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off."
700,18,3,Randy Marsh,"Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined."
701,18,3,Randy's Boss,"Amazing, yeah. Uh... Lorde... for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to... uh... find your own space... to go to the bathroom. [a few seconds of silence] Everyone loves you, but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom. [whips out an executive key]"
702,18,3,Randy Marsh,"I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music."
703,18,3,Carol,"My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with [stops herself immediately]"
704,18,3,Randy Marsh,"With what? [moments of awkward glances follow] With what? [getting no answer, he gets up and leaves.]"
705,18,3,E! Anchor and Announcer,You are watching E! Entertainment News! That's how low you've sunk.
706,18,3,E! Anchor and Announcer,"It's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer Lorde. The singer went dark on Twitter claiming severe depression, and stating [the statement goes up on screen] ""I realize now that I make people uncomfortable. I need to give this up and go back to just being the old me."" Spin Magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week."
707,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!"
708,18,3,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!"
709,18,3,Eric Cartman,"At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?! [the other kids agree, but not strongly] What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!"
710,18,3,Butters Stotch,Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
711,18,3,Clyde Donovan,"[steps forward] Awe, come on, lay off him guys."
712,18,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!"
713,18,3,Clyde Donovan,"No, no, just he is. [retreats and walks away]"
714,18,3,Sharon Marsh,You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
715,18,3,Randy Marsh,"[Raises up his Pabst to show Sharon] It's okay, it's gluten free."
716,18,3,Sharon Marsh,"All right. [turns around and goes back towards the house, but stops and looks back] Do you know why young people like Lorde so much. [Randy sits up and looks over his shoulder] It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. [goes back inside the house and closes the sliding door]"
717,18,3,Lorde,"[Randy's finished song, ""Feelin' Good On A Wednesday / Push""]
Feelin' good on a Wednesday

The image of me that you see
Is distorted, twisted, broken, fractured 
Isolated, miles out to sea
I don't want a separate place.
I need to feel safe, not thrown away, away, away.

And I will push (push)
To tear down the walls (push, push)
Of this box you put me in (push, push)
Because you don't understand
(push ow hot, push ow ow hot) You push
To find a label that fits me.
I'm feelin' good on a Wednesday
With sparklin' thoughts
Help me unload the car, yah yah yah

And so I push
To close the door
Of the stall you've made for me,
To keep me away.
And now we push
Push to stand together
Because I am Lorde (yah yah yah)
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde
I am Lorde, yah yah yah
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde
Yah yah yah
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde

Yah yah yah

[While the song plays, the following montage flows: camera closes in on Randy's face, then on a toilet. Some of the lyrics, handwritten on yellow rule paper, scroll past. Stan looks at the restrooms again. More lyrics. The demos are playing for the record producer and Ron, and they like it. More lyrics. Two sisters listen to the song on an iPhone in the kitchen. Their mother Carol looks on from the doorway. She returns to the office the next day and stops the boss from putting up the transgender sign on a bathroom. They both listen to the song, and like it. Shelly is wearing her headphones joyfully dancing to the song. Randy looks in and smiles. Principal Victoria waves a pencil around as if she were conducting an arrangement for this song. Bebe is listening to it with Milly and Nelly in her bedroom. Butters is in his own room wearing a pink tutu and dancing away. More lyrics. Brandon Carlile is at his desk looking at his article. He moves to delete it, and it's gone. He shuts down his computer and leaves]"
718,18,3,Principal Victoria,"And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. [cheering erupts from the students]"
719,18,3,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. [pulls off his bow and throws it to the ground.]
720,18,3,Principal Victoria,Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
721,18,3,Butters Stotch,Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
722,18,3,Stan Marsh,To the bathroom?
723,18,3,Butters Stotch,"Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom! [points to the Cissies bathroom, which used to be the Other bathroom] Well go on, cissy! [Stan walks over to the cissies bathroom and goes in. Butters smiles and walks away. The cissies bathroom is just the Other bathroom with a new plaque on it. Stan claps twice and the lights go down. Vivaldi's ""Spring"" plays]"
724,18,3,Stan Marsh,"Wow, this is is pretty nice. [drops trousers and settles in, then begins singing]

Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah"
725,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"[with phone in hand] Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys."
726,18,4,Sheila Broflovski,Sure. You bet.
727,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,Are you guys parked over here?
728,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way."
729,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,A Handicar? What's that?
730,18,4,Linda Stotch,You don't use Handicar?
731,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up."
732,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,Wow...
733,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes. [sees Linda talking to the Blacks] Honey, our Handicar is here."
734,18,4,Timmy Burch,"Timmy! [Linda waves goodbye to the Blacks and she joins Stephen in the Handicar, driven by Timmy.]"
735,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad. [The Handicar is a wheelchair with a Lil Zipper attached. The Lil Zipper is equipped with a table setting for two, including a candle and flower in vase.]"
736,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,Lucky.
737,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmy. [pulls away]
738,18,4,Stephen Stotch,Download the app! It works great! [Gerald whips out his phone and goes looking for the app. He finds it and downloads it.]
739,18,4,Passenger,"Ahh, [pinches his nose] Excuse me, I think someone puked back here. [pinches his nose again]"
740,18,4,Russian,You don't like puke?
741,18,4,Passenger,"Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please?"
742,18,4,Russian,"No air conditioning. Too expensive. [the light turns red and the driver brakes hard, causing the passenger to hit his head on the back of the front seat.]"
743,18,4,Passenger,Agh!
744,18,4,Russian,Not enough people taking cab. Don't know what's wrong!
745,18,4,Timmy Burch,"Timmih! [both driver and passenger look to the right. Timmy drives by in his wheelchair towing a man in his Lil Zipper, which is equipped with a table, tablecloth, candle, and two chairs. The man is sipping wine.]"
746,18,4,Russian,What the fuck?
747,18,4,Mr Stevenson,"We've got a big sales event going on, folks. [sees two men across the street] Hey guys. Can I get you in a 2014 Hummer? Rocktober sales event, guys."
748,18,4,Older and Younger Man,No thanks.
749,18,4,Mr Stevenson,"[plays some air guitar] Only a few more guitar licks left in Rocktober, guys."
750,18,4,Older and Younger Man,We're good. Shut up! [Timmy pulls up]
751,18,4,Older and Younger Man,"Oh, here's our Handicar."
752,18,4,Timmy Burch,"Timmy. [he stops, and the men get in.]"
753,18,4,Mr Stevenson,The fuck?
754,18,4,Counselor Steve,"All right, kids, you know what time of year this is? [the handicapped kids cheer] That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?"
755,18,4,All,Yeeaahhh!
756,18,4,Counselor Steve,"So far, Jimmy has raised $16!"
757,18,4,All,Yeeaahhh!
758,18,4,Counselor Steve,"Francis has raised $29.32 [the kids cheer] And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!"
759,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmy! [the other kids cheer]
760,18,4,Counselor Steve,"All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time! [the kids cheer. Off to the side, in the open doorway, are Nathan and Mimsy.]"
761,18,4,Nathan,"[turns around. Mimsy does too.] I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp."
762,18,4,Mimsy,"D'awww, we don't like camp, boss?"
763,18,4,Nathan,"We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks."
764,18,4,Mimsy,"D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark. [laughs. Nathan jumps in the air and smacks Mimsy on the right cheek with his left hand]"
765,18,4,Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast."
766,18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?"
767,18,4,Nathan,Shh-shh. [the counselor reaches them]
768,18,4,Counselor Steve,"Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?"
769,18,4,Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr."
770,18,4,Counselor Steve,"All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. [leaves]"
771,18,4,Nathan,"Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past."
772,18,4,Mimsy,D'oh boy!
773,18,4,SP Cabbie,"[wears an SP Cab hat] We are united as brothers, because jast as Handicar has taken away jobs from honest, hard-working cab drivers, it's also taken food [slams his fist on the podium] from the mouths of the children of car salesmen!"
774,18,4,Mr Stevenson,Well I don't have any children.
775,18,4,Russian,Who does this handicapped boy think he is?! He's not even in union!
776,18,4,Arab,He's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient.
777,18,4,SP Cabbie,"Aaand, because he's handicapped, he can use special access points and parking spaces. That kid was born with an unfair advantage!"
778,18,4,Arab,Who is this rat?!
779,18,4,Nathan,"His name is Timmy Burch. [the adults turn to look at him] And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good."
780,18,4,"SP Taxi drivers: Russian, Arab, American",Who are you?!
781,18,4,Nathan,Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
782,18,4,Russian,Nobody takes jobs away from US! We need to speak to Mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business!
783,18,4,Arab,Or maybe we can have the police shut him down!
784,18,4,Mimsy,"Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace?"
785,18,4,Nathan,Just ignore my friend. He's mentally disabled.
786,18,4,Mimsy,"Aw yeah, don't mind me."
787,18,4,Nathan,"Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?"
788,18,4,Mr Stevenson,Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?
789,18,4,Nathan,"No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! [the drivers look at each other]"
790,18,4,SP Cabbie,"Hey wake up, you little scab!"
791,18,4,Timmy Burch,[waking up] Tutih Tuh-Timmih?
792,18,4,SP Cabbie,We got a message for ya! From the union. [holds up a bat. The three cab drivers begin beating Timmy with baseball bats]
793,18,4,Nathan,"Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome. [The curb has a line of cabs on it, and they come across the cabbies who visited Timmy the night before.] Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?"
794,18,4,SP Cabbie,"Yeah, we sure did!"
795,18,4,Russian,Let's just say he'll be laid up a while.
796,18,4,SP Cabbie,Yeah. We snuck in his room last night and we... broke his legs!
797,18,4,Nathan,"Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what??"
798,18,4,Timmy Burch,"Timmy! [drives by, seemingly unharmed]"
799,18,4,Randy Marsh,[taking a ride in the Handicar] I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.
800,18,4,Russian,But we broke his legs. Both of them.
801,18,4,Nathan,"Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!"
802,18,4,Nathan,"How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy?"
803,18,4,Mimsy,"D'uh I don't know, boss."
804,18,4,Nathan,These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
805,18,4,Mimsy,"D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr."
806,18,4,Nathan,"[smacks him again] Shut up, Mimsyyyy!"
807,18,4,Woman 1,"Right here is good. [gets off at her house] Thank you. I can just use the app to tip you, right?"
808,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmy!
809,18,4,Woman 1,"Ohohh, this is so handy! [goes to the front door] Thank you!"
810,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmy. [gets a new call from an unknown caller and answers it] Tiiimmih Timmih.
811,18,4,Nathan,"Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan."
812,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
813,18,4,Nathan,"Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle."
814,18,4,Timmy Burch,[sighs] Timmih.
815,18,4,Nathan,I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
816,18,4,Timmy Burch,"[thinking it over] Hmmm, Timmih."
817,18,4,Nathan,I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
818,18,4,Timmy Burch,[smiles] Timmy! [grins. He likes the idea]
819,18,4,Nathan,"That's great. Summer camp, here we come. [hangs up] Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!"
820,18,4,Mimsy,D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?
821,18,4,Nathan,"It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers."
822,18,4,Mimsy,"D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss?"
823,18,4,Nathan,"It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me."
824,18,4,Mimsy,D'ah oh boy!
825,18,4,Nathan,"[arrives] Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in. [she gets in without saying a word] So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?"
826,18,4,Woman 2,[a transvestite] Sure. Would you like to see mine?
827,18,4,Nathan,Uh oh!
828,18,4,Nathan,"Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy! [Mimsy approaches, but stays outside. The passenger exits the restroom and walks away. Nathan waddles out, hair and clothes disheveled] And I thought a shark was bad. [cartoon flourish at the end]"
829,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up."
830,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila."
831,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Stephen, what are you doing?"
832,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in. [Gerald and Sheila get in, and Stephen pulls away.] I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a grat way to make some money on the side. [other Handicar drivers begin to appear]"
833,18,4,HC Driver 1,Timmy!
834,18,4,Stephen Stotch,Timmy!
835,18,4,HC Driver 2,[a woman] Timmy!
836,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald."
837,18,4,Mimsy,"[standing at a street corner with Nathan] D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss."
838,18,4,HC Driver 3,"[getting too close to the curb] 'Scuse me, out of my way, please. I have a Handicap. [drives off]"
839,18,4,Nathan,I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
840,18,4,Mimsy,"D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. Ah ""I drove a Lincoln way before I got paid to drive one."" Drrrr. [Nathan smacks him again]"
841,18,4,Nathan,Shut up Mimsyyy!
842,18,4,Announcer,"[female] For the pat eight years Tesla has been the leading innovator in the world of automotive transport. And now the President and CEO of Tesla Motorcars, Elon Musk. [a robotic arm reaches out and grabs a platform behind one of the cars, and Elon Musk is on the platform. The arm sets him down at the foot of the stage as cameas flash away]"
843,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,"Today I am proud to annouce the Tesla D, the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created. Any questions?"
844,18,4,Reporter 1,"Yes, ahh, what about Handicar?"
845,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,What about it?!
846,18,4,Reporter 2,Well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars.
847,18,4,Reporter 3,How do you intend to compete with this boy genius in Colorado? [Elon Musk is not happy]
848,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,"I am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing! The future of transportation is the electric cars, not wheelchairs!"
849,18,4,Exec 1,"Don't worry, Elon. Handicar is just a small company."
850,18,4,Exec 2,"Oh sure, operating in a few small towns, but when they start absorbing the taxi markets, bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world, driving your kids to and from school, delivering both people and things?"
851,18,4,Exec 3,We can't compete with Handicar! It's just so damned handy!
852,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,"If there is a way to reduce Handicar's positive publicity, then we need to do it now! [walks to the table and plants his hands on it] And you! You say it's theoretically possible?"
853,18,4,Nathan,"Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?"
854,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,Who's the sheepherder?
855,18,4,Nathan,You are.
856,18,4,Exec 4,Who's the snake?
857,18,4,Nathan,Handicar. [a few seconds of silence follow]
858,18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah, it's an analogy."
859,18,4,Nathan,"[smacks Mimsy] Shut up Mimsyyy! [to Elom Musk] If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity. [the Tesla execs look around at each other]"
860,18,4,HC Driver 4,[going the other way on the street] Timmy!
861,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmy! [stops at an intersection. A Tesla car speeds up next to him. The passenger window comes down and Nathan looks at him]
862,18,4,Nathan,Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
863,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [holds his right thumb up]
864,18,4,Nathan,[looks ahead] That's great. I can't wait for camp this year. [looks at Timmy again] We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?
865,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,Good day to you!
866,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
867,18,4,Nathan,"Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours."
868,18,4,Mimsy,"[pops up] D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss?"
869,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,"Shut up, Mimsy! [Mimsy reclines in his seat]"
870,18,4,Nathan,"Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. [the passenger window goes up, and they peel awat. The resulting wake almost blows the tablecloth off and Timmy's passenger almost losing his iPad keeping the tablecloth in place, At Skeeter's Bar and Coctails, a drunk patron walks out and a Handicar driver arrives to pick him up. He gets in, and they go away]"
871,18,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hey everyone, you need to see this! [CNN Breaking News]"
872,18,4,CNN Anchor,"[with glasses] What started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis. As electronic cars challenge the oil industry, and transportation alternatives fight for dominance, the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the '70s. It appears that the world is once again on the brink [takes off his glasses] of Wacky Races."
873,18,4,Randy Marsh,Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
874,18,4,CNN Anchor,"The prime minister of Japan (Shinzo Abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. They also claim that if a race does take place, they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype Lexus into the conflict. The Canadians and Chinese are also saying they would be forced to race, and no one yet has heard from Dick Dastardly or Muttley. Unless a miracle happens, this Saturday morning the world will witness the fist Wacky Races in nearly 50 years."
875,18,4,Shoppers,Wacky Races oh God! Wacky Races oh my God! Oh my God Wacky Races oh my God!
876,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!"
877,18,4,Randy Marsh,I know! Are we watching at your house?!
878,18,4,Food 4 Little Manager,"That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!"
879,18,4,Shoppers,No! I didn't get any! That guy has two! [more clamoring]
880,18,4,Food 4 Little Manager,"There's none left, don't you understand?!"
881,18,4,Stephen Stotch,Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
882,18,4,HC Driver 5,"Don't do the race. You don't have to prove anything. [Timmy is shown, weary]"
883,18,4,HC Driver 6,"He HAS to do it, don't you see? He has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible. There are hundreds of people with handicaps now."
884,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmih...
885,18,4,HC Driver 7,"But isn't that the problem? I mean, let's face it, it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up. Anyone can have a Handicap now. I mean, even Matthew McConaughey is a Handicar driver now, for Chrit's sake!"
886,18,4,Matthew McConaughey,Hey. [rolls up] I was drivin' a Handicar... way before I got paid to drive one. I just like how it feels.
887,18,4,Stephen Stotch,"Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry. [loses control of the wheelchair] Hold on, sorry, went too far. [comes back around] This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money. [Timmy begins to think over this]"
888,18,4,Announcer,"And here they are, the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the Wacky Races, competing for the title of the future of transportation. Cars are apporoaching the starting line. First off is the Lyft car [a purple sedan with a huge pink mustache on the grill], a ride-sharing company out of San Francisco. next up is the ZipCar, a pay-by-the-hour concept based on Chinese bicycles. Maneuvering for position is the standard taxicab driven by an angry Russian. Right behind is the Hummer salesman in his 2014 Hummer No Class. And there's ingenious inventor Elon Musk in his new Tesla D. Oh, and here's the lovely Canadian actress Neve Campbell in the Canadian conept vehicle The Queef, powered completely on female natural gas. [she queefs to make it go faster] Next we have the Handicar with Timmy Burch. And there's the completely automated self-driving car from Japan. Limping along last are those double-dealing do-badders Dick Dasterdly and his sidekick Muttley. [Muttley snickers] And away they go on the way out Wacky Races. [a shot of the adults gathered in the Broflovski living room, with milk and Franken Berry and Kap'n Krunch cereals on the coffee table] And this live coverage of the event will be broadcast all morning, of course, on CNN."
889,18,4,Stuart McCormick,Jesus. It's begun.
890,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,God help them all.
891,18,4,Randy Marsh,"All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today."
892,18,4,BBC Announcer,You are watching BBC World.
893,18,4,BBC Anchor,"The vioent conflict over transport is underway, and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember. We return you now to our live coverage of.. the Wacky Races."
894,18,4,Annoucer,"As the Wacky Raccers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear."
895,18,4,Timmy Burch,[way in back] Timmih!
896,18,4,Announcer,"[a map shows up] All the cars must follow the same route. First they'll leave the town of South Park, then navigate through Giggling Gulch on the final stretch to pick up the passenger, a Miss Dotty Applegate. Once the passenger is picked up, the vehicle must successfully deliver her to the destination point at her daughter's house in Morrison. [back to the race] It looks like the ZipCar is trying to vie for position past the Hummer vehicle. It's neck and neck as the Wacky Racers all push to be first to pick up the passenger. [An elderly lady waits for her ride at a Thrift Or Less store] Miss Applegate is waiting patiently. [the racers are shown] And Elon Musk's Tesla appears to take the lead."
897,18,4,Nathan,Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
898,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,But I though we wanted Handicar to lose the race!
899,18,4,Nathan,"He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. [he shows off a control pad]"
900,18,4,Mimsy,"D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel? [Nathan and Elon just look at him] You know, tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react. [they keep loooking at him, and he gets a clue] Wait wait, I got it. [smacks himself] Shut up, Mimsy!"
901,18,4,Nathan,Hey Mimsy.
902,18,4,Mimsy,[leans forward] Yeah?
903,18,4,Nathan,[smacks him] Shut up! [Mimsy sits back]
904,18,4,Announcer,"The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey."
905,18,4,Matthew McConaughey,[nice mood music in the car] I was drivin' a ZipCar... way before I got paid to drive one.
906,18,4,Announcer,"And look at this! The Lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger. [Ms Applegate gets into the back seat, and the Lyft driver takes off] Now the Lyft car must take the passenger to her destination, but look at this! The Hummer salesman is running the Lyft car off the road! And the Hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself!"
907,18,4,Mr Stevenson,[pitching the Hummer to her] You've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here. What do you think? Huh? Can you see yourself in one of these puppies?
908,18,4,Announcer,Elon Musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the Hummer out of commission for good. [a cannon rises out of the Tesla and fires a shot at the Hummer. The missile hits the Hummer and blows it up.]
909,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,Wow.
910,18,4,Randy Marsh,Geez!
911,18,4,Stuart McCormick,God.
912,18,4,Randy Marsh,Did you see that?! Oh!
913,18,4,Announcer,"The passenger is being taken to the Tesla D now. [Mr. Stevenson is dead, the Hummer is totaled. Musk escorts Miss Applegate, but the South Park taxi driver scoops her up] No way! She just got snatched by the pissed off Russian in his taxi. Miss Applegate is now in the back of the taxi and she's being forced to watch Jimmy Fallon. [Fallon is rubbing a giant pickle in his guest's face. Meanwhile, The Queef has stupped running] Uh oh, the Canadian car has completely run out of queefs. [Heve tries three times, but there are no more queefs in her] With the race neearly over, it's taxi out in front followed by self-driving car, and then pulling up in third is Handicar!"
914,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
915,18,4,Announcer,It's gonna be a close one!
916,18,4,Dick Dastardly and Muttley,"Not too close, Boopsie! [Muttley snickers]"
917,18,4,Announcer,"Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again."
918,18,4,Randy Marsh,"Ohh! Ohh! Duuude! [Dick Dastardly saws a tree in two, and the tree falls on the taxi, destroying it and the self-driving car that runs into the taxi. The adults in the Broflovski living room react to this]"
919,18,4,Gerald Broflovski,Oh no! Ohh!
920,18,4,Sharon Marsh,"Oh no, I can't watch! [shields her face.]"
921,18,4,Randy Marsh,Oooo! Booom!
922,18,4,Mrs McCormick,Ohohohh!
923,18,4,Stuart McCormick,Nice! Oh yeah! [Sheila just hides her eyes]
924,18,4,Announcer,And there's Handicar to pick Miss Applegate up. [she climbs in and the Tesla is pulling up fast]
925,18,4,Nathan,That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet! [sees a bunch of cars closing in on him on his phone] Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars? [lowers his window] Holy shit! [sees a fleet of Handicar drivers coming at the Tesla]
926,18,4,HC drivers,Timmy! Timmy! [the drivers just bunch up on the Tesla and push it over on its side]
927,18,4,Elon Musk and four of his executives,Aaaaaah!
928,18,4,HC drivers,Timmy!
929,18,4,Announcer,"We're near the finish line; the race is almost over. Handicar is in the lead, still way out in front of the ZipCar driven by Matthew McConaughey. [a shot of Matthew listening to his mood music]"
930,18,4,Matthew McConaughey,Sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward. Are we drivin' cars or are cars... drivin' us?
931,18,4,Announcer,"Dastardly car is racing past both. [Nathan and Mimsy hijacked it. Mimsy is driving] This could be an upset, folks. [Mimsy makes a U-turn and parks the Dastardly car off the road. He and Nathan get out]"
932,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
933,18,4,Nathan,"Goodnight, you son of a bitch! [the ZipCar reaches them and Nathan presses the detonator on his control pad. The ZipCar blows up. Mimsy and Nathan take notice] Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!"
934,18,4,Mimsy,D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!
935,18,4,Nathan,"Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! [secondary explosions create a portal above Matthew McConaughey, and he's sucked in]"
936,18,4,Announcer,"Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside."
937,18,4,Matthew McConaughey,"Mimsy! [the car levitates a bit, but as soon as the wormhole is gone, it falls back on the road]"
938,18,4,Announcer,And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it!
939,18,4,Timmy Burch,Timmih! [the handicapped kids all cheer]
940,18,4,Counselor Steve,"A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp. [the kids cheer] Great job to all of you. This is sure to be the best summer camp ever! [more cheering]"
941,18,4,Nathan s Mom,"All set for bed, honey?"
942,18,4,Nathan,Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime.
943,18,4,Nathan s Mom,"All right, goodnight. [kisses him on the temple and heads for the door]"
944,18,4,Nathan,"Wait! [she stops] Wait, Mom? Can we talk?"
945,18,4,Nathan s Mom,"Um... yes, o-of course. [sits down on his bed]"
946,18,4,Nathan,"This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore."
947,18,4,Nathan s Mom,"I'm sorry, I can't understand you honey. You're handicapped."
948,18,4,Nathan,What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
949,18,4,Nathan s Mom,You want water? Is that what you want?
950,18,4,Nathan,No! I don't wanna go to camp!
951,18,4,Nathan s Mom,"Ohhh yes, okay honey, I'll turn off the lamp. [gets up, turns it off, and walks out, closing the door behind her]"
952,18,4,Nathan,"No! That's not what I fucking said! [stumbles around in his room] Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!"
953,18,4,Nathan s Dad,What's he saying?
954,18,4,Nathan s Mom,"That he doesn't wanna go to summer camp this year, but I'll be damned if he's gonna ruin our Italy trip."
955,18,4,Nathan s Dad,Right.
956,18,4,Nathan,[still stumbling in his room] Oh! Aah! Mimsy!
957,18,5,Butters Stotch,"Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo."
958,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[opens Butters' door and enters] Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?"
959,18,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took."
960,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[heads for Butters' bed] Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl! [gets on Butters' bed and lays down on his back.] I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!"
961,18,5,Butters Stotch,"I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato."
962,18,5,Eric Cartman,No it isn't.
963,18,5,Butters Stotch,My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
964,18,5,Eric Cartman,That's stupid.
965,18,5,Butters Stotch,You can see the momma bird fly in.
966,18,5,Eric Cartman,I'm dying of boredom.
967,18,5,Butters Stotch,We took all kinds of video with his drone.
968,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[sits up, suddenly interested] What did you say?"
969,18,5,Butters Stotch,"[looks over his shoulder] You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff."
970,18,5,Eric Cartman,Your dad has a fucking drone?
971,18,5,Eric Cartman,Whooaa! [runs up to it for a closer look]
972,18,5,Butters Stotch,It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
973,18,5,Eric Cartman,[pulls his finger back and smiles at Butters] You wanna take it out for a spin?
974,18,5,Butters Stotch,Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
975,18,5,Eric Cartman,[runs up to Butters and stands next to him] Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
976,18,5,Butters Stotch,My dad said it's not for spying on people.
977,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know."
978,18,5,Butters Stotch,Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
979,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, good idea. [picks up the drone] We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!"
980,18,5,Butters Stotch,"[goes to take the drone back] No, Eric. I don't wanna d-"
981,18,5,Stephen Stotch,[off screen] Butters?
982,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go! [leaves the garage with the drone as Butters faces the source of the call, then pulls down the garage door] I'll see you later at my house."
983,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, are you home??"
984,18,5,Butters Stotch,Comin' dad! [leaves the garage through the side door into the house]
985,18,5,,"[Cartman's house, night. He's been working with the drone, figuring out how to operate it. There's a knock on his door.]"
986,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Butters, is that you?"
987,18,5,Butters Stotch,"Yes, it's me."
988,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[opens the door just a crack and peeks out] Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!"
989,18,5,Butters Stotch,Of course not!
990,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Alright, come in. [opens the door to reveal Kenny] Kenny's here; I told him all about it. [Kenny waves hello]"
991,18,5,Butters Stotch,What?! You said nobody would know!
992,18,5,Eric Cartman,"It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out. [outside, the drone sits in the grass in the backyard, 50 feet away from the house. Suddenly it rises to 23 feet, above the boys' heads, then veers to the right] Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! [the drone's camera shows some backyards through a fish-eye lens. A dog barks up at it from below.]"
993,18,5,Butters Stotch,Be careful! The powerlines!
994,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards! [in the distance, Kenny's house is shown from the back two blocks away. The drone veers to the right and drops down a bit, headed for a back door] Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!"
995,18,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Okay, try to get closer!)"
996,18,5,Butters Stotch,"Okay, uh maybe that's enough. [the drone approaches Craig's window]"
997,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh. [Craig is shown at his computer. The drone moves to the next window and shows Craig's mom undressing.] Craig's mom is taking off her clothes."
998,18,5,Kenny McCormick,(Are you serious?!)
999,18,5,Butters Stotch,[gruffly] Let me see!
1000,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!"
1001,18,5,Kenny McCormick,(Stop taping!)
1002,18,5,Butters Stotch,Jeeeeezz!
1003,18,5,Eric Cartman,"This thing is recording, right?"
1004,18,5,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
1005,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that? [Craig's mom has heard the drone and called her husband Thomas over. She stands behind him as they both look at the drone outside their window] Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! [thrusts the controller at Butters]"
1006,18,5,Butters Stotch,What do I do?!
1007,18,5,Eric Cartman,His dad sees you!
1008,18,5,Butters Stotch,[begins to panic] I don't know what to do!
1009,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Fly back to the house, stupid!"
1010,18,5,,"[The Stotch house, night. Thomas Tucker bangs on the front door and Stephen comes to answer it.]"
1011,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"You've got a problem, Stotch!"
1012,18,5,Stephen Stotch,What are you talkin' about?
1013,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!"
1014,18,5,Stephen Stotch,Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.
1015,18,5,Thomas Tucker,Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
1016,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you."
1017,18,5,,"[The Stotch house, garage. Stephen leads Thomas to the garage. He opens the side door]"
1018,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"There, you see? It's right there. [sure enough, the drone and its controller are on the garage floor as expected.]"
1019,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"So, thuh so you flew it back here in time."
1020,18,5,Stephen Stotch,I swear I didn't fly it.
1021,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! [hurries out of the garage. Stephen looks at the drone and wonders... spooky theremin music plays, so he's a little afraid as well]"
1022,18,5,,"[Butters' room, night. Stephen opens Butters' door and looks in]"
1023,18,5,Stephen Stotch,Butters?
1024,18,5,Butters Stotch,"[already in his PJs and in bed, but clearly panting] Oh, heh-hey dad."
1025,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?"
1026,18,5,Butters Stotch,"[panting throughout] Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?"
1027,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you."
1028,18,5,Butters Stotch,"I love you too, Dad. [Stephen leaves and closes the door. That was close.]"
1029,18,5,,"[South Park, morning. At the bus stop, Cartman and Kenny wait for the school bus]"
1030,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!"
1031,18,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I know, dude.)"
1032,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Not a word, Kenny!"
1033,18,5,Kenny McCormick,(Alright!) [Stan and Kyle's voices are heard]
1034,18,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?"
1035,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore."
1036,18,5,Stan Marsh,I know. [they take their places next to Cartman]
1037,18,5,Eric Cartman,Hey you guys.
1038,18,5,Stan Marsh,"Sup? [the pressure gets to Cartman, but he resists. He finally cracks]"
1039,18,5,Eric Cartman,You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
1040,18,5,Kenny McCormick,(Dude! What the fuck!)
1041,18,5,Stan Marsh,What?
1042,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? [whips out his phone]"
1043,18,5,Kenny McCormick,(Dude!)
1044,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,"That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it."
1045,18,5,Eric Cartman,You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
1046,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
1047,18,5,Stan Marsh,Let me see.
1048,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[shows Stan] Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro."
1049,18,5,Stan Marsh,How'd you get that on your phone?
1050,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Um, uh... Kenny? [motions for Kenny to get closer, but Kenny doesn't budge] Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?"
1051,18,5,Kenny McCormick,[grudgingly] (Uh huh.)
1052,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,That's terrible!
1053,18,5,Eric Cartman,"I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it."
1054,18,5,,"[South Park Elementary, later. Craig is at his locker when Jimmy, Token and Clyde approach him]"
1055,18,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? [he and the other two chuckle]"
1056,18,5,Craig Tucker,What are you talking about? [Cartman comes into view at the end of the hall and walks towards the boys room]
1057,18,5,Jimmy Valmer,Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. [he and the other two chuckle. Cartman chuckles as well]
1058,18,5,Craig Tucker,For what?
1059,18,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. [he and the other two chuckle. Butters comes out of nowhere and shoves Cartman into the boys room, slamming him into the stall 1 wall]"
1060,18,5,Butters Stotch,What the heck are you doing?!
1061,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, Butters, chillax bro."
1062,18,5,Butters Stotch,When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
1063,18,5,Eric Cartman,Butters-
1064,18,5,Butters Stotch,You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
1065,18,5,Eric Cartman,Butters. Butters.
1066,18,5,Butters Stotch,Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
1067,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I had to! [Butters lets him go] Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!"
1068,18,5,Butters Stotch,WHY?!
1069,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!"
1070,18,5,Butters Stotch,I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
1071,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! [they leave the restroom. Stall 1 opens and Kyle steps out, angry at what he just heard]"
1072,18,5,Roger Donovan,"Hi everyone. For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and un, just like you I'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood."
1073,18,5,Thomas Tucker,How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
1074,18,5,Roger Donovan,"Yes, well luckily nobody's watched the video of course. [a round of denials from the gathered adults] But the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular. I mean, anyone can get a drone off Amazon for 200 bucks, and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy. Oh-ohh, God I'm sorry Laura. [she looks around and gets mad] You know I I meant the situation is pretty hairy, right? Nothin' to do with you p-personally. I mean, how would I even know? I didn't see it. [she crosses her arms] Um..."
1075,18,5,Randy Marsh,"[stands up] Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush. [winces. Sharon puts her face in her left hand] Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. [sits down and looks at Sharon]"
1076,18,5,Laura Tucker,"You know, it used to be called ""natural"". Completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing."
1077,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"It's okay honey, the-"
1078,18,5,Laura Tucker,"But now, because I ""choose"" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be,"
1079,18,5,Randy Marsh,Eeww.
1080,18,5,Laura Tucker,I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster!
1081,18,5,Roger Donovan,"And and and that's the point. I mean, we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing, that that-"
1082,18,5,Laura Tucker,I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural!
1083,18,5,Stuart McCormick,It's a lot of natural.
1084,18,5,Roger Donovan,"Look, look, why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us, a neighborhood watch, to make sure that our community stays safe."
1085,18,5,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?"
1086,18,5,Randy Marsh,It's simple.
1087,18,5,,"[The neighborhood, day. The first Neighborhood Watch drone, which is black, appears, followed by more drones.]"
1088,18,5,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. [smiles]"
1089,18,5,,[The bus stop. The four boys are there. A Neighborhood Watch drone flies over it and then flies off.]
1090,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,Are you happy now?!
1091,18,5,Eric Cartman,What? [the drone returns and goes the other way]
1092,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?"
1093,18,5,Eric Cartman,What does that have to do with me?
1094,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,"See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!"
1095,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude."
1096,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman! [another drone floats by in the background] I know what-"
1097,18,5,Eric Cartman,You were what?!
1098,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,I was in the bathroom-
1099,18,5,Eric Cartman,You were spying on me?!
1100,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!"
1101,18,5,Eric Cartman,"But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!"
1102,18,5,Kyle Broflovski,How is that spying?!
1103,18,5,Eric Cartman,"You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! [another drone hovers by]"
1104,18,5,Hobby Enthusiast Clerk,"Hello, can I help you?"
1105,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, I'd like to return this drone. [sets it on the counter. The clerk looks through the open box]"
1106,18,5,Hobby Enthusiast Clerk,You wanna return it?
1107,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore."
1108,18,5,Hobby Enthusiast Clerk,The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? [Butters puts his arms tight against his sides and glances here and there]
1109,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it... [leans in] flies by itself."
1110,18,5,Hobby Enthusiast Clerk,"Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it."
1111,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"[stands straight] You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked. [leans in] The battery was half empty."
1112,18,5,Hobby Enthusiast Clerk,"[looks at Butters, then back at Stephen] I'm sorry, but we don't do returns. [Butters relaxes a bit]"
1113,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about."
1114,18,5,Hobby Enthusiast Clerk,"Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. [Butters tenses up again]"
1115,18,5,Stephen Stotch,You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.
1116,18,5,Hobby Enthusiast Clerk,"Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?"
1117,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision. [looks down to his right, then to his left. The clerk fixes his gaze on him]"
1118,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"Oh for God's sakes! [goes into the bathroom, where he sees Laura at the sink, having just gotten out of the shower. He also sees another drone outside the window, which has open curtains] Goddamnit get the hell out of here! [the drone hurries away, and he goes to the window and closes the curtains] That DOES IT!"
1119,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!"
1120,18,5,Officer 1,"But they aren't illegal, Mr. Tucker."
1121,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!"
1122,18,5,Sgt Yates,"Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day."
1123,18,5,Officer 1,"We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-"
1124,18,5,Laura Tucker,"I haven't been ""humiliated"", I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?!"
1125,18,5,Officer 1,Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.
1126,18,5,Officer 2,Or perhaps a forest ranger?
1127,18,5,Thomas Tucker,Help us with the drones spying on us!!
1128,18,5,Sgt Yates,"All right, all right. We'll do everything we can."
1129,18,5,,"[South Park Elementary, day. Cartman walks by the boys restroom when Butters comes at him again and shoves him into the restroom, again slamming him into the stall 1 wall.]"
1130,18,5,Butters Stotch,Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
1131,18,5,Eric Cartman,Butters.
1132,18,5,Butters Stotch,"Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!"
1133,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Because, Butters-"
1134,18,5,Butters Stotch,Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
1135,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[brushes Butters' hands off his jacket] Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay- [stops and kneels down to see if there's anyone in the stall, then gets up again] Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video."
1136,18,5,Butters Stotch,Why?!
1137,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."""
1138,18,5,Butters Stotch,That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
1139,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!"
1140,18,5,Randy Marsh,"Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta."
1141,18,5,Sharon Marsh,You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
1142,18,5,Randy Marsh,"I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing. [the drone leaves the Broflovski house and hovers over to the Neloson house, where Nelson is having sex with his girl. Randy puts his wine glass on the bedstand and concentrates on the video feed. He glances at Sharon a few times to see if she's noticing. She isn't. Soon, a police drone appears, with blue and red flashing lights and a siren. It aims for Randy's drone.] Oh shit! [gets his drone to fly off, but the police drone keeps up] Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch! [has the drone turn to face the police drone, which is armed. The police drone fires two rounds into Randy's drone, which falters. Sharon finally looks over] I've been shot! [his drone crashes into a backyard] No! Noooo!"
1143,18,5,News 4 Anchor,"Shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an on-duty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone, and worst of all, yes, the civilian drone was black. [a picture of a similar drone pops up behind him]"
1144,18,5,Jimbo Kern,What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
1145,18,5,Randy Marsh,I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
1146,18,5,Farmer,"It was about yay big. [strokes the back of his head] I mean the hair on it was out to here [spreads his arms out so there's three feet between his hands], and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button. I mean, the, the drone. Yeah, that's what I saw. That that's all I saw."
1147,18,5,News 4 Anchor,"While police claim they were only following standard protocol, the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil."
1148,18,5,,"[Downtown South Park, night. A group of civilian drones hovers down the street, each drone holding a lit candle. Sirens and lights come up and the drones turn right to see police drones approaching]"
1149,18,5,Police drone,"Please disperse. Candles on top of drones are a fire hazard, [the civilian drones look at each other] Return to your garages."
1150,18,5,Mr Garrison,[on his bed holding the controller and a glass of wine] What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?
1151,18,5,Steve Black,"[on his bed with Linda, his wife] Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering."
1152,18,5,Stephen Stotch,[looking frazzled] Randy. We need to talk.
1153,18,5,Randy Marsh,Okay.
1154,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Inside. [Randy lets him in and moments later sits on the sofa with Sharon and Butters. Stephen paces the floor before them] I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news. [walks up to Randy] Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?"
1155,18,5,Randy Marsh,No. I didn't. [theremin music starts up as Stephen walks back to where he was]
1156,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them."
1157,18,5,Randy Marsh,What might be?
1158,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??"
1159,18,5,Randy Marsh,...Drones are spooky?
1160,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby."
1161,18,5,,[News 4 news break.]
1162,18,5,News 4 Anchor,"The town of South Park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police. After police used excessive force at a peaceful protest, the town has now broken out into full-scale riots. [sure enough, there are riots all over the place, but no humans are rioting. It's all the drones. One drone crashes into a building, then bounces off it and into a car through the windshield. Another drown crashes through Tele's display window and two others make off with a flatscreen TV] As the people of South Park continue to protest, the South Park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew. The governor has asked for help from the National Guard to bring order to the town."
1163,18,5,20/20 Announcer and Reporter,"Tonight on an all-new 20/20. [a Viper probe droid appears onscreen...] A town in crisis over the matter of privacy. [...and gets a red ""NO"" circle stamped on it] Now for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush."
1164,18,5,,[The Tucker house. A 20/20 reporter is interviewing Thomas and Laura in low light]
1165,18,5,20/20 Announcer and Reporter,You've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues.
1166,18,5,Laura Tucker,"I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop?"
1167,18,5,20/20 Announcer and Reporter,It just... keeps going on and on. Kind of like your... [Laura gets mad] I mean... it just... goes outside what most people would call... acceptable.
1168,18,5,Laura Tucker,Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird!
1169,18,5,Thomas Tucker,"It's okay, honey."
1170,18,5,20/20 Announcer and Reporter,"I didn't see the video. I don't believe in doing that, but uh... I'm just saying that... the situation in in your town is... unwieldy? [the power begins to flicker and on monitors everywhere the image of Stephen appears, with Butters behind him. Stephen now has facial hair and a paranoid look about him]"
1171,18,5,Stephen Stotch,Please do not adjust your televisions!
1172,18,5,20/20 Announcer and Reporter,What is that?
1173,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby. [a shot of Gerald and Sheila in bed with their glasses of wine and their controllers] All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page, [holds up a printout of the YouTube page] it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did? [a shot of Gerald and Sheila, then Steve and Linda] We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!"
1174,18,5,Eric Cartman,Oh hey Butters. Sup?
1175,18,5,Butters Stotch,Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
1176,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what's the matter?"
1177,18,5,Butters Stotch,I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
1178,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. [takes Butters in and closes the door]"
1179,18,5,Butters Stotch,"I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!"
1180,18,5,Eric Cartman,Butters.
1181,18,5,Butters Stotch,I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
1182,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[while Butters speaks] Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters."
1183,18,5,Butters Stotch,I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
1184,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones."
1185,18,5,Butters Stotch,You do?
1186,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing."
1187,18,5,Butters Stotch,What?
1188,18,5,Eric Cartman,Your dad's drone.
1189,18,5,Butters Stotch,NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
1190,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!"
1191,18,5,Butters Stotch,...Okay.
1192,18,5,,"[Butters' house, night. Stephen is at the sofa preparing a sizeable bomb. He's soldering the ends of a cable together, then takes a sip of spirits, then picks up a grenade launcher and pops a grenade in place. He stands up]"
1193,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"Time to end this hobby once and for all! [he moves stealthily to his garage, opens the door, and jumps in ready to blow his drone up, but finds it missing again] No! NOOOO!"
1194,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[with the controller] Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff."
1195,18,5,Butters Stotch,"If this doesn't work, we're dead."
1196,18,5,Eric Cartman,"It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. [he gets the drone going. It rises, pulling behind it a blow-up doll made to resemble Laura, with a large bushy wig over the crotch. The drone and doll hover away from Cartman's house.]"
1197,18,5,,"[A convention room, night, several days later. Stephen Stotch is at the podium with the rest of the town seated at tables. Everyone is applauding the Tuckers, but Laura isn't pleased.]"
1198,18,5,Stephen Stotch,"We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said ""No more!"" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. [more applause, and Laura buries her face in her right hand. A minstrel with lute comes out to sing Laura's praises]"
1199,18,5,Minstrel,"Have you heard the tale of Craig's mom's bush
And the night that it saved us from drones?
Nobody knew the power it had.
They just thought it was shaggy and gross.
Craig's mom live a life of shame and despair
Everyone feared her great giant bush!"
1200,18,5,Laura Tucker,They didn't!
1201,18,5,Minstrel,"But then when drones were filling the sky,
She unfurled her bush and she used it to fly.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Gargantuan thicket of madness.
Bigger than earth and denser than gold.
Truly a magical bush to behold."
1202,18,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, you see Butters, everything worked out. [Butters doesn't respond] ""Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."""
1203,18,5,Butters Stotch,Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
1204,18,5,Eric Cartman,"[taken aback, then sighs] Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy."
1205,18,5,Butters Stotch,No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
1206,18,5,Eric Cartman,You're welcome. [the minstrel begins to sing again]
1207,18,5,Minstrel,"And she flew and she flew away into the sun
And then she died.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Truly a magical bush to behold."
1208,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks over his shoulder] Kyle, hang on a sec. [He's holding his phone, on which is a Terrance & Phillip game]"
1209,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns to face him] Hey, Jimmy. What's up?"
1210,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun."
1211,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. Really?
1212,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?"
1213,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[considers it for a moment] Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out."
1214,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"You betcha, pal. [grins. Kyle turns and walks away and the grin fades. Jimmy turns and continues on his way]"
1215,18,6,Announcer,"The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game. [The game goes from the splash screen to a layout of their town, starting at their house. Coins float over the streets, ready to be grabbed. The announcer pops into view] In this game, you are Terrance & Phillip. Can you collect all the Canadian coins? *poot* [disappears.]"
1216,18,6,Announcer,"That's one coin. Can you collect more? [Kyle taps on more coins on the screen] You've collected ten Canadian coins! [a big red 10 appears on a yellow star] Congratulations! [that word, also in red, appears above the 10] Hey, you're really good at this, guy!"
1217,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1218,18,6,Butters Stotch,"Congratulations, Kyle."
1219,18,6,Announcer,"[pops up again] With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada. [only five buildings, all houses, are shown, with the rest of the area being undeveloped] Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk! [a Royal Bank price chart appears, with purchases going from 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents to 5700 for $50] How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?"
1220,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,This is stupid!
1221,18,6,Butters Stotch,"Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. [Kyle taps on the button and coins pop out at him]"
1222,18,6,Announcer,You buy 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents! You're amazing! Now use that Canadough to help rebuild Canada! Click to build a hospital here. [a floating red arrow pops up on the empty block across from Terrance & Phillip's house. Kyle taps on it and the hospital appears]
1223,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Yaaay!
1224,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
1225,18,6,Eric Cartman,[approaching wit Kenny] What are you two boners doing?
1226,18,6,Butters Stotch,We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
1227,18,6,Eric Cartman,I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
1228,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Who makes this crap?
1229,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!"
1230,18,6,Prince,Where is the roof on this thing?
1231,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,[the double doors burst open and Terrance & Phillip storm their way in] What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
1232,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?"
1233,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
1234,18,6,Prince,"Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming."
1235,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.
1236,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,It's the dumbest game ever! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
1237,18,6,Prince,"Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!"
1238,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!"
1239,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),[low voice] They see through the charade.
1240,18,6,Prince,"Uh oh, you think so?"
1241,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"I think they see through the charade, yes."
1242,18,6,Prince,"I'm pretty sure they can hear us too. [Yes, and they're not pleased one bit.]"
1243,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up! [walks up to a large heavy rope and pulls on it. A bell sounds and the curtain around the room go up, revealing white boards that show how the mobile game is set up. Terrance & Phillip are suddenly bewildered] Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years, gaming was simple: you pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps, we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you pay for incentives, you're rewarded!"
1244,18,6,Prince,"Free""mium"". The ""mium"" is Latin for ""not really."""
1245,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"It's a simple cycle, a never-ending loop based on RPGs: Explore -> Collect -> Spend -> Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money."
1246,18,6,Prince,It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun!
1247,18,6,Randy Marsh,"You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! [whips out a phone bill. Sharon's arms are crossed]"
1248,18,6,Stan Marsh,I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much.
1249,18,6,Randy Marsh,"You didn't realize! What are ""Canadian coins""?"
1250,18,6,Stan Marsh,You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
1251,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!"
1252,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I'll pay you back for it, okay?!"
1253,18,6,Randy Marsh,How?!
1254,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ!"
1255,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter! [Sharon lies down] I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa."
1256,18,6,Sharon Marsh,Wull whattaya mean?
1257,18,6,Randy Marsh,[faces Sharon] Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
1258,18,6,Sharon Marsh,Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
1259,18,6,Randy Marsh,"I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.[dramatic exit music]"
1260,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles: entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-"
1261,18,6,Prince,So they'll forget they're spending money.
1262,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),-and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.
1263,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?"
1264,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun. [the Prince gives Terrance and Phillip each a check.]"
1265,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,What's this?
1266,18,6,Prince,Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.
1267,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,So this is- Everyone is doing this?
1268,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),Ehhhveryone is doing it.
1269,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,It's just the way things are going?
1270,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),It's the way things are going!
1271,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad."
1272,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"[in the game] Hey Phillip! [Stan's bedroom door opens and in walk Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman]"
1273,18,6,Stan Marsh,Ohhh hey guys.
1274,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You... missed school today?
1275,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best."
1276,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
1277,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?"
1278,18,6,Eric Cartman,"How much money did you micropay today, Stan?"
1279,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. [smiles]"
1280,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
1281,18,6,Stan Marsh,"You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?"
1282,18,6,Eric Cartman,Yes.
1283,18,6,Stan Marsh,"It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out."
1284,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?"
1285,18,6,Eric Cartman,Jimmy told me about this game.
1286,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, who told you about this game?"
1287,18,6,Kenny McCormick,(Jimmy.)
1288,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what?!"
1289,18,6,Eric Cartman,The?!
1290,18,6,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck?!)
1291,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here. [a boy crosses the street and stands next to him] Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?"
1292,18,6,Boy,What do you mean?
1293,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,The Terrance & Phillip mobile game. [whips it out] All the cool kids are usin' it.
1294,18,6,Boy,"Aw, I don't know."
1295,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff. [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny appear at the other end of the block and spot him, then walk towards him a few seconds later] It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? [the boys reach him]"
1296,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?"
1297,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Why sure fellas. [the boy turns left and walks away] Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid."
1298,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to him] Dude, what are you doing?!"
1299,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
1300,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You need to stop recommending that app to people!
1301,18,6,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
1302,18,6,Eric Cartman,Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
1303,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all."
1304,18,6,Eric Cartman,It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
1305,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[crosses his arms] Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!"
1306,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"[on the spot] Alright, alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff."
1307,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You just push it on other people?!
1308,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,They pay me to!
1309,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!"
1310,18,6,Prince,"You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game."
1311,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing."
1312,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),Oh. Ah what is the matter?
1313,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. [Terrance jumps up and farts on Phillip, who laughs.]"
1314,18,6,Prince,"But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan."
1315,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
1316,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that! [gasps] Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in ""moderation""?"
1317,18,6,Prince,Ohhhhh. [claps furiously]
1318,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Do you really think that would help?
1319,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!
1320,18,6,Announcer,"You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK! [screen goes black with ""Drink Responsibly"" in white on it] Please drink responsibly."
1321,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go. [Stan catches up] That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine. [they approach Marvin] Come on Dad, we're going home."
1322,18,6,Marvin Marsh,"[playing at a 25 cent Lucky Unicorn slot machine] Ah, go away."
1323,18,6,Randy Marsh,Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
1324,18,6,Marvin Marsh,What are you talkin' about?
1325,18,6,Randy Marsh,I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
1326,18,6,Stan Marsh,It's just...
1327,18,6,Marvin Marsh,It's fun.
1328,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's fun."
1329,18,6,Randy Marsh,It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
1330,18,6,Marvin Marsh,Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
1331,18,6,Randy Marsh,"I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six! [walks up to a small buffet cabinet on which sit six different glasses of wine, from syrah to rosé] It's called a tasting, and it's classy![Marvin looks away]"
1332,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it."
1333,18,6,Marvin Marsh,"[faces forward] Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop."
1334,18,6,Randy Marsh,"All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore. [gulps down the glass of Merlot] HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*"
1335,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman. [turns around and walks across the room] People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
1336,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
1337,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
1338,18,6,Eric Cartman,[approaches Jimmy and grabs him by the shirt collar] And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
1339,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"I needed the money, alright?! [Cartman releases him and he walks off a bit] I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!"
1340,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You have your crutches!
1341,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much."
1342,18,6,Eric Cartman,That makes sense.
1343,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,You're saying these games do this on purpose?!
1344,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,[faces the boys] Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
1345,18,6,Voice Notification,"Hey, buddy. Come on, guy. [Stan turns to his left side and the notification disappears, but just as he closes his eyes another one follows.] Come back, friend. You've got new buddies, guy. [Stan takes his pillow and puts it over his head. The third notification comes in] We've just given you 5000 Canadian coins. [Stan quickly looks at his phone] Enjoy your Canadough."
1346,18,6,Stan Marsh,"...Free? [puts his pillow back on the mattress, grabs the phone and starts playing again]"
1347,18,6,Randy Marsh,"What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!"
1348,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up."
1349,18,6,Randy Marsh,"$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!"
1350,18,6,Stan Marsh,One?
1351,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!"
1352,18,6,Stan Marsh,"No, no, it's not."
1353,18,6,Randy Marsh,"You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!"
1354,18,6,Stan Marsh,I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
1355,18,6,Randy Marsh,"I am not chugging beer! [walks up to the breakfast table on which are eight glasses of wine and eight of beer, paired up. He's gone through four pairs already] I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! [plops the fifth lager into the fifth wine glass and chugs down the pair, then blows a whistle while shaking his head with his hands. Stan has nothing to say.]"
1356,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, I need help. [sometime later Cartman, Kenny and Jimmy arrive, and Stan picks up where he left off. The conversation moves to the living room, and Kyle gives Stan a comforting tap on the right shoulder] There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand."
1357,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?"
1358,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Sure. Come on, guys. [he, Cartman and Kyle walk away]"
1359,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic."
1360,18,6,Stan Marsh,It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
1361,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help."
1362,18,6,Stan Marsh,How?
1363,18,6,Jimmy Valmer,"What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say ""I have a problem."" And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. [Stan is left deep in thought]"
1364,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[brainstorming] We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-"
1365,18,6,Eric Cartman,It's done. [he had been texting on his phone]
1366,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Wuh, what's done?"
1367,18,6,Eric Cartman,"The word is out. [shows him the phone] ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it. [glances at his phone's screen] It's trending."
1368,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
1369,18,6,Prince,You what?
1370,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game."
1371,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
1372,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!"
1373,18,6,Prince,"Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?"
1374,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games really work. [pulls down on the heavy rope again and new, prepared whiteboards come down over the used ones. The doors close and the room gets dim.] The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents."
1375,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,But then all our profits come from people with problems.
1376,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke."
1377,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"[snorts the bump] Okay, but we still won't stand for this!"
1378,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? [a bright, fiery light appears behind him and he turns to look at it. Satan emerges from it]"
1379,18,6,Satan,You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!
1380,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them."
1381,18,6,Satan,"Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul! [moments later he's on Stan's bed, the fiery light gone] So you got dopamine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce."
1382,18,6,Stan Marsh,Okay.
1383,18,6,Satan,"But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff."
1384,18,6,Stan Marsh,So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
1385,18,6,Satan,"Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopamine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life."
1386,18,6,Stan Marsh,So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
1387,18,6,Satan,"Yeah, that's pretty much what it means."
1388,18,6,Stan Marsh,The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
1389,18,6,Satan,"Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?"
1390,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, no, this is great."
1391,18,6,Satan,"Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec."
1392,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers."
1393,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,"Oh God, he just doesn't stop!"
1394,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Who IS this guy?!
1395,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're COUNTING on it!! It's the same with us, but we've got our eyes on every addict's screen! [the whiteboards begin to dissolve into the walls, with the words floating around independently]Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!"
1396,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
1397,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil. [he transforms into a Canadian devil and floats up towards the ceiling] I'm the Canadian Devil. [laughs]"
1398,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!
1399,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Beelzeboot!
1400,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"You discovered my plan, but too late! [lets out a flaming turd] Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me!"
1401,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Oh no!
1402,18,6,Prince,"Oh, what have I done?!"
1403,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),Heheheh! Hahaha! [lets out a flaming turd]
1404,18,6,Satan,"So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopamine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff.[puts the whiteboard aside] Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ?"
1405,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?"
1406,18,6,Satan,"You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too, so people have free will and all that shit. But ,you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay."
1407,18,6,Voice Notification,"*Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?"
1408,18,6,Satan,What's this?
1409,18,6,Stan Marsh,"That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. [Satan taps the screen, stands up, and plays the game]"
1410,18,6,Satan,"What, you just collect coins?"
1411,18,6,Announcer,How much money can you buy today?
1412,18,6,Satan,"No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?"
1413,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Ah, Canada?"
1414,18,6,Satan,"Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, ""temptation has to be nuanced!"" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?"
1415,18,6,Stan Marsh,...Okay. [Satan proceeds to possess Stan] Aaaaahhh!
1416,18,6,Randy Marsh,Oh pass interference! Interference! [points at the TV. Stan walks by]
1417,18,6,Sharon Marsh,"Stan, where are you going? [Randy looks over]"
1418,18,6,Stan Marsh,[with Satan's voice] I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. [continues out the door]
1419,18,6,Randy Marsh,Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. [Sharon looks at him]
1420,18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil."
1421,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"[flies up to the microphone] Hey, guy, I'm the Canadian Devil. [lets out a flaming turd and flies back into the Department]"
1422,18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world. [Beelzeboot goes to torture Terrance, Phillip, and the Prince, who now hang from chains tied to the ceiling]"
1423,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Heh heheheh, I stab you. [Satan, now in Stan's body, appears outside the meeting room and blows the doors off, then walks in]"
1424,18,6,Satan,Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!
1425,18,6,Terrance & Phillip,Who the fuck is that?
1426,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan! [lets out a flaming turd]"
1427,18,6,Satan,"Return from whence you came! [purple balls of energy appear around his hands, and they produce two beams of flame which carry Beelzeboot out into the sky]"
1428,18,6,Minister of Mobile Gaming / Beelzeboot (Canadian Satan),"Ow! Watch it, guy! [the battle continues in the sky]"
1429,18,6,NC 9 Reporter,"Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton. [The Canadian Minister of Sports appears on split screen]"
1430,18,6,Minister of Sports,"Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years."
1431,18,6,Canadian,"Screw that, go Canada!"
1432,18,6,Satan,"Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come. [the balls of energy reappear and this time he aims the flames down at Beelzeboot. He destroys the Department in the meantime. Flaming skulls appear and go back into the pit Satan created]"
1433,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hey dude.
1434,18,6,Stan Marsh,Hey.
1435,18,6,Kyle Broflovski,Y-you alright?
1436,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. [turns away and walks off the court]"
1437,18,6,Eric Cartman,Cool.
1438,18,6,Prince,"My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, shitty tundra. [cheers erupt from the crowd]"
1439,18,6,Stan Marsh,"I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie."
1440,18,6,Marvin Marsh,"Well okay, good idea. [Stan rolls the dice]"
1441,18,6,Randy Marsh,[stops by with an ornate silver cup] What are you gaywads doin'?
1442,18,6,Stan Marsh,"We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps."
1443,18,6,Randy Marsh,"Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. [takes a seat]"
1444,18,6,Stan Marsh,"That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking."
1445,18,6,Randy Marsh,"It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse."
1446,18,6,Stan Marsh,"Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. [Marvin takes the dice and rolls them]"
1447,18,6,Randy Marsh,You guys wanna put some money on it? [Stan bangs his head on the table.]
1448,18,7,Butters Stotch,"WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there! [Craig turns to watch] I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa... [He and Stan bump into each other and Butters begins to run his hands over him] Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it."
1449,18,7,Stan Marsh,"[holding Butters off] Butters, what the hell are you doing?"
1450,18,7,Butters Stotch,I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
1451,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[hidden around the corner, in front of the camera] That's awesome, Butters. [snickers away from the walkie-talkie] Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? [snickers away from the walkie-talkie]"
1452,18,7,Butters Stotch,"More of the school. [Clyde talks to Bebe, who seen leaves]"
1453,18,7,Clyde Donovan,"What are you doing, Butters?"
1454,18,7,Butters Stotch,The school and all the kids. [Clyde walks away] I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
1455,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I- [mutes the walkie-talkie and whispers] He's so fucking stupid. [un-mutes it] But I'm sure they will soon."
1456,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[beginning to wobble] Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- [about to take off the fake headset,]"
1457,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[watching him from around the corner] Butters, no! Are you crazy?!"
1458,18,7,Butters Stotch,What what what?
1459,18,7,Eric Cartman,What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
1460,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[turns so that he's facing away from the camera] Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!"
1461,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!"
1462,18,7,Butters Stotch,I'm sorry!
1463,18,7,Eric Cartman,You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
1464,18,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
1465,18,7,Eric Cartman,You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
1466,18,7,Butters Stotch,[begins to run] Oh Jesus! [Cartman looks on from around the corner]
1467,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Okay, I'm back in your room!"
1468,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright Butters, sit down at the computer. [Butters does this] Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!"
1469,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[drops a shield over the glasses] Suppornity window dropped. [Cartman enters his room, locks the door and turns on the lights, then walks over to Butters and removes the fake headset. Butters wipes his eyes]"
1470,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Welcome back, dude."
1471,18,7,Butters Stotch,Wow! That was cool!
1472,18,7,Eric Cartman,How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
1473,18,7,Butters Stotch,I touched Wendy's boobs. [guess he feels okay.]
1474,18,7,Eric Cartman,"And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back."" [pounds his left fist on the table] Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!"
1475,18,7,Stan Marsh,Sound pretty typical to me.
1476,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!"
1477,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Coup de grah, Cartman"
1478,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle."
1479,18,7,Stan Marsh,Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
1480,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!"
1481,18,7,Butters Stotch,Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period? [in a knowing voice] Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? [chuckles]
1482,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again."
1483,18,7,Butters Stotch,"You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said ""Well, technically I was in school."" Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?"
1484,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Right Butters. [softly over his left shoulder] These guys are so dumb, huh?"
1485,18,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah. [runs off with his food tray]
1486,18,7,Eric Cartman,See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
1487,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?"
1488,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Well, not a hundred percent..."
1489,18,7,Eric Cartman,Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. [hands him the headset and Butters puts it on.]
1490,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Okay, subject is ready."
1491,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[picks up the walkie-talkie] Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now. [presses a few keys on the keyboard] Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?"
1492,18,7,Butters Stotch,Interim status is go.
1493,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[turns off the room light so the fluorescent lights stand out] Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, [raises the shield]Mark. [quickly hides in the closet as Butters gets accustomed to the headset again]"
1494,18,7,Butters Stotch,It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
1495,18,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside."
1496,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Going now! [bumps into the door frame, then goes downstairs. A second or two later Cartman comes out of the closet, turns on the light, goes to his computer and sits on his chair]"
1497,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work."
1498,18,7,Butters Stotch,Okay.
1499,18,7,Butters Stotch,How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
1500,18,7,Eric Cartman,You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
1501,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Okay. It's so realistic. [a shot of Stan watching from across the street.] The snow looks kind of fake though. [Stan leaves the window] Alright, I think that's all of it."
1502,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money."
1503,18,7,Butters Stotch,[rings the doorbell. A middle-aged woman answers the door with a dollar bill in her hand] There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
1504,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Just take the money, Butters! [Butters reaches for the bill and takes it.]"
1505,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Okay, I got it!"
1506,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You got the money? [Butters walks down the walkway as the lady closes the front door] Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point."
1507,18,7,Butters Stotch,Already? Oh no!
1508,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back. [eats some more chips] Are you heading back Butters? [no reply.] Butters? [Butters goes home] Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid."
1509,18,7,Butters Stotch,"I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. [goes inside, leaving the front door open]"
1510,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!"
1511,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!"
1512,18,7,Stephen Stotch,I know that! What do you-?
1513,18,7,Butters Stotch,This is for all the times I got grounded! [Make a fist and fires it at Stephen's groin. Stephen doubles over in pain]
1514,18,7,Stephen Stotch,Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
1515,18,7,Butters Stotch,"HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist! [at the other end of the call, Cartman is shocked] Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!"
1516,18,7,Linda Stotch,"Butters, why?? Oh my God!"
1517,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Huh, that was incredible!"
1518,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[getting worried] Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now."
1519,18,7,Butters Stotch,"I feel amazing! [giggles] I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?! [starts throwing rocks] Eh take that, you stupid cars! [a hit car screeches to a halt]"
1520,18,7,Driver,"[steps out of the car] What the hell are you doing, Kid?!"
1521,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place."
1522,18,7,Butters Stotch,[knocks the driver out of the car] Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
1523,18,7,Driver,Hey! [Butters peels away]
1524,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now"
1525,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh shit! [runs outside] Butters! Butters, where are you now?"
1526,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here."
1527,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?"
1528,18,7,Butters Stotch,I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
1529,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Wait, hang on Butters!"
1530,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Take that, you dumb hooker!"
1531,18,7,Hooker,What you doin' motherfucker?!
1532,18,7,Butters Stotch,I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
1533,18,7,Eric Cartman,Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
1534,18,7,Butters Stotch,"I can't [wheeze] I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!"
1535,18,7,Eric Cartman,Butters?? Butters?? [turns the walkie-talkie off]
1536,18,7,Dr Carroll,"You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch."
1537,18,7,Butters Stotch,I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
1538,18,7,Dr Carroll,"No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine."
1539,18,7,Butters Stotch,Aw nuts!
1540,18,7,Dr Carroll,"Try and relax, and when your parents get here we'll sort this all out. [the doctor and nurse leave. The nurse turns off the light]"
1541,18,7,Butters Stotch,I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
1542,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters. [Butters looks to his right. Dramatic camera pan from Butters to Cartman, who stands on the window sill like Morpheus]"
1543,18,7,Butters Stotch,Ahhh!
1544,18,7,Eric Cartman,Are you okay?
1545,18,7,Butters Stotch,Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
1546,18,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm not here, Butters."
1547,18,7,Butters Stotch,What?
1548,18,7,Eric Cartman,"This is going to be hard to understand, Butters, [climbs down to the floor] but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this... [spreads his arms out] is real."
1549,18,7,Butters Stotch,[looks around skeptically] Nuh uh!
1550,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. [pulls off the missing thumb trick.]"
1551,18,7,Butters Stotch,WHAT?? [Cartman puts on a couple of thumb lights and clicks them on and off in alternate order.]
1552,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. [pulls out a wand from his sleeve and produces a bouquet of flowers from it]"
1553,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[now on edge] Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!"
1554,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you."
1555,18,7,Butters Stotch,Ah how do you know that?!
1556,18,7,Eric Cartman,[pressing a buzzer] How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? [hides under the bed]
1557,18,7,Nurse,Everything okay in here?
1558,18,7,Butters Stotch,Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
1559,18,7,Nurse,O-kay. [turns around and walks out. Cartman comes out from the window side of the bed]
1560,18,7,Eric Cartman,Butters.
1561,18,7,Butters Stotch,NO!
1562,18,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! [performs another trick in which he gets a coin inside a glass bottle... and succeeds]"
1563,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[thoroughly scared, shuts his eyes] AAAAAAHAHAH! [he opens them moments later and Cartman is gone.]"
1564,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!"
1565,18,7,Eric Cartman,I'm happy that I totally got away with it. [gets a call] What's a 911 area code? Hello?
1566,18,7,Steve,"Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help."
1567,18,7,Eric Cartman,With what?
1568,18,7,Steve,"This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend."
1569,18,7,Eric Cartman,[slowly] Fuck you!
1570,18,7,Steve,"I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten."
1571,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You should probably listen to him, dude."
1572,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality."
1573,18,7,Steve,"The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend."
1574,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Guys, tell him you're not computer programs."
1575,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[glances at Stan and Kenny] Maybe we are.
1576,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[sighs and squeezes his eyes shut for a moment] Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now."
1577,18,7,Steve,"I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time."
1578,18,7,Eric Cartman,Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! [Well...]
1579,18,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric? Poopsiekins? [hearing no reply, she opens his door and goes in] Eric? [Steve was right. Cartman is at his computer wearing the Oculus headset, in a coma-like trance] Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now. [Cartman's left foot twitches] I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat? [this time Cartman moves his whole body] All right, I'll just leave it here, hon. [sets the burger next to the computer] I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.[exits and closes the door]"
1580,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!"
1581,18,7,Butters Stotch,Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
1582,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED! [Butters recoils and Stephen slams the door shut. Butters turns around and goes to sit on the floor beside his bed. The door opens and Cartman enters]"
1583,18,7,Eric Cartman,Are you fucking with me?!
1584,18,7,Butters Stotch,...What? What do you mean?
1585,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!"
1586,18,7,Butters Stotch,I don't know what you mean.
1587,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Because if you are, it's not cool!"
1588,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!"
1589,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!"
1590,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh really? Oh, that's a relief."
1591,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!"
1592,18,7,Butters Stotch,Oh gosh!
1593,18,7,Eric Cartman,That's right!
1594,18,7,Butters Stotch,OH GOSH!
1595,18,7,Eric Cartman,"THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?"
1596,18,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
1597,18,7,Eric Cartman,Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! [Butters is alarmed]
1598,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[answers] Hello?
1599,18,7,Butters Stotch,"Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!"
1600,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Again?
1601,18,7,Butters Stotch,"No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!"
1602,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Uh huh.
1603,18,7,Butters Stotch,"I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!"
1604,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now."
1605,18,7,Butters Stotch,PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
1606,18,7,Stephen Stotch,Butters?! Who is that?!
1607,18,7,Butters Stotch,Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- [Kyle looks concerned and hangs up]
1608,18,7,Kenny McCormick,"[runs up to Stan and Kyle, panicked] (You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!)"
1609,18,7,Kenny McCormick,(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
1610,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
1611,18,7,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
1612,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[slowly] Fuck you!
1613,18,7,Kenny McCormick,[taken aback] (What??)
1614,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Get up, Cartman!"
1615,18,7,Kenny McCormick,"[angry] (This isn't a prank, Kyle!)"
1616,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso! [shakes Cartman's chair] You're goin' to the hospital!"
1617,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, maybe this is for real."
1618,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks back at Stan, then turns around to face him] Fuck you if you're in on this."
1619,18,7,Stan Marsh,"In on what? [thinks a moment...] Ohh, [slowly] Fuck you!"
1620,18,7,Steve,"Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares. [listens to the response] That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service. [clicks to the next caller] El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve."
1621,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service."
1622,18,7,Steve,"Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend. [clicks again] Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve."
1623,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset."
1624,18,7,Steve,"Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?"
1625,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Kyle.
1626,18,7,Steve,Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
1627,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't care!
1628,18,7,Steve,"He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems."
1629,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
1630,18,7,Steve,Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
1631,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[rolls his eyes, then slowly] Fuck you!"
1632,18,7,Stan Marsh,"""Fuck you"" what?"
1633,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,He said they're doing a Total Recall.
1634,18,7,Stan Marsh,Oh fuck you!
1635,18,7,Steve,"All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?"
1636,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,You haven't done anything yet!
1637,18,7,Steve,But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
1638,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
1639,18,7,Steve,"Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? [Kyle looks at his phone, then at the user's manual]"
1640,18,7,Eric Cartman,"It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. [the doorbell rings and he answers. It's Kyle.]"
1641,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you."
1642,18,7,Eric Cartman,I know. Let's go to the backyard. [turns and walks to the backyard. Kyle is quite surprised by Cartman's reaction. Moments later they takes seats at the picnic table out back. A butterfly floats by]
1643,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible."
1644,18,7,Eric Cartman,Okay Kyle.
1645,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here."
1646,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?"
1647,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here."
1648,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[laces his fingers together, with his index fingers making a steeple in front of his lips] Mmmhmm."
1649,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me."
1650,18,7,Eric Cartman,"And why did the guys send you, Kyle?"
1651,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Www-what do you mean?
1652,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on."
1653,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Fuck you!
1654,18,7,Eric Cartman,"I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle."
1655,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Don't... do that!
1656,18,7,Eric Cartman,Calm down.
1657,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-"
1658,18,7,Eric Cartman,"In virtual reality, yes you did."
1659,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,No. Then I came into this virtual space.
1660,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!"
1661,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
1662,18,7,Eric Cartman,[defeated] Fuck!
1663,18,7,Best Buy Rep,Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?
1664,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
1665,18,7,Eric Cartman,Or if I did?
1666,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?"
1667,18,7,Best Buy Rep,"Sir, I'm gonna have to connect you to Customer Service. Hang on a sec. [transfers the call and hangs up. The call now reaches ... Steve!]"
1668,18,7,Steve,"Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve."
1669,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[stunned at the familiar voice] Dude... What?
1670,18,7,Eric Cartman,What? [takes the phone from Kyle] Hello?
1671,18,7,Steve,"Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future."
1672,18,7,Eric Cartman,Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
1673,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"[loudly] Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?"
1674,18,7,Linda Stotch,"Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings."
1675,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded. [hears something upstairs] And no bouncing the racquetball either!"
1676,18,7,Stan Marsh,"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! [the door opens and Cartman and Kyle walk in]"
1677,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait. Stan? [walks up to Stan] Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?"
1678,18,7,Stan Marsh,"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real."
1679,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-"
1680,18,7,Stan Marsh,"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time."
1681,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
1682,18,7,Eric Cartman,"[still lost] No, you guys. This is virtual reality."
1683,18,7,Stan Marsh,How do you know?
1684,18,7,Eric Cartman,Because... I'm a computer program.
1685,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,God damn it Cartman!
1686,18,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real."
1687,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,He's lying.
1688,18,7,Eric Cartman,I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
1689,18,7,Stan Marsh,What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
1690,18,7,Steve,Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
1691,18,7,Stan Marsh,Butters called Customer Service first?
1692,18,7,Steve,Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
1693,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we're going to Butters' house! [they leave Kenny behind]"
1694,18,7,Steve,"Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service."
1695,18,7,Steve,"Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve."
1696,18,7,Steve,"Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service."
1697,18,7,Steve,"Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service."
1698,18,7,Steve,"Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real."
1699,18,7,Steve,"...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono."
1700,18,7,Steve,"My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop."
1701,18,7,Steve,"[slowly, wagging his left index finger] Ohhh, fuck you!"
1702,18,7,Steve,"Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?"
1703,18,7,Steve,What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
1704,18,7,Steve,"Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!"
1705,18,7,Steve,But you didn't answer any of my questions!
1706,18,7,Steve,"Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?"
1707,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[singing a spiritual] I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. [his door opens and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come in]"
1708,18,7,Stan Marsh,Butters.
1709,18,7,Butters Stotch,[startled] Huh. But... [stands up] you guys can't be here.
1710,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Why not?
1711,18,7,Butters Stotch,Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
1712,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
1713,18,7,Butters Stotch,"When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember? [goes to the bedroom door] We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life."
1714,18,7,Stan Marsh,So now we are in th real world.
1715,18,7,Butters Stotch,YES.
1716,18,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys! [the boys look at him] I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!"
1717,18,7,Stephen Stotch,[appears behind him] Butters!
1718,18,7,Butters Stotch,[really startled] AAaaghagh!
1719,18,7,Stephen Stotch,What are your friends doing here?!
1720,18,7,Butters Stotch,Huh I'm sorry Dad!
1721,18,7,Steve,"Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?"
1722,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Yes, we're here."
1723,18,7,Steve,"Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems."
1724,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!"
1725,18,7,Stan Marsh,"[as Stephen chews Butters out, puts some distance between them and himself] Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?"
1726,18,7,Steve,That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
1727,18,7,Stan Marsh,"What?! [Stephen unbuckles his belt, Butters holds a hand up]"
1728,18,7,Steve,Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
1729,18,7,Stan Marsh,"That doesn't make sense! [Stephen takes his belt off. Butters closes his eyes, knowing what's coming]"
1730,18,7,Steve,"That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! [the boys look at Stephen and Butters as Stephen prepares his belt for a whipping]"
1731,18,7,Stephen Stotch,Well you're getting it now!
1732,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!! [Stephen disappears, then Butters, then Kyle, then Cartman] You guys? Are you there?"
1733,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,[from a walkie-talkie] We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
1734,18,7,Stan Marsh,Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. [leaves Butters' room. Stephen and Linda never really left the dining room table/ Stephen senses a change in mood]
1735,18,7,Stephen Stotch,Oh my gosh! Linda!
1736,18,7,Linda Stotch,"What is it, Stephen?"
1737,18,7,Stephen Stotch,It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.
1738,18,7,Linda Stotch,He's not?
1739,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"No. I've I've got to tell him! [leaves his chair and runs up to Butters' room] Butter? Butters! [Butters is on his bed, with the curtains open, asleep]"
1740,18,7,Butters Stotch,"[wakes up] Ahhh, huh?"
1741,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"You can go outside and play, son."
1742,18,7,Butters Stotch,"You... you, you mean ih... [sits up] I'm not grounded?"
1743,18,7,Stephen Stotch,"No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over."
1744,18,7,Butters Stotch,They did it! [hops off his bed] They figured it out! [heads out the door] Whoopie!
1745,18,7,Stan Marsh,"Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?"
1746,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
1747,18,7,Stan Marsh,"[goes upstairs and enters Cartman's room] Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room."
1748,18,7,Eric Cartman,"Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. [Stan does this]"
1749,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, dude, take off the headset. [Stan reaches up and removes the headset. At this point the animation switches to live-action. Stan finishes taking off the headset as Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny watch]"
1750,18,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?"
1751,18,7,Stan Marsh,"[thoughtfully looking at the headset] It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck."
1752,18,8,Girl 1,[handing out fliers] Hey guys. [Clyde takes one] Thanks. Support your team? Thank you. Hey guys. Did you get one of these? [walks up to Cartman and Craig] Hope you can make it.
1753,18,8,Eric Cartman,[takes a flier] What's this?
1754,18,8,Girl 1,The girls' volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
1755,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[looks at Craig.] Girls volleyball? [they both laugh at the thought] Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy."
1756,18,8,Girl 2,What's wrong with supporting girls' athletics?!
1757,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay? [hands the flier back to girl 1] All right."
1758,18,8,Girl 3,"[walks up to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is ""We're too busy."""
1759,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
1760,18,8,Girl 3,What fight?
1761,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls' volleyball. [he, Kenny, and Kyle laugh]"
1762,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch."
1763,18,8,Magic Player/ Slaughterhouse,"Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my Elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on."
1764,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,Can Kenny block his Elderbeast?
1765,18,8,Stan Marsh,Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
1766,18,8,Eric Cartman,This asshole needs to make a move already!
1767,18,8,Referee,"Quiet in the peanut gallery, please."
1768,18,8,Magic Player/ Slaughterhouse,"I am attacking, but with a newly summoned Spark Ghast who has Trample. Four damage to your planeswalker."
1769,18,8,Boys,Ohhhh!
1770,18,8,Butters Stotch,Oh no! Kenny!
1771,18,8,Stan Marsh,Shhh!
1772,18,8,Butters Stotch,But he's dying! [Kenny lays down a card]
1773,18,8,Stan Marsh,What's that?
1774,18,8,Eric Cartman,He's playing an enchantment.
1775,18,8,Stan Marsh,This late?
1776,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
1777,18,8,Magic Player/ Slaughterhouse,I can block that with Uprooted Minotaur. [Kenny lays down his next card]
1778,18,8,Boys,Ohhhh!
1779,18,8,Referee,Serendib Sorcerer unblocked. Winner: McCormick!
1780,18,8,Boys,Yeeahhh!
1781,18,8,Magic Player/ Slaughterhouse,Nnoohhh!
1782,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, it was complete brutality!"
1783,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,You've never seen anything so ruthless!
1784,18,8,Stan Marsh,It was seriously almost hard to watch. [Wendy appears in the distance and walks over to the boys]
1785,18,8,Eric Cartman,"At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!"
1786,18,8,Stan Marsh,"[sees Wendy] Wendy, did you hear about last night?"
1787,18,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, I heard the girls' volleyball team won by like 20 points."
1788,18,8,Stan Marsh,Not that. Did you actually go to that?
1789,18,8,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
1790,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Pfft, whatever."
1791,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this! [the janitor finally looks at the group] It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!"
1792,18,8,Janitor Mitchell,"Hey! Pssst! [the boys see him] Come over here. [the boys walk over to him while the other kids disperse] You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?"
1793,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro."
1794,18,8,Janitor Mitchell,"Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit."
1795,18,8,Stan Marsh,We're men.
1796,18,8,Janitor Mitchell,"Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here. [hands them a sheet of paper with an address on it, and Kyle steps forward to take it] This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet. [turns right and leaves] And you might wanna pack a barf bag."
1797,18,8,Eric Cartman,[steps forward and watches him leave] Kewwwl!
1798,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok."
1799,18,8,Eric Cartman,What's hardcore and exciting about Chity shrimp? [they approach the doors]
1800,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,It doesn't even look like they're open. [tugs and knocks at the doors]
1801,18,8,Mr Tuong,[unlocks the doors and answers them] We crosed! We crosed for the night! Go away prease! [waves them away]
1802,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?"
1803,18,8,Mr Lu Kim,You purice?
1804,18,8,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
1805,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, do we look like police?"
1806,18,8,Mr Lu Kim,"Okay, come on, come on, five dorrah, five dorrah each! Come on, five dorrah!"
1807,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Five dorrah?! [Mr. Lu Kim hushes them quickly and leads them to the back room, which leads to the basement. Lu Kim opens the basement door]"
1808,18,8,Mr Lu Kim,"You go down! Go down, find seat! We in sixth fight! Gogogogogogogo! [the kids go in, then Mr. Tuong, who closes the door behind him.]"
1809,18,8,Announcer,Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card. Fluffy counters with a mana card of his own. And he plays a Fugitive Wizard!
1810,18,8,Crowd,Ooooooo.
1811,18,8,Announcer,"More mana from Scrambles! And yes, that is Crippling Blight! Crippling Blight to the Fugitive Wizard! Creature now has -1 to strength and defense! More Mana from Fluffy. Now he'll attack with Fugitive Wizard, and there's an instant attack from Scrambles! That is Peel from Reality! Fugitive Wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!"
1812,18,8,The boys,Whoa!
1813,18,8,Announcer,The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!
1814,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that was total carnage!"
1815,18,8,Stan Marsh,That was freakin' hardcore.
1816,18,8,Eric Cartman,Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
1817,18,8,Stan Marsh,It was just decimation.
1818,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
1819,18,8,Eric Cartman,"We're going again on Friday, right?"
1820,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Hell yeah! [Kenny lowers his head, and Cartman notices]"
1821,18,8,Eric Cartman,What's the matter Kenny?
1822,18,8,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
1823,18,8,Stan Marsh,What's mean about it?
1824,18,8,Kenny McCormick,[mumbles]
1825,18,8,Eric Cartman,You feel bad for the roosters?
1826,18,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)"
1827,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard."
1828,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally."
1829,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder."
1830,18,8,Kenny McCormick,(No.)
1831,18,8,Eric Cartman,Huh? A little bit?
1832,18,8,Kenny McCormick,(NO.)
1833,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster."
1834,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!"
1835,18,8,Eric Cartman,"What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. [Kenny just looks at his meal]"
1836,18,8,Det Harris,"Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?"
1837,18,8,Stuart McCormick,What do you mean?
1838,18,8,Det Harris,"Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it."
1839,18,8,Stuart McCormick,What's cock Magic?
1840,18,8,Det Harris,"Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play ""Magic: the Gathering,"" and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?"
1841,18,8,Stuart McCormick,I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
1842,18,8,Det Harris,"Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong, and anyone I find involved with this filth is goin' down!"
1843,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!"
1844,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, it's not that big a deal."
1845,18,8,Randy Marsh,"It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college."
1846,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,You were?
1847,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. [whips out a handkerchief, and drums begin to play. Randy places the hankey over his pants and begins a demonstration of cock magic, as he knew it]"
1848,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic."
1849,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh? Not impressed? How about this? [makes his penis pop out right, left, down... up, left. Stan hides his face in his hand while his friends are speechless]"
1850,18,8,Voice,What is it?!
1851,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?"
1852,18,8,Voice,"Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters."
1853,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything."
1854,18,8,Breeder,"[The voice, opens up and lets them in] Come on to the back, don't mind the smell. [he takes the boys to his barn and shows them around] We only deal in the highest quality poultry Planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?"
1855,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,We don't... really know the difference.
1856,18,8,Breeder,"Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks."
1857,18,8,Stan Marsh,Do you think they're happy?
1858,18,8,Breeder,Do I think they're happy?
1859,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?"
1860,18,8,Breeder,[thinks a moment] They're fuckin' chickens.
1861,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?"
1862,18,8,Breeder,Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
1863,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny?"
1864,18,8,Stan Marsh,"[off-screen] Hey, how about this little guy?"
1865,18,8,Breeder,That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.
1866,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,Then he's perfect for us.
1867,18,8,Eric Cartman,"What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about ""McNuggets""?"
1868,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
1869,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[mimicking a rooster] ""Yes I do, you guys."" [normally] Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?"
1870,18,8,Shelly Marsh,"Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour!"
1871,18,8,Sharon Marsh,Randy?
1872,18,8,Randy Marsh,[lounge voice] Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
1873,18,8,Sharon Marsh,"[Sharon pounds on the door] Randy, what are you doing?!"
1874,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind. [back to the lounge voice] Hey!"
1875,18,8,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, why are there drums playing? [the drums stop and Randy opens the door]"
1876,18,8,Randy Marsh,"All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback."
1877,18,8,Sharon Marsh,"Ohhh, no no nononononono no."
1878,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college."
1879,18,8,Sharon Marsh,I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
1880,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer."
1881,18,8,Sharon Marsh,Stanley??
1882,18,8,Randy Marsh,"People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh! [a hankey drapes his erect penis] Oh my gosh! [pulls the hankey off and the penis is back in his pants. He smiles, she walks away, his smile fades, and he goes back into the bathroom and shuts the door]"
1883,18,8,Announcer,"Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying! And now he casts Geistflame, dealing one damage to McNuggets."
1884,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[through gritted teeth] Come on, McNuggets! Fight!"
1885,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You can do it, McNuggets! [the crowd argues around them]"
1886,18,8,Announcer,"Quiet, please."
1887,18,8,Someone,I think I'll bet on the next one.
1888,18,8,Announcer,"Waaiitt! [the crowd gets quiet] McNuggets has cast Punishing Fire, absorbing the Geistflame and dealing two damage to the opponent! Game, set and match, McNuggets!"
1889,18,8,Crowd,Whoa!
1890,18,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
1891,18,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, McNuggets!"
1892,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, McNuggets! [after the fights the boys leave City Wok] Did we pick the right rooster or what?!"
1893,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[carrying McNuggets in a small cage] That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls' volleyball."
1894,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,[comes out behind the boys with two bodyguards] Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.
1895,18,8,Eric Cartman,Thank you so very much.
1896,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?
1897,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,You mean there's more to this?
1898,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,"Oh, yes. And I'm not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I'm talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here's the address. [again Kyle takes the slip of paper] Let's see what kind of money your cock can really make."
1899,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Gee, thanks!"
1900,18,8,Eric Cartman,"You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!"
1901,18,8,Woman,"Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on."
1902,18,8,Kindergarten boy,"Yay, a show, a show!"
1903,18,8,Woman,Do you kids like magic?
1904,18,8,Kindergartners,"Yeah, yay!"
1905,18,8,Woman,"Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randy! [leaves as Randy enters, and the kids cheer]"
1906,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Hey kids, are we having fun? [places his hat over his groin, then reaches for it on his head] Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? [no reaction from the kids. Inside, the parents are preparing the cake]"
1907,18,8,Woman,"[mixing some lemonade] Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready."
1908,18,8,Randy Marsh,"[with his penis in a box and a saw in his left hand] Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic... [begins to saw through the box] you'll find that- [the saw hits something that produces gushes of blood. All the kids are hit and they panic] Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!"
1909,18,8,Man,"[chuckles] They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?"
1910,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?! [the girl reaches behind her ear and pulls out a detached penis. She screams and Randy takes it from her.] Oh, it was behind her ear. [goes back to the stage and pops it right back where it should be, hidden so the kids don't see what he's actually doing] And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randy! Thank you! [kids are still screaming]"
1911,18,8,Kindergarten boy,I hate you!
1912,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit."
1913,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
1914,18,8,Craig Tucker,Where was all this?
1915,18,8,Eric Cartman,"We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit."
1916,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you gotta know people."
1917,18,8,Butters Stotch,"Dangit, I wish I knew people."
1918,18,8,Mr Garrison,"All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls' volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. [goes to his desk as she enters]"
1919,18,8,Girls Volleyball Coach,"Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout."
1920,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh Jesus, give it a rest already."
1921,18,8,Butters Stotch,[chuckling] Yeah.
1922,18,8,Girls Volleyball Coach,"You know, when you put your all into something, it's kind of a bummer when people don't seem to care. [focus on Kenny, who looks down] Kind of makes you feel like the sport you love is becoming a joke."
1923,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill."
1924,18,8,Eric Cartman,OOHHH!! [laughs with the other boys]
1925,18,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Fantastic girls' volleyball joke, Stan."
1926,18,8,Girls Volleyball Coach,"The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls' volleyball team."
1927,18,8,Wendy Testaburger,"[gets up and goes to the front of the class. Stan is immediately stunned] Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. [goes back to her seat]"
1928,18,8,Eric Cartman,"[aside, to Stan] Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that."
1929,18,8,Man,"And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh."
1930,18,8,Det Harris,Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? [the man and wife look at each other]
1931,18,8,Man,Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.
1932,18,8,Det Harris,"Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?"
1933,18,8,Woman,Decks??
1934,18,8,Man,"Who? There weren't any ""decks."""
1935,18,8,Det Harris,"Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?"
1936,18,8,Woman,"[in tears] I'm so confused, babe."
1937,18,8,Det Harris,Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
1938,18,8,Man,"Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!"
1939,18,8,Det Harris,Agreed! Who first called 911? [moments later the woman is being taken to a squad car as the man and their daughter look on]
1940,18,8,Woman,Please! Don't take me away from my child!
1941,18,8,Girl 1,[crying] Mommy!
1942,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
1943,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. [they stand before Panda Express. Again, Kyle knocks on the doors and tugs at them.]"
1944,18,8,Panda Express Manager,"[opens the door] Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!"
1945,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic."
1946,18,8,Panda Express Manager,"Oh okay, come on, ten dorrah, ten dorrah."
1947,18,8,Eric Cartman,Ten dorrah?! [the boys hand over $10 each]
1948,18,8,Announcer 2,"For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky."
1949,18,8,Eric Cartman,Who is that??
1950,18,8,Spectator 1,"That's Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. [Gadnuk is wearing a gold medallion] He's never lost a fight. Hell, he's never even lost one health!"
1951,18,8,Stan Marsh,[following the cock Magic fight over the phone] What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
1952,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!"
1953,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
1954,18,8,Eric Cartman,"McNuggets is scared, dude!"
1955,18,8,Stan Marsh,Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
1956,18,8,Spectator 2,[returns to the crowd with a dead bird] He didn't stand a chance. Not one spell cast before he was obliterated by health drains! That thing isn't human! [walks away with his rooster. Gadnuk throws down a card. The promoter walks up]
1957,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,"Alright, your rooster's up next, boys."
1958,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude."
1959,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,He doesn't have a choice.
1960,18,8,Eric Cartman,This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
1961,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,What do you think all these people are here to see?
1962,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!"
1963,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,The hell you do! Get your cock in there! [Kenny sighs and goes in instead]
1964,18,8,ESPN Announcer,"You're watching ESPN Illegal, your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic."
1965,18,8,ESPN Host,"And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move. [Gadnuk ponders what to do while Kenny slowly taps his fingers on the table, waiting] Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds plays a creature card. [his assistant places it on the table]"
1966,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack."
1967,18,8,Crowd,Whooaa.
1968,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Kenny! [Kenny take a card from a deck and looks through his other cards]"
1969,18,8,Stan Marsh,What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
1970,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health."
1971,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,He just had to shuffle it.
1972,18,8,Eric Cartman,Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer.
1973,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Does an Overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! [meanwhile, the ball goes to #36, who hits it back over the net]"
1974,18,8,ESPN Host,"A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH, and he's just laid down Life's Legacy!"
1975,18,8,Crowd,Ooooohh...
1976,18,8,ESPN Host,That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!
1977,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Holy shit, dude!"
1978,18,8,ESPN Host,"Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this!"
1979,18,8,Det Harris,"Freeze! [comes down to the basement with reinforcements. The cops draw their guns and check everyone out there. One cop pulls a gun from a spectator's jacket and throws it to the ground] Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time! [looks at Kenny] Especially you, scumbag!"
1980,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,Lousy cops! How did you find us?
1981,18,8,Det Harris,"We saw your fliers. [holds one up] ""Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm."""
1982,18,8,Cock Magic Promoter,We didn't put those fliers out!
1983,18,8,Announcer,"[spotlights come on and move out over the crowd] And now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the Amazingly Randy! [A stage is lit up and Randy bounds out]"
1984,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Ah, dude, your dad's here."
1985,18,8,Randy Marsh,"[lounge voice] Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing. [dances over to a stool nearby with a box sitting on it] Whatever you believe is real, is real. [pulls out a hankey, then goes back to center stage and shows there's nothing odd about it. He unzips his zipper and puts the hankey on his penis. He gets a rubber band and ties the hankey around the penis. Next he moves his hand around and his penis rises in response, as if his hands had some magnetic power to them. Suddenly, the penis takes flight and goes around several times. He holds up a large ring and the penis flies through it flawlessly. He turns around and the song ""Barbie Girl"" plays. He drops his pants, dances a bit, then turns around with a small curtain over his legs. The penis peaks out to the right, up, left, and then a life-size head appears popping out to the right]"
1986,18,8,Head,"Come on Barbie, let's go party. [Randy pushes it gently behind the curtain again, then he squats just long enough to get his pants back up and remove the curtain. Then he hops around. He hops back to the stool and gets some body lotion to lubricate his penis with. Then he pretends to stroke his penis and a bouquet of flowers pops up. He tosses the bouquet into the crowd and a woman catches it]"
1987,18,8,Spectator 3,Ewww! [throws the bouquet away]
1988,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?"
1989,18,8,Det Harris,I'll volunteer.
1990,18,8,Randy Marsh,"Alright, come on up here. [Harris goes up] What's your name?"
1991,18,8,Det Harris,"I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police."
1992,18,8,Randy Marsh,"All right, a hand for Detective Harris! [applause. This provides a distraction by which some spectators leave silently] You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals. [grabs a tank of liquid nitrogen] Sir? [gives it to Harris, who holds it. Drumroll. Randy takes a funnel and puts one end on his penis, then motions for Harris to pour the nitrogen into the funnel. A few seconds later, the funnel comes off to reveal a frozen penis. Randy takes a gun out and shoots it to bits. Harris is stunned. Randy walks over to him and smiles. All of a sudden, the penis comes out of Harris' mouth. Randy take it and puts it into his pants. Harris smiles. Only four cops remain and they clap. The crowd and the other cops have left.]"
1993,18,8,Eric Cartman,"It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up."
1994,18,8,Butters Stotch,"Wow, the cops came?"
1995,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened."
1996,18,8,Eric Cartman,"Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?"
1997,18,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)"
1998,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?"
1999,18,8,Stan Marsh,"Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys."
2000,18,8,Kyle Broflovski,Got what?
2001,18,8,Stan Marsh,A way to finally do something good for other people.
2002,18,8,Announcer,"South Park serves, and McNuggets plays a Plains Land card. One-nil, South Park. [a smattering of applause. Wendy serves again] Another serve, and McNuggets summons Downtreader Elk. One South Park player is eliminated. You, the girl with the ponytails - you are dead."
2003,18,9,Gerald Broflovski,"There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley."
2004,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together."
2005,18,9,Gerald Broflovski,It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
2006,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship."
2007,18,9,Gerald Broflovski,"All right. [Kyle smiles, Gerald heads back to the kitchen] I swear I'll never understand you kids these days."
2008,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yes! [runs upstairs smiling.]
2009,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Heeey Ike! Look what I got. [Ike looks over his shoulder] The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
2010,18,9,PewDiePie,"[on the monitor] Aww, look at all the bright colors."
2011,18,9,Ike Broflovski,...Meh. [goes back to watching the monitor and eating his Cheetos]
2012,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!"
2013,18,9,Ike Broflovski,"Maybe later, 'kay?"
2014,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up to Ike] Well what are you watching?
2015,18,9,PewDiePie,"How's it goin' bros? My name's PewDiePie. I'm playing Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Here we go. [breaks through a door and is met with gunfire] Agh! People are shooting at me, bros!"
2016,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
2017,18,9,Ike Broflovski,[claps] PewDiePie!
2018,18,9,PewDiePie,There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
2019,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?"
2020,18,9,PewDiePie,"All right, I hope that's enough."
2021,18,9,Ike Broflovski,Meh.
2022,18,9,PewDiePie,"Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig! [fires away at will]"
2023,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days."
2024,18,9,Butters Stotch,What's a PewDiePie do?
2025,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame."
2026,18,9,Eric Cartman,"He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?"
2027,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!"
2028,18,9,Concert Announcer,"This Saturday, at the Pepsi Center, it's Women of Rock! Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, Nicki Minaj, and Lorde! [Randy] All on one stage, on one night! With a special appearance by Michael Jackson's Hologram!"
2029,18,9,MJ Hologram,Hee hee!
2030,18,9,Concert Announcer,"Ticket proceeds help fight the gluten crisis in West Africa! It's a night of pure, pure estrogen! Tickets on sale now! [TeleChargeIt and TicketMastering info go up]"
2031,18,9,Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!"
2032,18,9,Record Executive,"Come on, this is a great lineup."
2033,18,9,Randy,"Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no."
2034,18,9,Record Executive,I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
2035,18,9,Randy,What is that supposed to mean?
2036,18,9,Record Executive,I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
2037,18,9,Randy,"Yes, Freemium gaming."
2038,18,9,Record Executive,"I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush. [Randy sighs] You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over. [hangs up. Randy ends the call]"
2039,18,9,Randy,I love Candy Crush.
2040,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
2041,18,9,Stan Marsh,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
2042,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary."
2043,18,9,Kenny McCormick,(Commentary?)
2044,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! [Cartman eyes his phone with Stan and Kenny look at Kyle]"
2045,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. [a recording of the earlier conversation plays]"
2046,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
2047,18,9,Eric Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan."
2048,18,9,Stan Marsh,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
2049,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what."
2050,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it."
2051,18,9,Kenny McCormick,(Commentary?)
2052,18,9,Eric Cartman,There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
2053,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
2054,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! [anxiously waits for an answer]"
2055,18,9,Sharon,"I don't know, Shelly."
2056,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! [Randy and Sharon turn around]"
2057,18,9,Randy,"Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up."
2058,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!"
2059,18,9,Randy,And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
2060,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!"
2061,18,9,Randy,"You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow."
2062,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh",So can I go or not?!
2063,18,9,Randy,If she means that much to you.
2064,18,9,"Randy, Sharon, and Shelly Marsh","Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. [smiles and walks away]"
2065,18,9,Sharon,Sooo you're doing it? [smiles]
2066,18,9,Randy,How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
2067,18,9,Sharon,Of course not. [Randy walks away and out of earshot] Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
2068,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty."
2069,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[goes into the room] Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?"
2070,18,9,Eric Cartman,"More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start."
2071,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!"
2072,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
2073,18,9,Eric Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan."
2074,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,[approaches the monitor] What the fuck?!
2075,18,9,Stan Marsh,I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
2076,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what."
2077,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!"
2078,18,9,Eric Cartman,"God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!"
2079,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
2080,18,9,Ike Broflovski,CartmaaanBrah!
2081,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,What do you think you're doing?!
2082,18,9,Eric Cartman,Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
2083,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
2084,18,9,Eric Cartman,I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
2085,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
2086,18,9,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about?
2087,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
2088,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle."
2089,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Let's Plays?
2090,18,9,Eric Cartman,"That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. [turns to the basket and takes his shot. Kyle looks away and down]"
2091,18,9,Miley Cyrus,"There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
Throw my hands in the air while I'm twerkin' this chair
There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
And I'm movin' my hands while I'm shakin' my tits."
2092,18,9,Stagehand,"Alright guys, Uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde. [walks out of the dressing room backwards] Have a great show, ladies."
2093,18,9,Randy,"Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work."
2094,18,9,Record Executive,"You're nervous, it's understandable."
2095,18,9,Randy,No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
2096,18,9,Record Executive,"You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit."
2097,18,9,Randy,Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
2098,18,9,Iggy Azalea,"Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!"
2099,18,9,Randy,"No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models."
2100,18,9,Iggy Azalea,"That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!"
2101,18,9,Randy,"Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you."
2102,18,9,Iggy Azalea,'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!
2103,18,9,Randy,Fuck you! [they start fighting and break through a table full of finger good and drinks]
2104,18,9,Record Executive,Alright that's enough! [breaks up the scuffle and separates the two artists] Look at yourselves!
2105,18,9,Iggy Azalea,"You're an Internet bullshit artist, Lorde!"
2106,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what's up?"
2107,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're not gonna believe this.
2108,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, what now?"
2109,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition."
2110,18,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
2111,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Come on! [leads Stan upstairs]
2112,18,9,PewDiePie,[giggling] He's just laying there.
2113,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
2114,18,9,PewDiePie,"I'm going ""Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun."""
2115,18,9,Kindergarten Kids,[in unison] PewDiePie!
2116,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
2117,18,9,Butters Stotch,Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
2118,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!"
2119,18,9,Kindergarten Kids,CartmanBrah!
2120,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!"
2121,18,9,Conner,"Okay Grandpa, we'll be sure to keep that in mind. [the kids laugh]"
2122,18,9,Stan Marsh,Grandpa?
2123,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"This is how they talk to us! [to Conner] You'd better watch your mouth, kid!"
2124,18,9,Kid 1,"Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember?"
2125,18,9,Kid 2,It's best to just make old people think they matter.
2126,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!"
2127,18,9,Kid 2,No sir. Thank goodness we have you to do that. [Ike laughs at PewDiePie's gameplay]
2128,18,9,Stan Marsh,We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
2129,18,9,PewDiePie,Oh my God I killed him!
2130,18,9,Iggy Azalea,"Missy who who?
That's all I do is rip off Missy.
Missy who?
Missy who? Missy who? Missy who who? Missy who who?


Alright bitches and hos, via hologram and shit, Michael Jackson! [two men from the Syntech Hologram Company get ready]"
2131,18,9,Tech 1,"And, cue the hologram! [a bunch of special lights come on and produce the hologram, and the hologram performs Michael's signature moves. The crowd goes wild as Michael's music plays. The hologram moonwalks like Michael did]"
2132,18,9,MJ Hologram,"Hee hee. [as the crowd roars, Iggy starts twerking to the hologram]"
2133,18,9,Randy,They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
2134,18,9,Nicki Minaj,"Oh Lorde, you're such a purist."
2135,18,9,Randy,"Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something."
2136,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,Hi everybody. I love you!
2137,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,Thanks for loving me. I love you too.
2138,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,"So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy?? [the audience cheers in agreement] Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! [Instead of Cartman himself appearing on the couch, Cartman's commenter window pops up - he's doing this via satellite]"
2139,18,9,Eric Cartman,CartmaaanBrah!
2140,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
2141,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well."
2142,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,And why do you think young people-?
2143,18,9,Eric Cartman,CartmaaanBrah!
2144,18,9,Wendy Williams and her Audience,...Why do you think young people are responding to this? [Cartman mocks the question by asking it back in nonsense syllables] I'm asking you a question! [Cartman continues with the nonsense replies]
2145,18,9,Eric Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs."
2146,18,9,MC,"And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE!"
2147,18,9,Randy,"Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there! [begins playing an acoustic guitar. Shelly is in the audience with Kelly and Stacy] Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya. [the cheering dies down] Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy. [the mood of the audience begins to change] Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya. [the audience begins to boo] And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh. [turns right and the mic falls to the ground] Oh God. Sorry. [bends over to pick up the mic...] Uh hold on.[...but drops the guitar instead. The boos intensify] Hang on, uh. [to bail Lorde out of this mess, the technicians bring Michael's hologram back to the stage]"
2148,18,9,MJ Hologram,Hee hee. [the hologram runs through the audience] I'm free! I'm free!
2149,18,9,Randy,"[dusts himself off] Sorry folks, just one second here."
2150,18,9,MJ Hologram,Hee hee. Dah dadit dat ja!
2151,18,9,Guard 1,"Stop him. [another guard tries to grab the hologram, but realizes it can't be done. The hologram leaves the Center. The guards run out after it, and a guard guard gets on his walkie-talkie]"
2152,18,9,Guard 1,Michael Jackson's hologram is on the loose!
2153,18,9,MJ Hologram,[leaving the parking area] Hee hee!
2154,18,9,Randy,"Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a. [the boos don't stop, and Randy's vision becomes prismatic] Okay, uh, uh... [steps aside and begins to simulate rubbing his ""clit""] Oooo![hops onto the car on stage and continues the simulation] Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! [the boos are replaced by disgust. Shelly and friends are disappointed]"
2155,18,9,Lorde Fan,"Ogh! Lorde, ewww!"
2156,18,9,Randy,"Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! [fans begin to walk out of the concert]"
2157,18,9,Randy,"Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan? [Stan reaches to his left and passes the potatoes to Randy] Great, thanks. [serves himself some potatoes] Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?"
2158,18,9,Stan Marsh,"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?"
2159,18,9,Randy,I was told to!
2160,18,9,Sharon,"You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit."
2161,18,9,Randy,"Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! [Stan hisses and leaves the table. Sharon just leaves. Some time later, Randy drops in on Shelly in her room and sees her crying on her bed, face down. He then notices that the Lorde poster on the wall is in tatters and ripped in half. Randy leaves and closes the door softly]"
2162,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's dying. The living room is... dying.
2163,18,9,Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?"
2164,18,9,Record Executive,What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
2165,18,9,Randy,"Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-"
2166,18,9,Record Executive,"It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!"
2167,18,9,Randy,This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
2168,18,9,Passenger,"Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?"
2169,18,9,MJ Hologram,Yes.
2170,18,9,Passenger,"You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'?"
2171,18,9,MJ Hologram,"No, I just need to... take care of some im-, important business."
2172,18,9,Passenger,"Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman?"
2173,18,9,MJ Hologram,"Yes. I mean, yes, that's all. I'm, I'm just gonna fish and hunt."
2174,18,9,Passenger,"Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon?"
2175,18,9,MJ Hologram,[stands up] Nobody! That's ignorant!
2176,18,9,Passenger,"Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey?"
2177,18,9,MJ Hologram,Allegedly! Allegedly! That's ignorant!
2178,18,9,Passenger,"You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent."
2179,18,9,MJ Hologram,...That's ignorant. I'm just cold.
2180,18,9,Passenger,I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.
2181,18,9,MJ Hologram,"Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant!"
2182,18,9,Passenger,"[looks him over] Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it."
2183,18,9,MJ Hologram,"Oh I will. Trust me, I will. [The bus enters South Park.]"
2184,18,9,Tech 2,"Ah, we've lost any ability to track the hologram's location. Ih...it looks like it reprogrammed its guidance systems."
2185,18,9,Record Executive,We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back!
2186,18,9,Tech 3,Project Alpha?
2187,18,9,Tech 4,Yes. That might be our only option.
2188,18,9,Record Executive,What is Project Alpha?
2189,18,9,Tech 4,The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-
2190,18,9,Tech 3,Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha!
2191,18,9,Tech 2,"Sir, are you sure that we wanna-?"
2192,18,9,Tech 3,Bring it up! [Tech 2 gets to work. Everyone turns around and watches as the hologram is assembled]
2193,18,9,Record Executive,What is that?
2194,18,9,Tech 3,Tupac.
2195,18,9,Tech 4,"[approaches the hologram] Tupac? [the hologram is activated] Yo. The hologram of Michael Jackson is on the loose. We need you to ""take care of the situation."" [the hologram takes out a Glock hologram and cocks it, then he walks forward, then turns left and walks out]"
2196,18,9,Tech 3,"Godspeed, Tupac."
2197,18,9,Man,"Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I told you them homies didn't cap his ass! [Tupac opens the driver's door, pulls the driver out and throws him to the ground, then gets into the driver's seat and takes off with the car and driver's wife. The driver gets up and pulls out his phone] Oh, this is going on Instagram! [takes the picture]"
2198,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now. [the other three boys walk into view] Yep, there's Kyle, Stan and Kenny looking stupid as ever."
2199,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
2200,18,9,Stan Marsh,Tell me about it.
2201,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!"
2202,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV."
2203,18,9,Eric Cartman,[exasperated] Oh God.
2204,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,[notices the commenter window above the bus stop sign] Do you mind?!
2205,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated"
2206,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
2207,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!"
2208,18,9,Randy,Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. [the executive puts down his fork and wipes his lips off with a napkin.]
2209,18,9,Record Executive,"Sit down, Lorde."
2210,18,9,Randy,I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
2211,18,9,Record Executive,"[stands up and walks to a nearby bar] Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more. [pours himself a drink] Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on. [turns around] The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level."
2212,18,9,Randy,Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
2213,18,9,Record Executive,On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
2214,18,9,Randy,I'll do no such thing!
2215,18,9,Record Executive,"Who said anything about you? [whips out a small remote control and presses a button on it. Some lasers turn on and assemble a new hologram. It's Lorde's hologram. It walks up to the executive and stands beside him. Randy is frightened and takes several steps back. Two bodyguards appear behind him, and he notices. The executive closes the blinds]"
2216,18,9,Randy,You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
2217,18,9,Record Executive,"Today, commentary IS the content. And you, I'm afraid, are just in the way. [the bodyguards quickly escort him out]"
2218,18,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle."
2219,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to the front of the class and turns around. He reads from a sheet of paper] What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-"
2220,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up] Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake."
2221,18,9,Mr Garrison,What the hell is that?
2222,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
2223,18,9,Eric Cartman,Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
2224,18,9,Mr Garrison,What the hell?
2225,18,9,Eric Cartman,"This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison."
2226,18,9,Butters Stotch,It's true!
2227,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch."
2228,18,9,Butters Stotch,Heheyehah.
2229,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
2230,18,9,Eric Cartman,[mocking] There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
2231,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!"
2232,18,9,Mr Garrison,I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
2233,18,9,Kyle Broflovski,THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
2234,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[mocking] This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something."
2235,18,9,Mr Mackey,"Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!"
2236,18,9,Eric Cartman,What the hell did I do?
2237,18,9,Principal Victoria,"Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction."
2238,18,9,Eric Cartman,Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
2239,18,9,Principal Victoria,"Eric, I am talking to YOU!"
2240,18,9,Eric Cartman,Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
2241,18,9,Randy,Sharon? Sharon!
2242,18,9,Sharon,[comes down the stairs in her bath robe] Randy? What's going on?
2243,18,9,Randy,"They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!"
2244,18,9,Sharon,"Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?"
2245,18,9,Randy,The hologram's in our bedroom?
2246,18,9,Sharon,Yes!
2247,18,9,Tupac s Hologram,"I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit."
2248,18,9,Randy,You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
2249,18,9,Record Executive,"It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?"
2250,18,9,Eric Cartman,"[in his commenter window] Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!"
2251,18,9,Record Executive,Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
2252,18,9,Eric Cartman,"Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!"
2253,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
[leaves the menorah and stops by Ike's room, and looks in]
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.

[Ike is watching ""Call of Duty"" on his computer]"
2254,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up on screen] Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!"
2255,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
[Kyle looks at the floor, turns back and walks away. he stops by the kitchen, then by his dad's study. Gerald takes a selfie with his pet project: a model of a ship]
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.

[he walks through the living room, then stops and looks around]
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,

[he looks at the TV and walks up to it]
What brought families together most was a good old TV

[he walks through the park with his head down]
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.

[he sees a little girl on a bench looking at her iPhone]
And if you try to complain, you get called a-"
2256,18,10,Girl on Park Bench,Grandpa!
2257,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
2258,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[Now at his own desk]
But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.

[The following is the tweet]
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom

[finishes the tweet but doesn't submit it yet. He's wearing a tee shirt with #savethelivingroom on it]"
2259,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Whattaya think?
2260,18,10,Butters Stotch,"Hmmm, it's kind of gay."
2261,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Really??
2262,18,10,Butters Stotch,"I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?"
2263,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome."""
2264,18,10,Butters Stotch,"Well, gay is wholesome."
2265,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values."
2266,18,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[knocks, then enters] Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you."
2267,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Bill Cosby.
2268,18,10,Sheila Broflovski,Yes.
2269,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Is here. To see me.
2270,18,10,Sheila Broflovski,Yes. [turns around and leaves]
2271,18,10,Bill Cosby,Oh! There he is comin' down the stairs.
2272,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hello.
2273,18,10,Bill Cosby,"Hello, son. Your savethelivingroom hash tag is getting a lot of attention and we think it's great."
2274,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,We?
2275,18,10,Bill Cosby,"I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend. [notices how dusty the TV is and wipes some of the dust off with his right hand] It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now."
2276,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. [smiles] Well that's awesome!
2277,18,10,Bill Cosby,Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
2278,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"M-Ah, I'd love to."
2279,18,10,Bill Cosby,Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!
2280,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Uh okay! No problem! [Bill lets himself out]
2281,18,10,Bill Cosby,"This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son!"
2282,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!"
2283,18,10,Bill Cosby,"Happy Holidays! [Kyle closes the door, and Bill's glitch appears as he walks away - this Bill is a hologram]"
2284,18,10,Det Harris,"Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?"
2285,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it."
2286,18,10,Officer 1,[with mustache] Who's the famous artist?
2287,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde."
2288,18,10,Det Harris,You're Lorde.
2289,18,10,Sharon Marsh,"The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him."
2290,18,10,Officer 1,You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
2291,18,10,Randy Marsh,No! That was a copy of me!
2292,18,10,Officer 2,Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh! [bemused smile which quickly fades.]
2293,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!"
2294,18,10,Officer 3,[runs into the station] Detective Harris! Sir! We've got a problem!
2295,18,10,Det Harris,"[turns around] What is it, Adams?"
2296,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams",[Officer 3] We've arrested a black man who was snooping around the old Jefferson estate!
2297,18,10,Det Harris,Did you choke him?
2298,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams",Yes!
2299,18,10,Det Harris,Did you shoot him?
2300,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams",YES!
2301,18,10,Det Harris,So what's the problem?
2302,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams","He... appears to be just a hologram, sir."
2303,18,10,MJ s Hologram,"[brought in by another officer, somehow handcuffed] Naw, it's ignorant! You don't understand! We have to stop them! Heee hee!"
2304,18,10,Det Harris,Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
2305,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[excitedly] Dude, what are you doing?!"
2306,18,10,Stan Marsh,[texting] Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
2307,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!"
2308,18,10,Stan Marsh,Who did?
2309,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"These producers making a big holiday special! [goes to the TV and wipes it clean] They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!"
2310,18,10,Stan Marsh,"That's a little strange, isn't it?"
2311,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!"
2312,18,10,Announcer,"From the producers of Women Of Rock Live and The Rockefeller Tree Lighting Ceremony, it's the holiday television event of the season!

2314,18,10,Announcer,And featuring live commentary the entire show by CartmanBrah.
2315,18,10,Eric Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?"
2316,18,10,Announcer,There's something for every generation to bring families together.
2317,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room."
2318,18,10,Eric Cartman,He's such a douchebag.
2319,18,10,Announcer,It's all live and it's all magical. It's the Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special.
2320,18,10,Eric Cartman,Now we're talkin'! [the commenter window disappears and Stan and Kyle are stunned]
2321,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,That son of a bitch!
2322,18,10,Stan Marsh,That self-promoting asshole!
2323,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Why would he do this?!
2324,18,10,Stan Marsh,Because my dad's an idiot!
2325,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!"
2326,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Nnnothing, nothing."
2327,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. [eats some chips]"
2328,18,10,Exec 1,"So far the holiday special is trending fine, but it appears that the Michael Jackson hologram is the most heavily tweeted."
2329,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,And we still have no idea where the damned hologram is?
2330,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down."
2331,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut."
2332,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"We got one shot at this, people! This [pounds his fist on the table] has to be the holiday special to end all holiday specials!"
2333,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??"
2334,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,He's got his finger on the pulse of young America.
2335,18,10,Exec 2,"Sir, I'm pretty sure that [reads from his phone] ""Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special"" is not a good name."
2336,18,10,Eric Cartman,"No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!"
2337,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"[leans in] If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power!"
2338,18,10,Eric Cartman,"I can hear you, douchebag."
2339,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"People, you know what we're trying to do here. [leaves his desk and paces the room] We're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. That means being hip, being now."
2340,18,10,Eric Cartman,These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
2341,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"There, you see that? ""Blumpkin catchers."" Do any of you even know what that means? This kid is our way to connect with the youth of America, and I'm gonna give him all the power he needs."
2342,18,10,Eric Cartman,G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
2343,18,10,Officer 4,"What about this, sir? Burnt sienna?"
2344,18,10,Det Harris,"He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!"
2345,18,10,Officer 1,"I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown."
2346,18,10,Det Harris,That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
2347,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde."
2348,18,10,MJ s hologram,"Who? Lorde? You're not Lorde, that's ignorant."
2349,18,10,Randy Marsh,Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
2350,18,10,MJ s hologram,They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant! It's gonna be the most ignorant holiday special ever!
2351,18,10,Randy Marsh,A holiday special. Oh my God.
2352,18,10,MJ s hologram,It's directed at children! We have to stop them!
2353,18,10,Officer 4,Huh how about we say he's mixed race?
2354,18,10,Det Harris,"As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay."
2355,18,10,Randy Marsh,[to Sharon] I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special! [to MJ's hologram] Can you help me stop them?!
2356,18,10,MJ s hologram,Yes. We have to reach the children. It's our only hope.
2357,18,10,Randy Marsh,Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
2358,18,10,MJ s hologram,[stands up] ALLEGEDLY! [the officers look at him] THAT WAS A CIVIL SUIT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE! [sits down] It's ignorant.
2359,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Mom?! Where is Ike?!
2360,18,10,Sheila Broflovski,Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
2361,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
2362,18,10,Sheila Broflovski,He's upstairs playing with all his friends.
2363,18,10,PewDiePie,"Oh my God, that's the ugliest..."
2364,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!"
2365,18,10,Kid 2,Old people are so funny.
2366,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner",They really just don't get it.
2367,18,10,Kid 3,And they smell like soap.
2368,18,10,Stan Marsh,"We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!"
2369,18,10,Kid 4,"Careful Grandpa, you might crap your Depends! [the kids laugh, even Ike]"
2370,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
2371,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you damn kids!"
2372,18,10,PewDiePie,...that's the lamest...
2373,18,10,Det Harris,"Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?"
2374,18,10,Front Desk Officer,Can I help you? [the hologram looks at him and moves away] Eh-excuse me. Can I help you? [the hologram moves deeper into the building. A security camera shows him walking down a hallway. The front desk officer runs into the office] Sir? A black guy walked into the police station!
2375,18,10,Det Harris,"Heh, uh huh? [looks at the officer and grins]"
2376,18,10,Front Desk Officer,"Well a, a black guy walked into the police station."
2377,18,10,Det Harris,"[chuckling, anticipating a joke] Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one. [Mitchell appears in the background] Start over: what's the setup?"
2378,18,10,Front Desk Officer,"There's this black guy, walked into the police station."
2379,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams","Oh yeah, I think I've heard it, but go ahead."
2380,18,10,Front Desk Officer,"No, really, a black guy walked into the-!"
2381,18,10,"Det. Harris and Police Officers, including the Front Desk Officer, Peterson, and Mitchell Adams","Ohhh ya ya ya? ""We set who free?"""
2382,18,10,Front Desk Officer,"No no, a black guy literally walked into the police station!"
2383,18,10,Det Harris,"Oh, it's a new one. [Tupac's hologram walks in] Aw, shit! Look out! [the officers quickly draw their weapons]"
2384,18,10,Officer 4,It's a black guy! Choke him!
2385,18,10,Det Harris,Shoot him!
2386,18,10,Officer 4,"Shoot him and then choke him! [the front desk officer shoots the hologram, but the bullet just goes through and disrupts the hologram's structural integrity. The officer tries to choke the hologram, but the arms just go through it]"
2387,18,10,MJ s hologram,He's here to kill us! Run!! Heee heee! [they escape while the officers shoot at Tupac's hologram. They go down the fire escape unnoticed]
2388,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, open this door right now!"
2389,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window pops up] Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!"
2390,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing?!
2391,18,10,Eric Cartman,"What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible."
2392,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
2393,18,10,Eric Cartman,How do you even know I'm here in my room?
2394,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Because you just said, ""here in my room""!"
2395,18,10,Eric Cartman,"...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions. [Kyle tries breaking his way into the room] You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. [Kyle stops]"
2396,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!"
2397,18,10,Eric Cartman,Why does that matter?
2398,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Because Lorde is my dad, alright?! [walks forward as his anger drains away] Lorde is my dad."
2399,18,10,Eric Cartman,What?
2400,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you talking about, Stan?"
2401,18,10,Stan Marsh,He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
2402,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. [the commenter window disappears]"
2403,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped."
2404,18,10,Stan Marsh,It just all seemed so... stupid.
2405,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
2406,18,10,Sharon Marsh,See if it started!
2407,18,10,Randy Marsh,"We don't really use this thing anymore. [grabs the remote and turns on the TV] It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!"
2408,18,10,Sharon Marsh,"[puts her hand on Randy's shoulder] Randy, what about Shelly?"
2409,18,10,Randy Marsh,Oh my God...
2410,18,10,MJ s hologram,Shelly? Who's Shelly? That's ignorant.
2411,18,10,Randy Marsh,My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
2412,18,10,Sharon Marsh,How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
2413,18,10,Randy Marsh,I guess... one step at a time.
2414,18,10,Randy Marsh,"Shelly? Um, I'm Lorde. [she sits up a little] All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. [blows her a kiss and closes the door, then to Michael's hologram]Whew, that was hard."
2415,18,10,Sharon Marsh,RANDY?! [Randy and Michael's hologram head downstairs[

2419,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, this should be good."
2420,18,10,Kurt s hologram,"[begins to sing]
Up on the housetop, reindeer pawsOut jumps good ole Santa Claus"
2421,18,10,Eric Cartman,I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
2422,18,10,Kurt s hologram,"Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, girls and boys [reaches to his left for a rifle and waves it around as if marching]
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go
Yeh-he-he-eah who wouldn't go [loads and cocks the rifle]
Up on the housetop clickity click click [aims it at his mouth as if to shoot himself]
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick? [waves it around again, then stops]"
2423,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Hoh, this should get some comments. [Kurt's hologram fires the rifle and a small flag saying ""Merry Christmas"" pops out. He grins]"

2429,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"No no, thank you! [wipes his lips clean] If you hadn't called, I... wouldn't know what I know now. [gets up and walks towards the bar, dialing a number in the process]"
2430,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again."
2431,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,It's me. I've got somethin' you might be interested in.
2432,18,10,Randy Marsh,"[on the line in the master bedroom] I don't think so, you son of a bitch! [Sharon and Michael's hologram are also there]"
2433,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"I've got your son here, Lorde. If you don't cooperate, he dies."
2434,18,10,Stan Marsh,What?? [both he and Kyle are scared]
2435,18,10,Randy Marsh,Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!

2437,18,10,Randy Marsh,"THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON! [just as he reaches the front door, it opens and Tupac's hologram walks in] SHIT!! [runs to the back door.]"
2438,18,10,Det Harris,"[on his bullhorn] All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!"
2439,18,10,Officer 5,"[runs up] Sir! You'd better see this! [holds out a phone, which Detective Harris looks at] There's something new trending! #copscantgoaroundchokingblackpeople."
2440,18,10,Det Harris,"We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're workiing on it!"
2441,18,10,Officer 6,"No, sir, I I think they mean we shouldn't. Like we're racist or something."
2442,18,10,Det Harris,What?! We're not racists.
2443,18,10,Peterson,"Sir, we've got confirmation. There's two black guys in the upstairs of the house!"
2444,18,10,Det Harris,"[turns around anticipating another joke] Uh huh, go ahead."
2445,18,10,Peterson,Two black guys. One of them is threatening the other one.
2446,18,10,Det Harris,"Yehah? Hang on! Mitch! [Mitchell appears again] Two black guys in the upstairs of the house. One of them is threatening the other one. [to Peterson] Okay, go ahead."

2454,18,10,Controller 2,It's incredible! I've never seen trending like this!
2455,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,[turns around] We're trending well?
2456,18,10,Controller 1,We're barely trending at all. But #ihatecartmanbrah is trending off the charts!
2457,18,10,Controller 2,He's right. ihatecartmanbrah is trending at 96% and climbing.
2458,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,That's impossible.
2459,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
2460,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"It was five years ago that I... became a grandpa. At first it was wonderful. I wanted to show my grandson everything. Teach him all about the entertainment business. One day I aasked him, ""Who's your favorite celebrity?"" You know what he said to me? He said, ""PeewwDiePie."" I had no idea who [turns around] he was talking about. So I looked it up. And he was this insignificant little game blogger from Sweden who my grandson thought was a god! No matter who else I tried to impress him with, he would just say, ""Meh."" To me! MEH! [turns back to the bar] What the hell is wrong with these kids today?? With this special, we will assimilate this generation's culture into ours! MAKE THEM APPRECIATE REAL ENTERTAINMENT, DAMNIT! [pounds theh bar with his fist]"
2461,18,10,Stan Marsh,Dude. You're such a grandpa.
2462,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,[angrily clears everything off the bar] I AM NOT A GRANDPAAA!
2463,18,10,Taylor Swift,Well I guess it's time to leave.
2464,18,10,Bill s hologram,Oh but it's snowin' out dere.
2465,18,10,Taylor Swift,Yeah but I need to get home.
2466,18,10,Bill s hologram,But it's snowin' out dere.
2467,18,10,Taylor Swift,I really should go
2468,18,10,Bill s hologram,Oh what's the hurry?
2469,18,10,Taylor Swift,"Say, what's in this drink?"
2470,18,10,Bill s hologram,That's just some J-E-L-L-O.
2471,18,10,Taylor Swift,The holidays are comin'-
2472,18,10,Dad and Mom,This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen.
2473,18,10,Dad and Mom,Maybe we should turn it off.
2474,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Oh wow, where are we now, brahs? [the family looks at him] This looks pretty stupid."
2475,18,10,Dad and Mom,"What the heck? [tries to turn the TV off, but it won't turn off]"
2476,18,10,Eric Cartman,CartmaanBrah!
2477,18,10,Dad and Mom,[smacks the remote on his left hand a few times] This damn TV! What is that window doing outside the holiday special?! [tries turning the TV off again]
2478,18,10,Dad and Mom,Call customer service.
2479,18,10,Steve from Customer Service,Panasonic customer service. How can I help you?
2480,18,10,Dad and Mom,"Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that?"
2481,18,10,Steve from Customer Service,Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?
2482,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!"
2483,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,This isn't part of the holiday special! What is he doing?!
2484,18,10,Controller 2,He's trending more than we ever thought possible.!
2485,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful."
2486,18,10,Det Harris,"[laughing with them] Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead."
2487,18,10,Peterson,"So, then, the first black guy said to the second black guy, ""Don't shoot me. I'm on your side."""
2488,18,10,Det Harris,"Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on. [catches his breath] Okay, go ahead."
2489,18,10,Peterson,"And then the, the the tattooed black guy said, to him, ""I ain't gonna kill you, man. You're the King of Pop. Let's go cap that whitey producer."""
2490,18,10,Det Harris,Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!
2491,18,10,Eric Cartman,"[his commenter window appears] Happy holidays, everyone! [the cops stop laughing and look at the window] Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah."
2492,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"Damn it, you're ruining the show!"
2493,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah."
2494,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,I am so confused.
2495,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,[to Ron] Shut him down!'
2496,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"We can't, sir!"
2497,18,10,Eric Cartman,"I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool."
2498,18,10,Stephen Stotch,I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?
2499,18,10,Eric Cartman,"It's all CartmanBrah now. [a shot of Times Square. Cartman's image replaces everything else on the screens there] I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender. [a shot of the Times Square crowd, looking at the screens in disbelief] Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!"
2500,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,"This is not what I hired you for! I CONTROL TALENT, DAMNIT!"
2501,18,10,MJ s hologram,[bursts through the doors with Tupac's hologram] There he is! That's the ignorant man!
2502,18,10,Record Producer and Ron,This is crazy and everyone is watching everything!
2503,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinking aloud] Everyone is watching everything. [turns right and walks up to a camera] Ike? [switch to Ike's room] Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa. [Ike's friends look at the monitor] I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did. [Michael's hologram walks up to the record producer and shoots him in the head, killing him] I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again."
2504,18,10,Kid 4,"Oh, I feel bad for the little guy."
2505,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner",There's nothing sadder than a old man crying.
2506,18,10,Kid 3,Maybe we should help
2507,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner",Yeah!
2508,18,10,Kid 2,Okay.
2509,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Help? How can you help?
2510,18,10,Kid 2,It's the holiday season. We just need to get everyone to believe again.
2511,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner","Yeah, someone can come change all this. You know who."
2512,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,Really? That's what you guys would do?
2513,18,10,"Ike and his friends, including Conner",Of course! We just need to get everyone to believe in him. He'll always come and help. #webelieveinyou
2514,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!"
2515,18,10,MJ s hologram,We believe in you. Of course!
2516,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,[walks ever closer to the camera] You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! [the signal is now disrupted]
2517,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey! What's going on? What is that? [amid some special effects of snow and holly popping out of the upper right corner of screens everywhere, PewDiePie's commenter window appears]"
2518,18,10,PewDiePie,How's it goin' bros? This is [goes fullscreen]PewDiePie!
2519,18,10,Eric Cartman,What the hell?!
2520,18,10,Kids,PewDiePie!
2521,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,PewDiePie?!
2522,18,10,PewDiePie,"Thanks for all the shoutouts. I guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out."
2523,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!"
2524,18,10,PewDiePie,"[mocking Cartman] God damn it, get out of here!"
2525,18,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!"
2526,18,10,PewDiePie,"This show is getting kind of boring, bros. What do you say we change it out to something more exciting?"
2527,18,10,Eric Cartman,Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
2528,18,10,PewDiePie,I know! Let's play Call of Duty! [the game pops up fullscreen and the commenter windows switch places]
2529,18,10,Eric Cartman,No! You can't do this!
2530,18,10,PewDiePie,"Ohhh yeah! This is more like it, bros!"
2531,18,10,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!"
2532,18,10,PewDiePie,"Okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. Let's get rid of him!"
2533,18,10,Eric Cartman,"NOOOO! [his commenter window disappears, as well as the holiday special]"
2534,18,10,PewDiePie,"Oh yeah! Way better, bros! This is how we do it in Sweden! BOOM head shot! BOOM head shot!"
2535,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night."
2536,18,10,Stan Marsh,"I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about."
2537,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats."
2538,18,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2539,18,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here. [notices PewDiePie's commenter window pop up to his right and above] And I, think that's great."
2540,18,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I think that's great too."
2541,18,10,PewDiePie,"Alright bros, it look like we'll have to end it there. I wanna thank South Park for being in my show. I hope you bros enjoyed watching, and as always, stay awesome!"
