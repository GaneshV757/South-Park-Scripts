0,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops so he doesn't get hurt and glares] Stop it, Cartman!"
1,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Pfaha, so funny. [pulls out another firecracker, tosses it before Kyle, and cackles]"
2,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops] Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! [Cartman cackles some more. The boys approach a booth: Roger's Edge]"
3,8,1,Roger,"Come on and take a look, folks. We've got a lot of knives for sale here. [Stan stops before a table, ""Weapons of Asia,"" and marvels at the weapons displayed there.]"
4,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, look! [the other boys turn and walk up] Martial arts weapons from the Far East. [the sign reads ""Martial arts weapons of the Far East""]"
5,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[softly] Wow, cool."
6,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas."
7,8,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
8,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away] Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. [the others turn as well]"
9,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!"
10,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought. [the boys turn back to face the table] I'll get the tonfas. [they look like the nightsticks police use, but made of wood] Those are so sweet."
11,8,1,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna get those killer sai. [swords with horns at the hilt are in there. Cartman notices a weapon off to the right] Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken [ninja star] for a dollar ninety nine.
12,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(Shuriken. Awesome!)
13,8,1,Roger,[approaches] Can I help you boys? [the boys step back from the table to see him.]
14,8,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
15,8,1,Roger,"Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission. [the boys look at each other]"
16,8,1,Eric Cartman,Parents? Parents?! [fakes a sob] Oh God! [starts sobbing loudly and turns away.]
17,8,1,Roger,Wha- wha- what's the matter? [Cartman continues sobbing]
18,8,1,Stan Marsh,"We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year."
19,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Why?! [Stan cries, then covers his eyes. Cartman turns around, still sobbing] Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?! [Kenny begins to sob] Why?! [Kyle observes his friends, then joins them in the sobbing]"
20,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
21,8,1,Roger,"[tries to soothe them] It's all right, it's all right boys. Don't cry, I'll... I'll just... go pack these up for you, okay? [takes a few weapons and leaves. The boys cry a bit more, then stop]"
22,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked."
23,8,1,Stan Marsh,[with his tonfa] Kiya! Kiya!
24,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Kaii yo! [one end of his nunchaku hits his hat a few times]
25,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you! [lunges] Iya!"
26,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[sweeps one of his tonfa around and transforms] With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like."
27,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku [he transforms], a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble."
28,8,1,Stan Marsh,"What's your ninja name, Kenny?"
29,8,1,Kenny McCormick,[already transformed] (unintelligible)
30,8,1,Eric Cartman,[already transformed] Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies.
31,8,1,Stan Marsh,"All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!"
32,8,1,Eric Cartman,Kick ass! [the boys head out]
33,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous."
34,8,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)"
35,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[cautions] No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them."
36,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!"
37,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[the background is a motion blur] You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!"
38,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true."
39,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go. [they walk off and approach Craig's house, which is done up in Japanese style. Stan stops and whispers] All right, this is it."
40,8,1,Eric Cartman,Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. [the boys approach quickly]
41,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,I still say this is a bad idea.
42,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Ninja positions! [the boys get into their first positions and Craig opens the door] Hello, Craig!"
43,8,1,Eric Cartman,[shows off his sai] Look what we got.
44,8,1,Craig Tucker,Where'd you get those?
45,8,1,Stan Marsh,We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
46,8,1,Eric Cartman,"[moves past Stan] Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy."
47,8,1,Craig Tucker,"Uh-uh, they're not that cool."
48,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Hyeah, ""they're not that cool."" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East."
49,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,But don't tell anybody we have them.
50,8,1,Eric Cartman,Ugh.
51,8,1,Token Black,"[appears with Clyde, behind Craig] Whoa! Where'd you get those?!"
52,8,1,Clyde Donovan,Let me see.
53,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. [turns and walks away]"
54,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril. [he and the other two turn and walk away as well] Come on, ninjas!"
55,8,1,All,Ho! [they trot off. Craig closes the door]
56,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!"
57,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! [Butters shows up before them]"
58,8,1,Butters Stotch,Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
59,8,1,Eric Cartman,"We're playing Ninjas, Butters."
60,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?"
61,8,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us."
62,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys. [the boys turn and walk off] We have a lot of work to do."
63,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Yes, and no time to do it. No time... [Butters stands in the open alone]"
64,8,1,Butters Stotch,"I think I'd make a really good ninja. [turns right and walks off towards home, rejected] Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. [opens the front door and enters]"
65,8,1,Butters Stotch,I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
66,8,1,Linda Stotch,Hi Butters.
67,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Hi Mom. [walks upstairs] -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude. [enters his room and heads for the closet] And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil. [enters the closet] Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time! [one swoosh of his cape and he transforms] Professor Chaos! [he holds his hands some distance apart and a ball of energy appears. This electrifies his whole body] Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! [cackles. Now transformed, he makes his way downstairs. The stairs crack under his weight. He smashes his left fist into the wall, leaving a small crater in it. His mom looks on from the couch]"
68,8,1,Linda Stotch,"Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?"
69,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[in a gravelly voice] Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while."
70,8,1,Linda Stotch,"Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week."
71,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, o- okay Mom. [sees the pie on the small end table by the foot of the stairs and carries it off] Bah! Gah! [in his mind, he's big and powerful. Every step he takes affects the house. The first dislodges the family portrait, the second dislodges it more, the third knocks it to the ground. He opens the front door, goes out and slams it shot, knocking it off its hinges]"
72,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction."
73,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next."
74,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it."
75,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!"
76,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!"
77,8,1,Eric Cartman,I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
78,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
79,8,1,Eric Cartman,I have the power to have all the powers I want.
80,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"That doesn't count, fatass!"
81,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!"
82,8,1,Eric Cartman,[protests] C'mon!
83,8,1,Butters Stotch,Haaa ha ha ha ha! [he appears with energy bristling all around him] Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
84,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Who the hell is that?
85,8,1,Stan Marsh,"I dunno. Craig, is that you?"
86,8,1,Butters Stotch,[strikes a ground pose] Fools! [jumps into the air and more energy surges from him. A fireball appears between his hands] I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom! [closeup] Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
87,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa.
88,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys."
89,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
90,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[steps forth] Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa! [Stan strikes a battle pose and unleashes the energy from the tonfa tips. Butters shields himself with his cape, and the tonfa energy dissipates. Butters cackles] Hey kid, that knocks you down."
91,8,1,Butters Stotch,Nuh uh!
92,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, huh, I got you!"
93,8,1,Butters Stotch,Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
94,8,1,Eric Cartman,That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
95,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! [whips them around a few times and unleashes an icy stream of energy towards Butters. The blasts knock Butters out of the air and he hits the ground with a thud.]"
96,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding! [leaps up into the air and jumps back down, strikes the ground with his right fist, and the ground cracks towards the boys, ending with them being tossed into the air. The boys land on the ground again and look up at Butters] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! [two spiderwebs drop down and trap Stan and Kyle]"
97,8,1,Eric Cartman,"All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay! [Cartman attempts to unleash energy with his hands, but nothing happens.] Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!"
98,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, okay, you can have your powers back."
99,8,1,Eric Cartman,All right! And now I will use my power to... [faces the other boys] turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! [in an instant Kyle becomes a chicken]
100,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,God dammit Cartman!
101,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!"
102,8,1,Butters Stotch,Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
103,8,1,Stan Marsh,Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
104,8,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!) [shows off an eight-pointed shuriken] (Feel my wrath!) [unleashes the shuriken, and it strikes Butters in the eye. Butters' helmet flies off, revealing his puff-ball hair and the shuriken embedded in the bloody left eye. The music abruptly stops and the boys are shown in regular form. Butters looks at the boys and sobs loudly]"
105,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, shit, dude!"
106,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[he and Kyle rush over to Butters] Butters! Oh my God! [the boys gather around Butters] Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!"
107,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!"
108,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
109,8,1,Butters Stotch,It hurts! It hurts! [continues to sob]
110,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
111,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[tries to soothe Butters] Shhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really."
112,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[trying to catch his breath] But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! [Butters continues to shriek in agonizing pain while Stan looks around nervously, with gritted teeth]"
113,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! [Butters composes himself and sobs softly, looking around from time to time for any sign of help]"
114,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Guys, meeting over here for a second? [the boys move off and huddle] All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard."
115,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, shut up!"
116,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,I agree with Cartman!
117,8,1,Stan Marsh,What?!
118,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
119,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Just stay still, Butters."
120,8,1,Butters Stotch,[Stan tugs again] Ah. [Stan tugs harder] Hwa! [Stan tugs even harder] Hwaaaaa!
121,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
122,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us."
123,8,1,Butters Stotch,You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! [whimpers]
124,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened."
125,8,1,Stan Marsh,God dammit!
126,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[moves off] God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again."
127,8,1,Eric Cartman,"[approaches] Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle. [to the huddle] Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character."
128,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, I'm getting woozy."
129,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Butters. [to the other boys] Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. [puts his fingertips to his temples. Kenny touches his right temple, Stan, his chin]"
130,8,1,Stan Marsh,"We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?"
131,8,1,Eric Cartman,Dr. Shafley?
132,8,1,Stan Marsh,He's really old and going blind.
133,8,1,Eric Cartman,So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
134,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no.
135,8,1,Stan Marsh,We might pass him off as our pet.
136,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[sniffling] But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded."
137,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Butters!"
138,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, Butters!"
139,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Butters!"
140,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!"
141,8,1,Stan Marsh,"All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened."
142,8,1,Eric Cartman,Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. [Kyle hands him the glue]
143,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[between whimpers] Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy."
144,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!"
145,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We need some more fur. [Stan walks over to Sparky and shaves off fur from areas of his body still unshaved, then walks back to Kyle and hands him the fur. Kyle places the fur on Butters' left leg] I think that's good."
146,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters."
147,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff."
148,8,1,Stan Marsh,All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
149,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[looks off to his left] Okay, it's clear. [turns right and walks on. Cartman and Kyle escort Butters between them]"
150,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot."
151,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[practices his bark unprompted] Wuhuff, woof, woof."
152,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! [some trash bin noises are heard and the boys face the source of the noises]"
153,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh shit, somebody's coming!"
154,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Quick, hide Butters! [Cartman drags Butters to an oven]"
155,8,1,Eric Cartman,In here! [opens its door and shoves Butters in]
156,8,1,Butters Stotch,"bu- but fellas, I gotta- [Cartman closes the door. Craig and his boys appear]"
157,8,1,Craig Tucker,"Aha! [the three remaining boys quickly face Craig's crew] There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! [Craig and his boys present their weapons]"
158,8,1,Eric Cartman,"No way, you got weapons too?!"
159,8,1,Stan Marsh,Where'd you get those?
160,8,1,Jimmy Valmer,"From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-"
161,8,1,Clyde Donovan,From the nice guy at the county fair.
162,8,1,Craig Tucker,"At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead."
163,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon!"
164,8,1,Craig Tucker,"So, [unsheathes his sword] how would you ninjas like to do battle?"
165,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, not now, Craig, we have to be going."
166,8,1,Craig Tucker,You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! [Clyde crosses his kamas against each other]
167,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"He said, not now, Craig!"
168,8,1,Craig Tucker,"I am not Craig, [twirls his sword] I am Ginza, [transforms] with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!"
169,8,1,Token Black,"And I am Black Chaku, [twirls his nunchakus and transforms] with the power of perfect spelling!"
170,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Guys, we're really not playing, okay? [Jimmy has already transformed and leaps into the air, twirling his kali sticks around, and lands in a powerful pose]"
171,8,1,Jimmy Valmer,"Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?"
172,8,1,Eric Cartman,[the boys are back in anime form] We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
173,8,1,Clyde Donovan,Then fight us!
174,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!"
175,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,I swore to never fight again.
176,8,1,Stan Marsh,"We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! [He begins his attack. The other boys move forth and the fight begins, as a song reminiscent of Japanese anime theme songs, mostly Japanese with occasional English words, starts playing; its lyrics appear as a sing-along along the bottom of the screen.]"
177,8,1,Singer,"Subarashii chinchin mono
Kintama no kame aru
Sore no oto ha ""saru bobo"" Iie!
Ninja ga imasu
Hey Hey Let's Go! kenka suru
Taisetsu no mono protect my balls
Boku ga warui so let's fighting 
Let's fighting love...Let's fighting love... Kono uta chotto baka
Wake ga wakaranai
Eigo ga mechakucha
Daijobu?  We do it all the time!
Hey hey let's go  kenka suru..."
178,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait! [the song ends, and he looks around] Wait. [steps forward] Hold on a second. Where's Butters? [sees the open oven door, and no one in the oven]"
179,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no. Butters!
180,8,1,Eric Cartman,Butters!
181,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[turns and faces Craig's boys] Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!"
182,8,1,Craig Tucker,Lose who?
183,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Craig] Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!"
184,8,1,Craig Tucker,Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
185,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!"
186,8,1,Craig Tucker,"Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!"
187,8,1,Stan Marsh,"No dude, you gotta help us find him!"
188,8,1,Craig Tucker,To hell with that!
189,8,1,Eric Cartman,"We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!"
190,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Hello? Anybody-eh. [the driver appears again and slows down to observe Butters. His right eyebrow rises] Woof. Woof. Woofwoof. [his voice softens] Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. [the drives speeds up and drives off. Butters turns and continues his lonely walk. Back near Skid Row the eight boys walk along searching for Butters.]"
191,8,1,Stan Marsh,Butters!
192,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Butters!
193,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Here, Butters!"
194,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(Butters!)
195,8,1,Craig Tucker,Butters!
196,8,1,Clyde Donovan,Butters!
197,8,1,Token Black,Butters!
198,8,1,Jimmy Valmer,Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
199,8,1,Eric Cartman,Butter- Butters!
200,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Butters!
201,8,1,Stan Marsh,Butters!
202,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look! [a black man walks up in anime form, stops, and looks around]"
203,8,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
204,8,1,The Boys,"Hey, Chef."
205,8,1,Chef,How's it goin'?
206,8,1,Stan Marsh,Bad.
207,8,1,Chef,Why bad?
208,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?"
209,8,1,Chef,"No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?"
210,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Nothing, just... playing."
211,8,1,Chef,"Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out."
212,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we know."
213,8,1,Chef,"Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! [turns and walks away]"
214,8,1,Nurse,[behind the counter] Oh my God! [leaves her station and kneels down next to Butters] What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?!
215,8,1,Dr Doctor,[approaches and kneels down next to Butters] Jesus Christ. [Butters shakes his head and babbles] What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.
216,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[moans, then opens his eyes] Woof woof."
217,8,1,Nurse,"Can you help him, Doctor?"
218,8,1,Dr Doctor,"I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter."
219,8,1,Nurse,[rises and leaves] Right away.
220,8,1,Announcer,"[with recaps from the episode] In our last episode the four ninjas did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom. It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons, if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped, and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded."
221,8,1,Stan Marsh,Butters!
222,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Butters!
223,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Here, Butters!"
224,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(Butters!)
225,8,1,Craig Tucker,Butters!
226,8,1,Clyde Donovan,Butters!
227,8,1,Token Black,Butters!
228,8,1,Craig Tucker,Butters! Where the hell are you?!
229,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! [moves off]"
230,8,1,Stan Marsh,What?
231,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[reaches a well and holds his nunchucks over it] Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything."
232,8,1,Eric Cartman,"[with his sais] Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!"
233,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back."
234,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!"
235,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try."
236,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Screw you, fatass! [struggles to loosen his grip on the nunchucks]"
237,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true. [Kyle continues struggling and begins to grunt] Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle. [closeup of Cartman's lips] Do it. [Kyle struggles even harder, but eventually gives in]"
238,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up next to Stan] I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
239,8,1,Stan Marsh,"It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them."
240,8,1,Vet,"Come on. Come on, little fella. 'Atta boy. [Butters appears at the other end of the leash, crawling in]"
241,8,1,Butters Stotch,[in a gravelly voice] Woof woof. [babbles incoherently. The veterinarian leads him towards a cell]
242,8,1,Vet,"Right over here. [opens the gate] Good dog. Come on. [guides Butters in] There you go, right in there. [closes the gate and locks it, then leaves] Goooood dog. [Butters babbles some more as a dog approaches from his left and sniffs. The dog pisses on him and walks away. Butters' voice rises in protest. Another dog approaches from his right, sniffs him, and pisses on him. Butters' voice rises a bit more in protest. A third dog approaches from his left, turns around, and craps on him. Butters stands up]"
243,8,1,Butters Stotch,Gaaaah!
244,8,1,Assistant,Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?
245,8,1,Vet,"It just makes me sick how some people can treat animals. [pulls out a large syringe, quickly] Well, nothing we can do for it; let's put it to sleep, shall we? [they move back into Butters' cell] Here you go, pup. I've got a sweet dose of murder for you. What the? Blasted! He's escaped! ...Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs."
246,8,1,Stan Marsh,"All right, the county fair's still open! [they spot Roger, shown in anime form, and approach his booth.]"
247,8,1,Roger,Can I help you boys?
248,8,1,Stan Marsh,We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
249,8,1,Roger,"Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds."
250,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Listen, douche! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!"
251,8,1,Roger,I thought you told me your parents were dead.
252,8,1,Craig Tucker,[approaches with his boys] You guys! [the other boys turn around] You guys!
253,8,1,Stan Marsh,"What is it, Craig?"
254,8,1,Craig Tucker,It's Butters! We saw him!
255,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Where?!
256,8,1,Craig Tucker,Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
257,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Then it's not too late!
258,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Ninjas! [the boys make their way across the fairgrounds, but freeze in their tracks upon seeing the auction]"
259,8,1,Barker,"[in anime form] All right, folks, our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp."
260,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there."
261,8,1,Craig Tucker,Butters is right on the other side.
262,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,We have to get past them!
263,8,1,Eric Cartman,All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
264,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,You have that power too?
265,8,1,Eric Cartman,"I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold. [steps aside and holds his arms up. He sweeps them down and disappears. He them removes his clothes and gathers them into a pile] This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. [walks over to Stan and hands his clothes over] Here, hold this stuff for me."
266,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Good luck, Bulrog. [Cartman leaves, with only his footsteps indicating where he's going]"
267,8,1,Barker,"Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming. [Cartman, in normal form, appears, tip-toeing across the stage sideways. His penis can be seen.] It has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base. This is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique. [Cartman changes his gait and tip-toes forward. The bidders look on] The lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars."
268,8,1,Barker,"[Cartman changes his gait and tip-toes along sideways. One of the staffers notices Cartman and taps his colleague. The colleague looks and gasps] So we're gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five. Do I, do I hear three hundred and seventy five? [Cartman continues tip-toeing along and the bidders sit motionless. Eight seconds pass before Cartman stops, realizing that the crowd can indeed see him.] Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'? [Cartman looks around, knowing he's stuck.]"
269,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[wanders on stage] Haba, haba! Habahoaha! [babbles some more, then falls flat on his back again]"
270,8,1,Linda Stotch,[rises with her hands on her chest] Butters! [the auction staff encircles the boy]
271,8,1,Randy Marsh,What happened to him?
272,8,1,Sheila Broflovski,Oh my God!
273,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, Jesus."
274,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh dude, we are gonna get it now."
275,8,1,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened. [the boys' parents are present, with angry faces on] But let's try to speak one at a time."
276,8,1,Man 1,"Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!"
277,8,1,Townsfolk,[amid chatter] Yeah! I agree!
278,8,1,Gerald Brofloski,This is the worst thing that's happened in this town! [Butters is shown with a patch over his left eye and a long gauze wrapped around his head to keep the patch in place] The worst thing!
279,8,1,Man 2,"Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage! [the adults go into an uproar again]"
280,8,1,Stan Marsh,What?
281,8,1,Eric Cartman,What?
282,8,1,Skeeter,"Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!"
283,8,1,Sheila Broflovski,This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! [the adults go into an uproar again]
284,8,1,Mr Garrison,"[next to Mr. Mackey] You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!"
285,8,1,Eric Cartman,I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. [the adults go into an uproar again]
286,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?"
287,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Just run with it, dude."
288,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks around, then stands on his chair] Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. Cartman should be punished!"
289,8,1,Man,Yeah! [the adults go into an uproar again]
290,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, fuck you, Kyle!"
291,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I c- I can't believe it."
292,8,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
293,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,[pulls out his nunchucks] So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
294,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[he and Kenny pull out their weapons] Yeah. Come on, ninjas. [they transform into their anime forms] We've got some more work to do."
295,8,1,The Boys,"[leap into a pose, and the image is frozen] Hya!"
296,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Hey fellas.
297,8,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy."
298,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmy!
299,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[carries a brochure under his right arm] Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver."
300,8,2,Eric Cartman,[approaches Jimmy] The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
301,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
302,8,2,Eric Cartman,[snickers] What?
303,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,[hands Cartman the brochure] Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
304,8,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on."
305,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that'd be cool."
306,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year."
307,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys."
308,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmy! [he and Jimmy walk off.]
309,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement."
310,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"...You're an asshole, Cartman."
311,8,2,Eric Cartman,What? What'd I do?
312,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,S-s-six!
313,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah.
314,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,S-s-s-ssseven!
315,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah. Timmah!
316,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,S-s-seven!
317,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah! Timmah!
318,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[gets back on count, but falters] Ni- I can- I can't! [Timmy helps Jimmy put the weights back on the bar rest] Huff. Oh man. [sits up] Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year. [another kid at a nearby bench press laughs] All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven reps. Oh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room."
319,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah. [Jimmy walks away]
320,8,2,Francis,"Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday."
321,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[turns and looks] You too, Francis. [looks forward and resumes walking. In a darkened hallway stands a big athlete with an air of hauteur about him]"
322,8,2,Nathan,Hey Jimmy.
323,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh he-hey, N-Nathan."
324,8,2,Nathan,"So uh, I see you train pretty hard."
325,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[moves into the hallway and faces Nathan] Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away."
326,8,2,Nathan,"Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts."
327,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,What kind of shortcuts?
328,8,2,Nathan,You know. Steroids.
329,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,S-s-ss-s-s-steroids? [Nathan signals him to be quite as another handicapped athlete walks by] ...But aren't those illegal?
330,8,2,Nathan,"Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests."
331,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?"
332,8,2,Nathan,[holds out a prescription bottle] You just take one of these little blue babies [holds up three fingers] three times a day [reaches into a fanny pack and pulls out a syringe] and inject this directly into your bloodstream [holds up two fingers] twice a day before meals.
333,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,How much would this cost me?
334,8,2,Nathan,"Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas."
335,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[looks around uneasily] Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a performance."
336,8,2,Nathan,"Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend. [steps closer] Whatever you say. [Jimmy reaches out for the drugs]"
337,8,2,Eric Cartman,[rushes up with the brochure] You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
338,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,What?
339,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" [he looks at his friends as his jaw drops]"
340,8,2,Stan Marsh,So?
341,8,2,Eric Cartman,"So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!"
342,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no. Cartman, no!"
343,8,2,Eric Cartman,"It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!"
344,8,2,Stan Marsh,"That's really, really terrible, dude."
345,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. [walks off]"
346,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,[moves and catches up to Cartman] Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
347,8,2,Eric Cartman,Why?
348,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,Because! [takes away the brochure]
349,8,2,Eric Cartman,"What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?! [points an accusing finger at him] Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale! [lowers it] Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle! [turns around and walks off. Kyle seethes in silence. Cartman now talks to himself] All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is."
350,8,2,Eric Cartman,Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics. [loosens the chin straps and lowers his face to normal] Bull's eye!
351,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second! [heads for his duffel bag and hauls it to his night stand. The knock is heard again]
352,8,2,Dad,Jimmy?
353,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[sweeps the steroids into the bag] Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming. [rushes to the closet and shoves the duffle bag in.]"
354,8,2,Dad,"Jim, it's your father!"
355,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,[walking towards the door] I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second! [realizes he still has the syringe in his mouth] Hold it. [and spits it out. He opens the door and sees his father with a cup of coffee.]
356,8,2,Dad,"Jimmy, were you masturbating?"
357,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"N-no, Dad."
358,8,2,Dad,"Okay. Well, you have a visitor. [the camera pans down to a pretty girl, who enters the room]"
359,8,2,Girl,Hi Jimmy.
360,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy."
361,8,2,Nancy,I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.
362,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.
363,8,2,Dad,"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim."
364,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week."
365,8,2,Dad,"I'll leave you two alone. [reaches for the door, but stops] Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were."
366,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Dad, Jesus C-Christ!"
367,8,2,Dad,"Okay, then. [they look at each other]"
368,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey. [the boys stop and look] Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr."
369,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,[low voice] God damn you!
370,8,2,Eric Cartman,"You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away. [This means it's Tuesday prior] I'm going to go sign up now."
371,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No you're not! [whips out the brochure] I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics."
372,8,2,Eric Cartman,What?! [takes the brochure back from Kyle]
373,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! [grins confidently. Cartman looks at him, then at the brochure and reads]"
374,8,2,Eric Cartman,Moooommmm?
375,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Yes, hon? [begins writing a check]"
376,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Um, could I get you to do something for me?"
377,8,2,Liane Cartman,"What's that, hon?"
378,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? [Liane looks up and goes pale]"
379,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... ""special"" children."
380,8,2,Eric Cartman,I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
381,8,2,Liane Cartman,"You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. [writes out another check]"
382,8,2,Eric Cartman,...I'll split the money with you. [Liane stops]
383,8,2,Liane Cartman,"...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. [Cartman is upset and begins to think a little harder]"
384,8,2,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to the table] All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth. [under his breath] God, this is gonna be hard to say. [normally] I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change. [looks up at her with longing] Help me change?"
385,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow."
386,8,2,Eric Cartman,Awesome.
387,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving."
388,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah!
389,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?"
390,8,2,Timmy Burch,"[slips on his sweater] Timmah! [reaches over for the bag and grabs a handle. The contents spill out, since he didn't grab the other handle, and he sees the steroids drop to the floor. He looks down sadly and holds the bag a litle closer. Jimmy is frozen in place. Timmy's voice shakes] Tim- Timmy?"
391,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later? [sweeps the steroids back into the bag. Timmy finds a bottle on his pants and looks at it. Jimmy finishes up and leaves] I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim."
392,8,2,Timmy Burch,[turns and exclaims] Timmah... [the tone of voice stops Jimmy]
393,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[turns] Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!"
394,8,2,Timmy Burch,[rolls up to Jimmy] Timmah. Timmah!
395,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!"
396,8,2,Timmy Burch,[turns aside and sighs] Timmah. [rolls away a bit] T-T-Timmah.
397,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?"
398,8,2,Timmy Burch,Huh! Timmah! T-Timmah!
399,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!"
400,8,2,Timmy Burch,"Timmah! Timmah, Jimmih! [points to himself] Arrrh Timmah! [points to himself] Jimmih!"
401,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
402,8,2,Timmy Burch,[spent] Huh... Timmah... [holds the bottle out over the floor] Timmah.
403,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[angered] S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?! [Timmy drops the bottle on the ground, turns around and rolls away. Jimmy watches him leave] Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world! [looks down at the bottle, then kicks the bottle away with his left crutch] Fuck!"
404,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah! [rolls forward and throws the javelin] Aaar-yaaaaah Timmah! [the javelin hits the ground near a coach]
405,8,2,Coach,"All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up!"
406,8,2,Timmy Burch,Oowrrr! Timmah! Livilaye!
407,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,[runs down a track for the long jump] Y-yeess! [jumps into the air and lands]Grrrr!
408,8,2,Coach 2,"Wuh-wow, Jimmy, I can't believe how much you've improved! You're bigger and stronger than I've ever seen you!"
409,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard."
410,8,2,Coach 2,You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday!
411,8,2,Man,"Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?"
412,8,2,Volunteer,Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized.
413,8,2,Woman,Thank you very much.
414,8,2,Volunteer,"Thank you! Good luck, Michael."
415,8,2,Michael,Thanks.
416,8,2,Volunteer,"Okay, next in line please?"
417,8,2,Eric Cartman,"[looking really retarded, steps up to the table with his mom] Naaaa! Daaaaa!"
418,8,2,Volunteer,Hello there.
419,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please."
420,8,2,Eric Cartman,Naaaa!
421,8,2,Volunteer,"Oh, great! What's his name?"
422,8,2,Liane Cartman,Eric Cartman...
423,8,2,Eric Cartman,Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
424,8,2,Volunteer,Okay. Age?
425,8,2,Liane Cartman,He's nine.
426,8,2,Volunteer,"O-kay, and what's his disability?"
427,8,2,Liane Cartman,"...Um, he's retarded. [Cartman offers a retarded grin]"
428,8,2,Volunteer,"...N-no, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy?"
429,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure. [Cartman looks up with some concern] Sweetie, what is your condition?"
430,8,2,Eric Cartman,...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
431,8,2,Volunteer,I'll just leave that blank for now.
432,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[performs the injection] Yeah, b-bigger, stronger! [Timmy rolls by and hears him, then raises his eyes in alarm]"
433,8,2,Mr Mackey,"[opens the door] Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in. [Timmy follows Mr. Mackey in] I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay?"
434,8,2,Timmy Burch,[leans forward and begins] Timmy.
435,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it."
436,8,2,Timmy Burch,[sighs and begins again] Timmy.
437,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem?"
438,8,2,Timmy Burch,"[shakes his head vigorously] No Timmy, Jimmy."
439,8,2,Mr Mackey,Ji-Jimmy?
440,8,2,Timmy Burch,"[showing his frustration] Haaa! [remembers something] Oh, oh! [wheels over to a class picture of the fourth graders. Jimmy is at one end of the front row, with Mr. Garrison behind him. Timmy reaches up and points] Jimmy."
441,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?"
442,8,2,Timmy Burch,"[rolls back and tries to get the story out with gestures. He demonstrates Jimmy asking for his bag] Timmah! Timmah, uh, Jimmih. [demonstrates himself handing the bag to Jimmy and seeing the contents fall out] Hey Timmy, Timmah Tim-oh! Tim-Timmah! [shows his reaction to the steroids] Timmmah? Jimmih! Jimmih. [demonstrates the argument between the two] Jimmih Timmah Timmah? Timmah, Timmah! Jimmih... Jimmih! Jimmih! Timmah! [demonstrates the bottle being dropped] Timmah!"
443,8,2,Mr Mackey,"[confused] Mmmmm'kaaay. I don't quite follow, Timmy."
444,8,2,Timmy Burch,Argh. Jimmy...
445,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Right, Jimmy Valmer."
446,8,2,Timmy Burch,"Uh. [demonstrates himself minding his own business when he sees Jimmy shooting up in the shadows], Timmah Jimmih Jimmih Jim- [demonstrates the injection, then flexes his muscles and takes a sinister tone] Jimmh Timmah Timmah Jimmih!"
447,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Right. He's Jimmy, yeah."
448,8,2,Timmy Burch,[really frustrated] Haaaaaaaaaah!
449,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Enter. [Kyle enters, and walks up next to Cartman]"
450,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. [they look at each other and Cartman closes a book he had open for reference]"
451,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Go on, Kyle."
452,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!"
453,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew."
454,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!"
455,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul."
456,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,I came here to talk about you!
457,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Yes. [hops off his seat and consoles Kyle] And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle. [whispers] Good luck. [after a few seconds, Kyle turns around and goes to leave. He opens the door, turns around to say something but instead walks out. Cartman just hums a tune, goes back to the computer and reads some more.]"
458,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Come on, push it! Push it! [he pushes the weights onto the bar rest and sits up. He checks his musculature out in the mirror] Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. [the door opens and Nancy enters]"
459,8,2,Nancy,"Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop."
460,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time."
461,8,2,Nancy,I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time.
462,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Oh Jesus! [lays back down and takes up the weights] You gonna start running your mouth off again? [begins new reps] P-push it! Push it!
463,8,2,Nancy,"Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different."
464,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,They-they're all just... jealous.
465,8,2,Nancy,You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you.
466,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[quickly rests the weights and sits up] You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!"
467,8,2,Nancy,You can't treat people like this!
468,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[gets up and walks over to Nancy, then begins beating her with his crutches. She wails] I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?! [he grabs her by the throat and throws her head against the floor a few times, then whacks her on the side of the head a few times.] You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told! [resumes beating her. His mom opens the door to see what's the matter]"
469,8,2,Sarah Valmer,"What the? [tries to stop the beating] Jimmy, oh my God!"
470,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[throws his mother off and heads for the door] Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches! [walks down the hall, hits the walk with his right crutch, and breaks down.] No! God! [collapses on his back and bawls]"
471,8,2,Host,"Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special Olympics! [the crowd cheers. The boys are there, as promised] We will be holding various throughout the day, and at the end of it all we will have some very special celebrity athletes here to present the trophy for top athlete, along with the cash prize of one thousand dollars."
472,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[flexes his right bicep] Top athlete, yeah!"
473,8,2,Eric Cartman,"One thousand dollars, yeah!"
474,8,2,Host,So let's have all our athletes report to their first assigned events and... Let the Games begin! [The crowd cheers wildly]
475,8,2,Announcer,Will those athletes in heat 1 of the hundred-meter dash please report to Track Area B.
476,8,2,Volunteer 2,"Okay, racers, are we ready? [raises her firing pistol] Take your marks."
477,8,2,Eric Cartman,[hobbles into the fifth position on the track] Daaaa! Daaaa!
478,8,2,Volunteer 2,On your marks! Get set! Go! [the runners take off. Cartman quickly falls behind]
479,8,2,Eric Cartman,Whoa. What the hell?? [the girl in position 6 breaks the tape. Cartman hobbles past the finish line four seconds later]
480,8,2,Volunteer 2,"Great job, everyone. [points to the runners who were in positions 6, 2, and 4] You three advance to the next heat. [the group leaves]"
481,8,2,Winner,All right!
482,8,2,Blond Boy,Good Job.
483,8,2,Blonde Girl,We did it!
484,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events."
485,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Yeeessss! [walks back and forth happily] Yes! Yes!
486,8,2,Announcer,"He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics record, folks! [Timmy is understandably unimpressed and pissed off]"
487,8,2,Eric Cartman,[trips over a hurdle] God-damnit!
488,8,2,Announcer,"Winner, Jimmy Valmer! [Jimmy flexes his left arm and scrambles out of the water. Timmy is more pissed off]"
489,8,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, this one I can win! [drops his pole, takes off his helmet and gives it to another athlete] Here, hold this! [takes up his pole and aims] I'll show you Goddamned retards! [runs up to the posts, plants his pole, and sails up, but the pole won't straighten out. It flexes a few time before it breaks, sending Cartman back down to the track, where he lands on his back]"
490,8,2,Eric Cartman,God-damnit!
491,8,2,Announcer,That's another Special Olympics record!
492,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[raises his arms and crutches up in victory] Yeah! Yeah! [turns around] Yeah, I did it! [turns around] Yeah! Yeah!"
493,8,2,Host,"Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end, and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004! Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds. [the three players come out and walk to the podium. All of them are buff]"
494,8,2,Barry Bonds,The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer.
495,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[raises up his left arm and crutch] Yeah! Fuck yeah! [Timmy sits nearby with his arms crossed, glaring at Jimmy. Jimmy walks up to the podium] Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best! [Bonds hands Jimmy the medal. The host returns to the podium]"
496,8,2,Host,"Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!"
497,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Ah, screw you hippies!"
498,8,2,Host,"For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!"
499,8,2,Eric Cartman,"...I could pile at Shakey's, heck. [puts on his helmet and walks up] Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!"
500,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[confronts Cartman] Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?!"
501,8,2,Eric Cartman,"[humbly] Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh."
502,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?! [grabs Cartman by the collar] I should kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!"
503,8,2,Timmy Burch,[approaches] Timmah!
504,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,What?
505,8,2,Timmy Burch,[points to Jimmy] Timmah!
506,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[thinks a moment] Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right. [walks up to the mic and begins talking]"
507,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Everyone, can I have your attention, please? [everyone falls silent] I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting. [a shot of Nancy, injured and taped around the head. She smiles] A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him. [a shot of Timmy, who smiles and shows off his silver medal. Others around him wear bronzes.] Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics. [a shot of a chastened Cartman before the baseball players]"
508,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a [shot of Mark McGuire] big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say, [shot of Barry Bonds] ""Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- "" [shot of Jason Giambi] ""-steroid-taking jackass."" [Giambi nods ever so subtly] That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor. [applause rises from the stands, followed by cheers. The volunteers and baseball players gather around Jimmy]"
509,8,2,Mark McGuire,Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.
510,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids. [he looks at Kyle and then Stan for a reaction, but neither offers any. He frowns, then steps forward angrily] Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes! [straightens up] Grow up! [walks off in a huff]"
511,8,3,Eric Cartman,[in the driver's seat] Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
512,8,3,Stan Marsh,Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
513,8,3,Eric Cartman,"What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?"
514,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm a Vulcan!
515,8,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?"
516,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[looking into an imaginary viewer] The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing."
517,8,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, hang on. We're about to land. [the boys make landing noises, with Stan finishing off with a thump. Cartman removes his seatbelt] Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here."
518,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,No! I'm on the away team too! [he and Kenny remove their belts]
519,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[looks back] It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!"
520,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
521,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible."
522,8,3,Eric Cartman,Set phasers on stun.
523,8,3,Stan Marsh,Things seem pretty quiet.
524,8,3,Eric Cartman,Yes. A little too quiet.
525,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. [Cartman sighs silently]
526,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it! [the boys take their positions and start firing away] Oh no, it got Kyle!"
527,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,[stops firing and stands still] No it doesn't. [the other boys continue with their phaser noises]
528,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off! [pretends to be the monster ripping Kyle's head off] Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!"
529,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!"
530,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!"
531,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!"
532,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh God, here we go again."
533,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!"
534,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,He does not!
535,8,3,Eric Cartman,"How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it."
536,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,Naw uh!
537,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Go see the movie, Kyle!"
538,8,3,Stan Marsh,That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
539,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Me too!) [they leave]
540,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
541,8,3,Eric Cartman,"You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you."
542,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,People don't hate the Jews!
543,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[focuses Kyle's attention to him] Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson."
544,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,...You're a stupid asshole! [turns and walks off. Cartman turns left and glances at Kyle]
545,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Sweet, now I can just play with myself. [fires off his phaser] Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! [races into the minivan]"
546,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,One please.
547,8,3,Ticket Salesman,This is an R-rated movie.
548,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I know, but I have to-"
549,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it."
550,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"...Thanks. [makes his way towards the doors, glancing back at the cashier in wonder]"
551,8,3,Soldier 1,Hac bashtud Christo.
552,8,3,Soldier 2,Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad.
553,8,3,Jesus,"Wa! [the whipping begins and Jesus screams. This goes on for a long time. Kyle's mouth widens, his eyes get bigger. The next scene, he's got his coat over his mouth and he's almost in a fetal position. The next scene has him turned to his left, grimacing, his hat pulled over his ears as he winces. The next scene has him trembling]"
554,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,Haaaah! [Next scene has Kyle with his eyes squeezed shut and his hands over his face. He's now curled up in a ball]
555,8,3,Jesus,"Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!! [the whipping continues and Kyle dares to peek again. His stomach reacts and he vomits. The next scene has him almost passed out with vomit dribbling from his chin. The film ends and Kyle doesn't move.]"
556,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
557,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?"
558,8,3,Announcer,"And now, back to Terrance and Phillip. [the doorbell rings]"
559,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,"Hey Terrance, I think I have a-"
560,8,3,Eric Cartman,Mom! Doorbell!
561,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. [a second laughter and laughter is heard.]"
562,8,3,Eric Cartman,[the doorbell rings] Mom! Answer the door!
563,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
564,8,3,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, lazy-ass whore. [gets up and answers the door himself.]"
565,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,What?
566,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,Faaart.[Terrance farts. Cartman opens the door and sees Kyle soaking wet from the heavy rain]
567,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know."
568,8,3,Eric Cartman,"It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?"
569,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You were, you were right?"
570,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[closes his eyes and relishes the moment] Mmm, one more time, Kyle."
571,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,You were right. [Cartman opens his eyes and beams brightly]
572,8,3,Eric Cartman,"I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done. [a shot of Mel Gibson's poster, without the ""Braveheart"" on it.] Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen."
573,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now."
574,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Goddamn.)
575,8,3,Stan Marsh,[rises] Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
576,8,3,Stan Marsh,Dude. That movie sucked.
577,8,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it totally sucked!)"
578,8,3,Stan Marsh,How can they even call that a movie?
579,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know!)
580,8,3,Stan Marsh,"That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back."
581,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!) [they leave their seats]
582,8,3,Jack Garrett,"Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was."
583,8,3,Elise Garrett,"Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on! [they walk off, screen left. A second couple emerges]"
584,8,3,Man 1,"[brown shirt, green sweater] I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus."
585,8,3,Woman 1,"[orange blouse, necklace] Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing. [they walk off, screen right. Stan and Kyle come out and approach the window]"
586,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, we want our money back."
587,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Huh?
588,8,3,Stan Marsh,That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
589,8,3,Ticket Salesman,I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie.
590,8,3,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!"
591,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
592,8,3,Stan Marsh,You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
593,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins!"
594,8,3,Stan Marsh,"We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!"
595,8,3,Ticket Salesman,I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
596,8,3,Stan Marsh,W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
597,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Yeah. I'd like to see you try.
598,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! [he and Kenny storm off]"
599,8,3,Priests,"Kill him! Guilty! Kill him! [sketches of a nail driven through the left palm are animated, then a realistic view of Jesus crucified] Kill him! Kill him! Die!"
600,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! [a spear pierces Jesus' side. The one piercing him is Kyle himself, who seems to be relishing this, as he pierces Jesus a few more times. A review of images, then an image of Alan Alda, and Kyle wakes up frightened. After a few screams he looks around]"
601,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go. [clicks on the link] Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! ""For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."" Okay, okay, wait, here we go. [picks up the phone and dials in]"
602,8,3,Eric Cartman,Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
603,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion."
604,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m."
605,8,3,Stan Marsh,"No, no, no, no, we want our money back."
606,8,3,Eric Cartman,What?
607,8,3,Stan Marsh,We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
608,8,3,Eric Cartman,"You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes."
609,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!"
610,8,3,Eric Cartman,"If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick."
611,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!"
612,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!"
613,8,3,Stan Marsh,I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
614,8,3,Eric Cartman,Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
615,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!"
616,8,3,Eric Cartman,"I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!"
617,8,3,Stan Marsh,"[in recognition] Wait a minute. Cartman?! [realizing he's been recognized, Cartman is speechless]"
618,8,3,Eric Cartman,Eup. [hangs up and skulks away]
619,8,3,Stan Marsh,"[packing] Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!"
620,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Malibu? But how?)
621,8,3,Stan Marsh,"We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible! [He leads Kenny out of his room] This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!"
622,8,3,Liane Cartman,"Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?"
623,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did."
624,8,3,Liane Cartman,"Oh, that's great, sweetie."
625,8,3,Eric Cartman,[turns right so his profile will look sharp as well] Tell them I'll be down shortly
626,8,3,Liane Cartman,"Okay, hon."
627,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[wields his short whip]Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. [a shot of the poster.]"
628,8,3,Man 1,"Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?"
629,8,3,Jack Garrett,"No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise."
630,8,3,Elise Garrett,Hello.
631,8,3,Man 2,I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
632,8,3,Elise Garrett,Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
633,8,3,Man 2,And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
634,8,3,Jack Garrett,"Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?"
635,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!"
636,8,3,Woman 2,It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives. [Cartman approaches the dais.]
637,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah, hello everyone. Achtung. [the last few standing people take their seats] My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club. [applause] Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done."
638,8,3,Woman 3,[in pink dress] We sure do. [the crowd voices its approval]
639,8,3,Eric Cartman,"But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. [the guests fall silent]"
640,8,3,Elise Garrett,"[in orange blouse] Wha- what does that mean, sweetie?"
641,8,3,Jack Garrett,"I'm not sure, but- uh. [stands up] Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks. [the crowd voices its approval]"
642,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[bows a few times] Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we [his face turns ugly] all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion."
643,8,3,Man 3,"Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!"
644,8,3,Various Meeting Guests,"Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea."
645,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean."
646,8,3,Ticket Salesman,We sure do!
647,8,3,Various Meeting Guests,Yeah. All right. Woohoo!
648,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Thank you. [looks over his Map To The Stars' Homes] This must be the place. [they walk through a side door right under a guard's nose. He fails to notice them. They walk up the driveway and past the massive fountain] Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. [rings the doorbell. The door opens and Mel appears]"
649,8,3,Mel Gibson,Yes?
650,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny."
651,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hello.)
652,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?"
653,8,3,Mel Gibson,"You can't not like The Passion! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home. [leaves, but the boys follow him in.]"
654,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money."
655,8,3,Mel Gibson,"Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first. [unbuttons his shirt] But I won't tell you where I keep my money. [takes off his shirt] You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!"
656,8,3,Stan Marsh,Tor- torture you?
657,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[removes his pants and socks] Ha! So you do intend to torture me, huh?! [runs up to a torture rack and lies down in it] Well go ahead! Do your worst! [shackles himself in] You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out!"
658,8,3,Stan Marsh,We don't want to torture you.
659,8,3,Mel Gibson,"I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!"
660,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?"
661,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[unshackles himself and walks up to the boys] I have to use that money to build my church! I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church! And do you know why?! So I can play banjo! [whips out a hat and banjo, puts on the hat, and starts playing] Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!"
662,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!"
663,8,3,Mel Gibson,"How dare you call me crazy! This means war! [jumps up and whoops like an Indian, twirls around a few times, and fires off blanks at the boys. Stan and Kenny run]"
664,8,3,Father Maxi,"And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins."
665,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over."
666,8,3,Father Maxi,"...What is troubling you, my child?"
667,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord."
668,8,3,Father Maxi,Ah! You mean he's a Jew!
669,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night."
670,8,3,Father Maxi,"Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews."
671,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,But how can the Jews make it better??
672,8,3,Father Maxi,"Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement."
673,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course. [gets off the chair] I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. [turns and walks out]"
674,8,3,Stan and Kenny,Aaaah!
675,8,3,Mel Gibson,"Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me. [resumes hopping like a mad rabbit]"
676,8,3,Stan Marsh,Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude! [catches a glimpse of a wallet on a table] Wait! There's his wallet! [runs up to it with Kenny]
677,8,3,Mel Gibson,Freedom! [Stan grabs the wallet and rifles through it]
678,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? [Kenny hands Stan $2]"
679,8,3,Mel Gibson,Jesus is Lord! [Stan puts the $2 in and takes out $20]
680,8,3,Stan Marsh,"All right, let's get the hell out of here! [heads for the doors and opens one. Mel dances in wearing a Carmen Miranda outfit. Stan and Kenny head for another pair of doors. Stan opens it and Mel enters dressed as a clown]"
681,8,3,Mel Gibson,"When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!"
682,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Aah! Run, dude, run!"
683,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[hopping out behind them, in Braveheart face paint and wielding a sword] K'plagh! K'plagh! And good evening, frieeeeeeends!"
684,8,3,Eric Cartman,"One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message! [some applause] Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world! [the crowd applauds] Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!"
685,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Woah! Great idea!
686,8,3,Man 3,It'll be like a parade!
687,8,3,Man 4,Good idea!
688,8,3,Eric Cartman,"And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."""
689,8,3,Elise Garrett,"Well, what does that mean, dear?"
690,8,3,Jack Garrett,"Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie."
691,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Ooo, Aramaic. Cool."
692,8,3,Various Townsfolk,Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!
693,8,3,Jack Garrett,What was our Aramaic line again?
694,8,3,Eric Cartman,[pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets messed up from the impacts]
695,8,3,Various Townsfolk,"[repeats, gaining confidence with each syllable] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."
696,8,3,Eric Cartman,Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
697,8,3,Various Townsfolk,Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
698,8,3,Elise Garrett,"Oh, this is fun! [smiles]"
699,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[picks a mark in front of the crowd] All right, everyone! Forward, march! [they all move forward] Es ist Zeit für Rache!"
700,8,3,Various Townsfolk,Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
701,8,3,Eric Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache!
702,8,3,Various Townsfolk,Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
703,8,3,Eric Cartman,Nice.
704,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,"Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congregation. [Kyle approaches the lectern]"
705,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Thank you, rabbi. [Sheila smiles and gets Gerald's attention. Kyle clears his throat.] In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus."
706,8,3,Man 4,What? [others murmur their shock]
707,8,3,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat?!
708,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it."
709,8,3,Man 5,Oh my God! [the other congregants groan]
710,8,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!"
711,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I saw The Passion!
712,8,3,Man 6,Oh no! The Passion?! [others murmur]
713,8,3,Man 7,This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
714,8,3,Man 8,"Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes."
715,8,3,Man 9,Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
716,8,3,Woman 4,Something must be done to stop that movie!
717,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,"Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm."
718,8,3,Mob,[from outside] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
719,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[from outside] Es ist Zeit für Rache! [congregants rise and face the doors in the back, others look out the windows. They see Cartman leading a march past the synagogue]"
720,8,3,Mob,Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
721,8,3,Eric Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache!
722,8,3,Mob,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten! [the rabbi and his congregants look on, confused]"
723,8,3,Eric Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache!
724,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson. [net loss, sixty-nine dollars] But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters."
725,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. I agree.) [a truck horn blows and Stan stands to see who it is. Kenny joins him]
726,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. [Mel Gibson closes in fast in his Mad Max gas truck and wearing Braveheart face paint]"
727,8,3,Mel Gibson,Give me back my money! [blows his horn again]
728,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Goddamn, that guy's crazy. [hops off his seat and runs up to the driver] Hey dude, you've gotta speed up."
729,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,Huh?
730,8,3,Stan Marsh,Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
731,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,"Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games."
732,8,3,Stan Marsh,"I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- [Mel plows into the bus, making both vehicles screech. The riders sway in their seats]"
733,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,What the hell?
734,8,3,Mel Gibson,[shaking his fist in the air] Haaaa! K'Plaaaa!
735,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,Hey! That's Mel Gibson!
736,8,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I told you that!
737,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,"Well, what the hell does he want?!"
738,8,3,Stan Marsh,"He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it."
739,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. [Mel rams into them again]
740,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[to his parents] Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!"
741,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Can I help you?
742,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater!
743,8,3,Various Jewish Congregants,That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!
744,8,3,Shlomo,Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!
745,8,3,Man 1,We demand you stop showing it!
746,8,3,Various Jewish Congregants,Yeah! Yeah!
747,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[facing the congregants] No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob! [behind him Cartman is seen leading his mob to the theater] The last time we did that we killed Jesus!"
748,8,3,Eric Cartman,[points] Juden!
749,8,3,Jack Garrett,What's going on here?
750,8,3,Ticket Salesman,They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
751,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
752,8,3,Man 11,Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
753,8,3,Elise Garrett,It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
754,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
755,8,3,Jack Garrett,"Well, maybe you should apologize."
756,8,3,Mob,That's right! What he said.
757,8,3,Woman 5,"How dare you?! [the sound of a truck is faintly heard, but gets stronger.]"
758,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[noticing] Look out!! [The crowds move to the other side of the street as the tour bus skids to a stop just past the theater. Mel Gibson roars into town and crashes into the ticket booth, and his gas truck blows up. The crowds crawl out of their safety places and merge]"
759,8,3,Mel Gibson,Give me my eighteen dollars!
760,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Mel! Gibson! [brightens and approaches him, then grovels at his feet] Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding! [grovels some more] Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!"
761,8,3,Mel Gibson,"Ha! [ignores Cartman and walks up to Stan and Kenny] So! You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh? I guess now you're gonna start torturing me! Well! [grabs his nipples and falls on his knees. The crowd steps back as he twists his nipples] Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!"
762,8,3,Ticket Salesman,That's... Mel Gibson?
763,8,3,Jack Garrett,H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
764,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[backs up towards a building] Yeah... [grabs a piece of crap from his ass and removes it from his briefs, turns around, and defaces the building] I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?!"
765,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[joins Stan and Kenny] Dude, what's wrong with him?"
766,8,3,Stan Marsh,"He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind."
767,8,3,Mel Gibson,"You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you? [gets down on all fours and hoists his ass up] Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!"
768,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
769,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[rises and walks up to the boys] Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!"
770,8,3,Stan Marsh,It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
771,8,3,Mel Gibson,"You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!"
772,8,3,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results."
773,8,3,Jack Garrett,"You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ."
774,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
775,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!"
776,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. [a grinning Mel squats and farts on Cartman, defecating on Cartman]"
777,8,3,Mel Gibson,Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo! [hops towards the camera.]
778,8,4,Eric Cartman,"Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. [a car goes up a ramp and jumps off]"
779,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. [Stan's car is uncooperative]
780,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. [some kids come up behind Stan]"
781,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, who are those kids?"
782,8,4,Boombox,"Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!
[brief instrumental]
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance-"
783,8,4,OC Leader,"Yeah, how you like that y'all! [Stan and his friends merely look on]"
784,8,4,OC Member 1,[dressed in red] Let's bring it to these losers.
785,8,4,OC Girl,Aww yeah!
786,8,4,OC Leader,"Whatchoo got, huh?! You got nothin'!"
787,8,4,OC Leader,Damn! You just got served!
788,8,4,OC Leader,Aww man!
789,8,4,OC Girl,"He got you, dude."
790,8,4,OC Leader,Now that kid is gettin' served!
791,8,4,OC Girl,Uh huh.
792,8,4,OC,Whoa!
793,8,4,OC Leader,"Aww man, look at them! They know they can't trip to that! [the girl turns the radio off and the dancers turn and walk away.] Yeah! We're outta here!"
794,8,4,OC Member 2,"[in gray-green, looks left] That was smokin'!"
795,8,4,OC Member 1,[looks right] They didn't do nothin'!
796,8,4,OC Member 3,"[Asian, turns around] Sorry y'all, but try not to let it sting too bad! [laughs and turns around]"
797,8,4,OC Leader,[turns around] You got served! [the others laugh and he turns around] Come on! They had nothin'! Let's go y'all!
798,8,4,OC Member,Come on y'all! [...and they're gone]
799,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,...What the hell just happened?
800,8,4,Chef,"[opens up] Oh. Hello there, children!"
801,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we just got served."
802,8,4,Chef,"Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa."
803,8,4,Chef,"Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe. [the boys sit down] Are you all okay?"
804,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
805,8,4,Chef,"All right. Now, where did you get served?"
806,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-"
807,8,4,Chef,"Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight. [turns around and picks up the phone] I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay. [taps out a number and the phone rings] Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it."
808,8,4,Sharon Marsh,"Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay."
809,8,4,Randy Marsh,What's the matter with him?
810,8,4,Sharon Marsh,Oh. Stan got served at school today.
811,8,4,Randy Marsh,You got served? By who?
812,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Some, kids from Orange County."
813,8,4,Sharon Marsh,Let's not make a big deal out of it.
814,8,4,Randy Marsh,So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
815,8,4,Stan Marsh,No.
816,8,4,Randy Marsh,What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
817,8,4,Sharon Marsh,That was the right thing to do.
818,8,4,Randy Marsh,"No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak."
819,8,4,Stan Marsh,"But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'."
820,8,4,Randy Marsh,"[in low tones] Well then, it's about time you learned! [rises from the table] Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!"
821,8,4,Stan Marsh,But Dad-
822,8,4,Randy Marsh,Now! [walks off]
823,8,4,Randy Marsh,"All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this."
824,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stan."
825,8,4,Randy Marsh,"...six, seven, eight."
826,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that is a sweet RC car!"
827,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[carrying the car] Yeah, let's go race it right now![they run into the OC kids]"
828,8,4,OC Member 2,"Well, what we got here?"
829,8,4,OC Member 1,It's the white boys that were served yesterday. [they laugh]
830,8,4,OC Leader,"You want a little more, homeboys?"
831,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We're not interested, thanks."
832,8,4,OC Member 1,[steps forth] You're not interested? Not interested in this?
833,8,4,Boombox,"You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.
You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the OC crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare."
834,8,4,Black Man,"Oh Lord, look at those moves."
835,8,4,Black Woman,"Oooo, they are takin' it out!"
836,8,4,Black Man 2,"Oh man, they are getting served!"
837,8,4,Black Woman 2,"Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!"
838,8,4,Black Man 3,Have mercy!
839,8,4,Others,"Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin' served!"
840,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! Go Stan!
841,8,4,Chef,"Oh no! [begins to cross the street] No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'!"
842,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,All right Stan!
843,8,4,Eric Cartman,Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
844,8,4,OC Leader,Wha?
845,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! You got served!
846,8,4,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
847,8,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
848,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's right!
849,8,4,Eric Cartman,All right!
850,8,4,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
851,8,4,Chef,[arrives] No no no!
852,8,4,OC Leader,"Okay. All right. We got served. So now, I guess... It's on."
853,8,4,Stan Marsh,What?
854,8,4,OC Member 1,This Saturday! Our top five dancers against your top five dancers! OC Convention Center. It's on!
855,8,4,OC Members,It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
856,8,4,Townsman,[closes his eyes and laments] Oh Lord it's on!
857,8,4,Chef,Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
858,8,4,OC Member 3,"We'll see you Saturday, fools! [the crowd behind the OC crew parts and they leave]"
859,8,4,OC Members,"Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better dancers with you than those loozas! 'Cause it's on!"
860,8,4,OC Members,It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
861,8,4,Chef,"Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?"
862,8,4,Stan Marsh,I thought I was supposed to!
863,8,4,Chef,Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
864,8,4,Stan Marsh,But why?
865,8,4,Chef,"Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??"
866,8,4,Sharon Marsh,"[enters the kitchen with Stan] Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!"
867,8,4,Randy Marsh,[turns around] What?
868,8,4,Sharon Marsh,Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
869,8,4,Randy Marsh,So what happened?
870,8,4,Sharon Marsh,It's on!
871,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Come on now, keep it tight!"
872,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Good. Now watch that timing, drill team!"
873,8,4,OC Member 1,All right!
874,8,4,OC Girl,[stands] All right!
875,8,4,OC Leader,"Yeah, bad ass!"
876,8,4,OC Member 2,"Yeah, that was tight!"
877,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Not bad, kids. Not bad. [Randy approaches]"
878,8,4,OC Member 1,Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a chance!
879,8,4,OC Girl,I heard that!
880,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"All right, it was good. But we don't want ""good,"" we want pain!"
881,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Uh, hey, ex- excuse me."
882,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,[turns around] Yeah?
883,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm Stan Marsh's father."
884,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday?"
885,8,4,OC Member 3,Dang!
886,8,4,OC Leader,Oooooo!
887,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on."
888,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Oh, it's on!"
889,8,4,Randy Marsh,"No, no, no, it's not on."
890,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Whoo, it's on all right!"
891,8,4,Randy Marsh,It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
892,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,[insistent] It's on!
893,8,4,Randy Marsh,I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. [turns around and walks away]
894,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Hold on a second, clam-head! [catches him and blocks his way] You think you can just roll in here and tell us it's not on when it very clearly is on?! You're just trying to make us not practice, aren't you?! Because you know that your kids are goin' down when my kids give them this! Give me some moves out, Girl T! [the girl turns on the boombox] Check this out! [balances on his left hand and bounces around, then stands up] Yeah! You like that?!"
895,8,4,OC Leader,Oooo man! [shakes his head]
896,8,4,OC Member 1,Ohhh Lord!
897,8,4,OC Leader,"Oooo, he is gettin' served! [the girl shakes her head]"
898,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah."
899,8,4,Sharon Marsh,"[enters with Stan] Randy? [rushes to his bedside] Randy, oh my God!"
900,8,4,Skeeter,"What happened to him, Doctor?"
901,8,4,Dr Doctor,He got served. Worst I've ever seen.
902,8,4,Jimbo Kern,"Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce."
903,8,4,Chef,Oh Lord...
904,8,4,Randy Marsh,"[his voice raspy] His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive. [winces] Ungh! Grrgh."
905,8,4,Unnamed Nurse,"[soothing him] Shh. Relax, Mr. Marsh. [Dr. Doctor walks off]"
906,8,4,Dr Doctor,We just got the X-rays back. [walks to a backlit board and points out the injuries] He mostly got served here [a rib] and here [forearm]. But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one.
907,8,4,Jimbo Kern,"Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?"
908,8,4,Skeeter,"Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father! [looks over at his dad, then at the other men]"
909,8,4,Stan Marsh,"I, I don't know. He seems all right."
910,8,4,Mr Garrison,"I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!"
911,8,4,Randy Marsh,Stan? Stan?
912,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[walks to Randy's bedside] Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad."
913,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me."
914,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, good."
915,8,4,Randy Marsh,"[emphatic] But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. [passes out. The ""8 Mile"" theme begins to play and the camera closes in on Stan]"
916,8,4,Stan Marsh,[thinks and then walks off miffed] God dammit!
917,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?"
918,8,4,Michael,[with cigarette] Of course we know how to dance.
919,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?"
920,8,4,Pete,Dance troupe? Please. [leans to one side and whips his hair back into place] We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school. [whips his hair back into place] Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
921,8,4,Michael,Yeah. [stands up] The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette.
922,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served."
923,8,4,Pete,[flips his hair back] No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
924,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to the red Goth] Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?"
925,8,4,Pete,I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
926,8,4,Henrietta,Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
927,8,4,Firkle,I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.
928,8,4,Michael,"I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it. [rises and walks over to Stan]"
929,8,4,Stan Marsh,Great! [they leave together]
930,8,4,Henrietta,Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
931,8,4,Pete,Yeah. We just got Goth-served.
932,8,4,Stan Marsh,"All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance."
933,8,4,Michael,We should go to the arcade. [takes a drag from his cigarette]
934,8,4,Stan Marsh,The arcade?
935,8,4,Michael,Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. [takes a drag from his cigarette]
936,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's incredible."
937,8,4,Michael,"He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. [the game gets faster and faster and the kid keeps up. Eventually the game ends, the boy picks up his soda cup and walks away.]"
938,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[catches up to Yao at the change machine] Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?"
939,8,4,Yao,"You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?"
940,8,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
941,8,4,Yao,That's stupid. [waves him off and walks away]
942,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[catches up] Dude, we need you."
943,8,4,Yao,I can't dance without the machine.
944,8,4,Stan Marsh,It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
945,8,4,Yao,Okay. I'll give it a shot.
946,8,4,Stan Marsh,"All right, that's three!"
947,8,4,Michael,"Dude, we need a girl."
948,8,4,Stan Marsh,Huh?
949,8,4,Michael,We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.
950,8,4,Stan Marsh,Oh yeah. [thinks a bit with finger to chin] Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
951,8,4,Porsche,"Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?"
952,8,4,Stan Marsh,Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
953,8,4,Maury,"You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls. [Stan look at his crew. Moments later they are seated at the bar, with Mercedes]"
954,8,4,Stan Marsh,And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
955,8,4,Mercedes,"[twirling her hair] Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else."
956,8,4,Stan Marsh,So you'll do it?
957,8,4,Mercedes,Why not?
958,8,4,Stan Marsh,"All right, we just need one more person!"
959,8,4,Mercedes,"Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing."
960,8,4,Stan Marsh,What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
961,8,4,Mercedes,I think his name was... [closes her eyes] Leopold... Stotch or something?
962,8,4,Stan Marsh,Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
963,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-"
964,8,4,Linda Stotch,"[enters] Butters, you have some visitors. [Stan, Michael, Mercedes, and Yao appear]"
965,8,4,Butters Stotch,"[turns around] Oh well, hi there everybody. [his mom leaves]"
966,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe."
967,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?"
968,8,4,Stan Marsh,"It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. [his smile vanishes as he begins to think back, then a small grimace appears.]"
969,8,4,Butters Stotch,...No.
970,8,4,Stan Marsh,"But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska."
971,8,4,Butters Stotch,"No. [hops off the chair and runs away] No no no no no no, no! [runs into the living room and up the stairs] No! No no no no!"
972,8,4,Linda Stotch,Butters? [rises and looks up the stairs] Butters?! [Stan and the other kids enter]
973,8,4,Stan Marsh,We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
974,8,4,Linda Stotch,"Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy."
975,8,4,Mercedes,A tragedy?
976,8,4,Butters Stotch,[from his room] Waaaaah!
977,8,4,Linda Stotch,"I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go."
978,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?"
979,8,4,Yao,Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance.
980,8,4,Stan Marsh,"A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park."
981,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Aaaaah! [quickly throws the shoes and clippings away, then goes to cry into his pillow] Aaaaah!"
982,8,4,Stan Marsh,"All right, so you're sure he can dance?"
983,8,4,A Rancher,Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.
984,8,4,Yao,That don't look like a dancing duck to me.
985,8,4,A Rancher,"Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy."
986,8,4,A Rancher,"You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honeeey.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, babe."
987,8,4,A Rancher,"You'll do a line and I'll do a line, we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time.
Honey, babe, be mine.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey-"
988,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?"
989,8,4,A Rancher,"No no, he'll dance to anything. See?
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night and day.
Honey, babe, be mine."
990,8,4,Stan Marsh,"My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe."
991,8,4,Linda Stotch,"Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay. [a shot of Butters under the covers, with bug eyes] Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie."
992,8,4,Butters Stotch,Two years ago. Two years ago!
993,8,4,Announcer,"That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis, folks. Let her hear it! [she waves to the audience and walks off] All right, and now, dancing to the song ""I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You,"" here is Colorado state champion, Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch! [the audience applauds. The Stotches are present and clapping with the audience. The song begins to play, Butters begins to dance]"
994,8,4,Singer,"I've got something in my front pocket for you
Why don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it is
Then grab onto it, it's just for you
Give a little squeeze and say, ""How do you do?""
There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my front pocket,
There's something in my front pocket-"
995,8,4,Butters Stotch,Whoops.
996,8,4,Woman,Paul. Paul!
997,8,4,Butters Stotch,Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [a man is trampled to death underfoot. Butters watches the auditorium empty out] No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!
998,8,4,Chef,"All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'! [sets his stuff onto a table next to the door] We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be. [moves further into the studio] I think we should- [stops] Whoa. [a shot of the five dancers, including Jeffy, who quacks] This... is the dance troupe?"
999,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer."
1000,8,4,Chef,"Oh boy. [returns to his boombox] All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do!"
1001,8,4,Boombox,"You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.
You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the East-side crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare."
1002,8,4,Chef,"Oh Lord have mercy. [turns off the boombox] Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart. [scratches his head] No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent."
1003,8,4,Stan Marsh,"We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?"
1004,8,4,Yao,What? I don't wanna get served.
1005,8,4,Mercedes,"Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served."
1006,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- [the others also speak, the others continue to argue, talking over one another.]"
1007,8,4,Chef,"All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. [Stan droops his head.]"
1008,8,4,Butters Stotch,What do you want?
1009,8,4,Stan Marsh,"I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you."
1010,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore. [leaves his chair and walks up to his Lego box] I gave that up."
1011,8,4,Stan Marsh,Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
1012,8,4,Butters Stotch,[rummaging for Lego blocks to take back to his desk] Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
1013,8,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault.
1014,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Yeah well, you tell that to their families. [returns to his desk with a new batch of blocks]"
1015,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that."
1016,8,4,Butters Stotch,"[whirls around] I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!"
1017,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant."
1018,8,4,Butters Stotch,What?
1019,8,4,Stan Marsh,And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
1020,8,4,Butters Stotch,[cups his hear so he hears no more] Aaaah!
1021,8,4,Stan Marsh,"But that isn't the point, Butters! [Butters resumes building his tiny town] The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man."
1022,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Get out of my room, Stan."
1023,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[Firmly] Fine. [walks to the door and opens it] But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. [leaves and closes the door. Butters, angered, tosses some blocks into his town, then wipes the town off the desk.]"
1024,8,4,Unnamed MC,"Yeah, make some noise!"
1025,8,4,Unnamed MC,"Ladies and Gentlemen,"
1026,8,4,Unnamed MC,"man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim!"
1027,8,4,Lil Kim,"[high squeaky voice] What's up, niggaz?! [waves to the audience]"
1028,8,4,Unnamed MC,"This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all. So let's give it up for the OC Crew! [the crew is shown, then their parents in the audience are shown] And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!"
1029,8,4,Jimbo Kern,"Man, it is about to get crazy up in here."
1030,8,4,Mr Garrison,"Aww, yeah."
1031,8,4,Unnamed MC,A'ight y'all. It's showtime!
1032,8,4,Announcer,Dancers to the floor! [the OC Crew steps forth]
1033,8,4,Mercedes,"[runs up to Stan] Stan. Stan, we have a big problem!"
1034,8,4,Stan Marsh,What?
1035,8,4,Mercedes,It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.
1036,8,4,Stan Marsh,What happened??
1037,8,4,Mercedes,He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor.
1038,8,4,OC Member 3,"Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!"
1039,8,4,Yao,Can he move it?
1040,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Aw, what do we do, Chef?!"
1041,8,4,Chef,"Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit."
1042,8,4,OC Member 1,Looks like they ain't even gonna dance.
1043,8,4,OC Leader,They're too scared! Looks like they already got served!
1044,8,4,Butters Stotch,Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
1045,8,4,Stan Marsh,Butters! [the SP crew moves towards him]
1046,8,4,Chef,All right!
1047,8,4,Unnamed MC,"All right come on, let's do this! DJ! Give us a hot track!"
1048,8,4,CD,"Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!"
1049,8,4,CD,"Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!"
1050,8,4,CD,"Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you dance sucka!"
1051,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Waaah! [the spectators follow the shoe's arc. The shoe hits a stage light, which comes down and kills the OC leader. The OC coach comes forward] No! Jesus, not again!"
1052,8,4,OC Member 1,Aaaah!
1053,8,4,OC Member 3,Get out of here!
1054,8,4,Unnamed MC,"[walks up, sadly] Folks, it looks like the OC crew is dead. [excitedly] That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!"
1055,8,4,Skeeter,Woo!
1056,8,4,Mr Garrison,Yeah!
1057,8,4,Jimbo Kern,All right!
1058,8,4,Chef,All right! We did it! [he and the Diggitys approach Butters]
1059,8,4,Stan Marsh,All right Butters!
1060,8,4,Yao,You did it!
1061,8,4,Randy Marsh,"You did it, son! You did it!"
1062,8,4,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters!"
1063,8,4,Butters Stotch,No! No! Noooooo!
1064,8,5,Butters Stotch,What the heck?
1065,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Whoa! What a huge package! [finds it, the shipping label reads]"
1066,8,5,Butters Stotch,To Butters Stotch. Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me! [returns to the crate's label]
1067,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Who is it from? ""Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."" [skips around] Wow! A package for me from Japan!!"
1068,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11."
1069,8,5,Butters Stotch,Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package.
1070,8,5,Eric Cartman,[monotone] Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
1071,8,5,Butters Stotch,[dazzled] Whoa...
1072,8,5,Eric Cartman,I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
1073,8,5,Butters Stotch,[approaches AWESOM-O] You... you're my robot?
1074,8,5,Eric Cartman,Yes. I will be your new best friend.
1075,8,5,Butters Stotch,Oh wow!
1076,8,5,Butters Stotch,Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.
1077,8,5,Butters Stotch,Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.
1078,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Heheh, they're all so jealous! [He hops onto the bed next to Cartman.] I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have."
1079,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff."
1080,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh? [strokes his chin] Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesitated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter."
1081,8,5,Eric Cartman,[snickers] Really?
1082,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school. [Cartman begins to chuckle] You okay, AWESOM-O?"
1083,8,5,Eric Cartman,Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
1084,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum."
1085,8,5,Eric Cartman,"[laughs] That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets."
1086,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Hm, okay. Let's see [strokes his chin] Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff."
1087,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, really?"
1088,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days."
1089,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Heh. Wow, that sucks."
1090,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me."
1091,8,5,Eric Cartman,Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
1092,8,5,Butters Stotch,"No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! [hops off and walks towards his desk.]"
1093,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you."
1094,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!"
1095,8,5,Eric Cartman,What?
1096,8,5,Butters Stotch,"When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake."
1097,8,5,Eric Cartman,You saw that?
1098,8,5,Butters Stotch,Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
1099,8,5,Eric Cartman,Nuh uh.
1100,8,5,Butters Stotch,I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
1101,8,5,Eric Cartman,No way.
1102,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!"
1103,8,5,Eric Cartman,"[beat] ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?"
1104,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?"
1105,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?"
1106,8,5,Butters Stotch,How come?
1107,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O."
1108,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. [leaves the room]"
1109,8,5,Eric Cartman,"[moments later, still on the bed] Oh, son of a bitch!"
1110,8,5,Butters Stotch,Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
1111,8,5,Butters Stotch,"He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy."
1112,8,5,Butters Stotch,My robot friend.
1113,8,5,Butters Stotch,I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
1114,8,5,Butters Stotch,He's smart as can be and emotion-free
1115,8,5,Butters Stotch,"And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend."
1116,8,5,Butters Stotch,My robot friend.
1117,8,5,Butters Stotch,My robot friend.
1118,8,5,Butters Stotch,My robot... friend.
1119,8,5,Linda Stotch,"Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot."
1120,8,5,Stephen Stotch,[tosses the paper onto the couch arm as Linda serves him coffee] Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. [takes his cup]
1121,8,5,Butters Stotch,[leading Cartman to the stairs] That's great AWESOM-O! [Cartman carries a pile of clothes] You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
1122,8,5,Linda Stotch,"Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon."
1123,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime."
1124,8,5,Linda Stotch,"Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?"
1125,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?"
1126,8,5,Linda Stotch,"That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?"
1127,8,5,Eric Cartman,AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
1128,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah! Don't you know nothin' about robots? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! [Cartman follows Butters upstairs]"
1129,8,5,Linda Stotch,"Aw, that's just adorable."
1130,8,5,Stephen Stotch,It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
1131,8,6,Stan Marsh,"[stops and looks at a house] Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. [the other boys stop and look.]"
1132,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago."
1133,8,6,Eric Cartman,I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. [a door is heard opening]
1134,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[points] Hey Look!
1135,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Hello!
1136,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hey. Do you live here?
1137,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?"
1138,8,6,Eric Cartman,No.
1139,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything."
1140,8,6,Stan Marsh,What's that you're wearing?
1141,8,6,Blanket Jackson,It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
1142,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now."
1143,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
1144,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. [they turn away.]"
1145,8,6,Blanket Jackson,We have arcade games inside.
1146,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Dad?
1147,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Whoa. Dude, no way!"
1148,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, this is awesome! [runs up to a claw machine]"
1149,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, are these all your toys?"
1150,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games."
1151,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do?"
1152,8,6,Blanket Jackson,He's retired now.
1153,8,6,Eric Cartman,"[guiding the machine's arm to grab a plush toy] Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!"
1154,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. [guides the other three boys out]"
1155,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!"
1156,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Dad? You out here?
1157,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Here I am, Blanket!"
1158,8,6,Michael Jackson,Heeee!
1159,8,6,Michael Jackson,Jeh chabee durtah!
1160,8,6,Michael Jackson,Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!
1161,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] What's wrong with his face?
1162,8,6,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something."
1163,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-"
1164,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?"
1165,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Come on, let's climb the tree! [turns to a tree and scales it] Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree!"
1166,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree. 
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. 
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key."
1167,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up."
1168,8,6,Michael Jackson,Won't you imagine along with me?
1169,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Jefferson?
1170,8,6,Michael Jackson,"We can be spacemen, 
or pirates on the sea
Chuckajamonah!
Yes we can do everything,
and I mean, everything!
Chuckajamonah!
Up in my Wishing Tree!
Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!"
1171,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you guys! You guys! [the kids gather around] You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!"
1172,8,6,Red,The Jeffersons?
1173,8,6,Eric Cartman,[breathless] They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! [his chest heaves noticeably]
1174,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
1175,8,6,Eric Cartman,"They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train."
1176,8,6,Craig Tucker,[in a monotone voice] No way.
1177,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!"
1178,8,6,Craig Tucker,[not wanting to be left out] I believe in Mr. Jefferson!
1179,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!"
1180,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Who wants the first cotton candy?
1181,8,6,Kids,Memememememememememe
1182,8,6,Michael Jackson,Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!
1183,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!"
1184,8,6,Eric Cartman,Choo-choo train! Yay!
1185,8,6,Michael Jackson,Let's ride the train! The train!
1186,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?"
1187,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson."
1188,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Cartman, you have a beautiful voice."
1189,8,6,Eric Cartman,Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
1190,8,6,Michael Jackson,Let's ride and ride on the train together
1191,8,6,Eric Cartman,...Train together
1192,8,6,Michael Jackson,On a journey through both of our minds.
1193,8,6,Eric Cartman,I've got time. Do youuu??
1194,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what happened to your knee?"
1195,8,6,Blanket Jackson,[his skinned knee is shown] I fell down.
1196,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[calls out] Mr. Jefferson!
1197,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[back on the train] Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games."
1198,8,6,Eric Cartman,Choo-choo train.
1199,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr- ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. [takes Blanket inside]"
1200,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, this is gonna sting for a second."
1201,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Ow!
1202,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, I know. Be cool."
1203,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Thank you. That already feels better.
1204,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?"
1205,8,6,Blanket Jackson,I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
1206,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,And where is your mom?
1207,8,6,Blanket Jackson,I don't have a mom.
1208,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,You must have a mom.
1209,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?"
1210,8,6,Blanket Jackson,No. I was made in a laboratory.
1211,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1212,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home."
1213,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,So you never met your mom?
1214,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts."
1215,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Yeah, that counts."
1216,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!"
1217,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid."
1218,8,6,Eric Cartman,You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
1219,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one."
1220,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! [faces Kyle down] Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! [turns and walks away angrily]"
1221,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon."
1222,8,6,Stan Marsh,"I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons."
1223,8,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, are they nice people?"
1224,8,6,Stan Marsh,Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
1225,8,6,Sharon Marsh,"Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too."
1226,8,6,Gerald Broflovski,"So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?"
1227,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Kentucky, yeah."
1228,8,6,Randy Marsh,I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
1229,8,6,Michael Jackson,"No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant."
1230,8,6,Stephen Stotch,"What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?"
1231,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals"
1232,8,6,Sheila Broflovski,Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
1233,8,6,Michael Jackson,"I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child."
1234,8,6,Randy Marsh,....Yeeeah.
1235,8,6,Sharon Marsh,"...They are fun. [glances back, away from the table] Boys, you okay out there?"
1236,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Fine, Mom."
1237,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Wow, these are great. What are they called again?"
1238,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
1239,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden."
1240,8,6,Eric Cartman,What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
1241,8,6,Stan Marsh,"No, my parents are."
1242,8,6,Eric Cartman,You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
1243,8,6,Stan Marsh,What?
1244,8,6,Eric Cartman,"He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, [Stan steps back...] and I-"
1245,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!"
1246,8,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today."
1247,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?"
1248,8,6,Michael Jackson,[taken aback] D'huh?
1249,8,6,Stephen Stotch,I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
1250,8,6,Michael Jackson,I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.
1251,8,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?"
1252,8,6,Michael Jackson,Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.
1253,8,6,Harris,"Hey Sergeant, take a look at this."
1254,8,6,Harrison Yates,[disregards the sheet] Whatcha got?
1255,8,6,Harris,"Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money."
1256,8,6,Harrison Yates,"So, what's the problem?"
1257,8,6,Harris,Take a look. Says here... [the sergeant takes the sheet and reviews it] He's black.
1258,8,6,Harrison Yates,"By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe."
1259,8,6,Harrison Yates,Let's go people!
1260,8,6,Harrison Yates,"We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!"
1261,8,6,Stan Marsh,[looks out] Kyle?
1262,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'? [dances a little]"
1263,8,6,Stan Marsh,Mr. Jefferson Awww! [hops off the bed] It's 1:30 in the morning!
1264,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Look at me, I'm Peter Pan."
1265,8,6,Michael Jackson,"T-shamon!
I'm a little boy forever."
1266,8,6,Michael Jackson,Hey!
1267,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!"
1268,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!"
1269,8,6,Stan Marsh,He just showed up here.
1270,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. [a knock is heard at Stan's door]"
1271,8,6,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
1272,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard."
1273,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"[wearing his veil] Hi, Stan."
1274,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
1275,8,6,Stan Marsh,I know. He's here.
1276,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
1277,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!"
1278,8,6,Stan Marsh,"No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home."
1279,8,6,Michael Jackson,We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.
1280,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Dad says it wants to eat us.
1281,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!"
1282,8,6,Blanket Jackson,We're scared!
1283,8,6,Mr Jefferson,Hee hee!
1284,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!"
1285,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Blanket."
1286,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight"
1287,8,6,Eric Cartman,Deeper.
1288,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome."
1289,8,6,Michael Jackson,"I think you're awesome too, Cartman."
1290,8,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah?
1291,8,6,Michael Jackson,Yeah.
1292,8,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah?
1293,8,6,Michael Jackson,Yeah.
1294,8,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah?
1295,8,6,Stan Marsh,Ahaa!
1296,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[wakes up] What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?"
1297,8,6,Stan Marsh,Yeah. A really bad dream.
1298,8,6,Stan Marsh,Oh Jesus!
1299,8,6,Harrison Yates,"[using his walkie-talkie] Murphy, you inside?"
1300,8,6,Detective Murphy,"[walking through the arcade room] We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch!"
1301,8,6,Detective Murphy,I'm planting the cocaine now.
1302,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Johnson, what about you?"
1303,8,6,Johnson,"[in a closet] Placing the blood spatter now, sir. [right on a pair of Jefferson's shoes]"
1304,8,6,Harrison Yates,Frakes?
1305,8,6,Frakes,"Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir."
1306,8,6,Harrison Yates,"All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras. [sighs] Why do we do it, Harris?"
1307,8,6,Harris,Sir?
1308,8,6,Harrison Yates,Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
1309,8,6,Harris,"Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it."
1310,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride."
1311,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Stan, time to get up for school. [opens the door and looks in] Stan? What the-? [sees the five people in bed] Mr. Jefferson?!"
1312,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[sits up quickly] Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party."
1313,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!"
1314,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself."
1315,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. [gives each of them 100 dollar bills]"
1316,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. [leaves, and Sharon watches him go]"
1317,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. [quickly leaves with Blanket in tow]"
1318,8,6,Sharon Marsh,"Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?"
1319,8,6,Stan Marsh,"You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!"
1320,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! [Stan, Kyle, and Sharon are shocked]"
1321,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Come on, Blanket!"
1322,8,6,Harrison Yates,Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!
1323,8,6,Harris,[walks] Wha- wha- what?
1324,8,6,Harrison Yates,"It's Jefferson! He's back! [gets on his communicator] All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home."
1325,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Whoa, wait a minute! [withdraws his gun] That guy isn't black!"
1326,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus! [gets on his communicator] This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!"
1327,8,6,Harrison Yates,"You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!"
1328,8,6,Harris,It says right here on the final sheet he is!
1329,8,6,Harrison Yates,[shoves Harris's face against the windshield] Does that look like a black guy to you?!
1330,8,6,Harris,It said on the final sheet!
1331,8,6,Harrison Yates,[throws a fit] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!
1332,8,6,Harrison Yates,Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.
1333,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?"
1334,8,6,Harris,"Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it."
1335,8,6,Harrison Yates,[whips around and says menacingly] To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!
1336,8,6,Michael Jackson,"All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!"
1337,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[stops] That poor kid.
1338,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there."
1339,8,6,Blanket Jackson,[opens his windows as they approach] Hi guys!
1340,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?"
1341,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Really? You mean it?
1342,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[interrupts, clapping] Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!"
1343,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us."
1344,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!"
1345,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood."
1346,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket? [picks him up and moves him around through the open window] Wee, look! He can fly!"
1347,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[the boys fear for Blanket's life] Jesus Christ, dude!"
1348,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Aaaaaah! [Mr. Jefferson dangles him around by his left foot]
1349,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Stop, you fucking lunatic! [Mr. Jefferson's moustache falls off and down to the ground, he pulls Blanket back inside and closes the window]"
1350,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!"
1351,8,6,Michael Jackson,"No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look."
1352,8,6,Michael Jackson,Jeekabee durtah! [a kick and outstretched arm] Ow!
1353,8,6,Michael Jackson,"There, Blanket, shhhh. [tries to distract Blanket] Hey, hey look, hey look."
1354,8,6,Michael Jackson,"I got your nose. [does it again.] Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See?"
1355,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Aaaaaaaah! [throws it away and runs out of his bedroom]
1356,8,6,Michael Jackson,"No, Blanket, stop!"
1357,8,6,Michael Jackson,It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!
1358,8,6,Maggie Yates,"Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry."
1359,8,6,Harrison Yates,"I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force."
1360,8,6,Maggie Yates,Quitting the force? You?
1361,8,6,Harrison Yates,"None of it makes sense anymore. [sits down and unloads his frustrations] I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired."
1362,8,6,Maggie Yates,"[approaches and consoles him] Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yates. [he looks up at her] Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wiping that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrison Yates. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you. [she caresses him, he kisses her hand]"
1363,8,6,Harrison Yates,"And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. [abruptly rises and goes to the coat rack]"
1364,8,6,Maggie Yates,Where're you goin'?
1365,8,6,Harrison Yates,Think I've got a little more work to do. [puts on his coat and heads outside]
1366,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?"
1367,8,6,Michael Jackson,"No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!"
1368,8,6,Michael Jackson,I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!
1369,8,6,Michael Jackson,But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!
1370,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Oh, I'm melting!"
1371,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude."
1372,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"Yeah, sure, whatever."
1373,8,6,Stan Marsh,You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
1374,8,6,Kenny McCormick,Aren't I too big to be Blanket?
1375,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[seething as he climbs the ladder] I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! [Stan and Kenny follow]
1376,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Blanket, you in here?"
1377,8,6,Blanket Jackson,[excited] Hi guys!
1378,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? [Kenny looks around]"
1379,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
1380,8,6,Stan Marsh,"All right dude, get in his bed."
1381,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"[gets under the covers] All right, but you guys owe me for this."
1382,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. [hops off and leaves]"
1383,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl."
1384,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado."
1385,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?"
1386,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?"
1387,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves."
1388,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Well, he doesn't really look that black."
1389,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial."
1390,8,6,Harrison Yates,You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
1391,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges."
1392,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Molestation, nice."
1393,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarrassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!"
1394,8,6,Harrison Yates,"That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine."
1395,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure."
1396,8,6,Harrison Yates,[rises from his chair. Other officers draw near] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
1397,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson, hello?!"
1398,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us."
1399,8,6,Michael Jackson,What are you doing with my Blanket?
1400,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee! [an outstretched arm]"
1401,8,6,Stan Marsh,Haaaaa!
1402,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Haaaaa!
1403,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Haaaaa!
1404,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Go, go, ruuun! [the boys run out of the bathroom]"
1405,8,6,Mr Jefferson,[whispers as he walks] Sutah!
1406,8,6,Stan Marsh,Haaaaa!
1407,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Haaaaa!
1408,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Haaaaa!
1409,8,6,Michael Jackson,[rounds a corner onto the hallway] Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!
1410,8,6,Stan Marsh,[The boys enter Blanket's room] Oh Jesus!
1411,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"What the hell is going on, you guys?"
1412,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[enters and heads for Blanket's bed] My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket! [pulls Kenny out of the bed]"
1413,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!"
1414,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[tossing Kenny up into the air] Wee, he can fly! He can fly!"
1415,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-"
1416,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!"
1417,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
1418,8,6,Michael Jackson,Blanket? Blanket! Come play! [slowly approaches the boys]
1419,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Nooo! [Stan turns to leave]
1420,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[grabs Blanket's hand and leaves as well] Come on!
1421,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Run, Blanket, Run!"
1422,8,6,Blanket Jackson,[stumbles] Ah!
1423,8,6,Michael Jackson,[exits] Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!
1424,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[Kyle and Stan help Blanket up] Hang on, Blanket!"
1425,8,6,Mr Jefferson,[shielding his eyes] Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!
1426,8,6,Harrison Yates,"[through his bullhorn] Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!"
1427,8,6,Eric Cartman,"[hops to Mr. Jefferson's defense, standing in front of him] No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! [a crowd, including the boys' parents, gathers] All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!"
1428,8,6,Michael Jackson,It's ignorant.
1429,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child."
1430,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[returns with Blanket] All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!"
1431,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!"
1432,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[closeup for a few seconds] You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh. [genuflects behind Blanket] Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting."
1433,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.
1434,8,6,Harrison Yates,"[approaches with Harris] Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail."
1435,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,All right! Things just might work out!
1436,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change."
1437,8,6,Michael Jackson,"We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!"
1438,8,7,Woman,Yes?
1439,8,7,Eric Cartman,[sweetly] Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
1440,8,7,Woman,"Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?"
1441,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!"
1442,8,7,Woman,How about fifteen dollars?
1443,8,7,Eric Cartman,"It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work! [moments later, Stan and Kyle are clearing the driveway while Kenny clears the front lawn, moving by Cartman, who is now seated on the steps talking on a cell phone] Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. [Kyle walks up to him and stops] No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak. [notices Kyle, then lowers the phone] What?"
1444,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
1445,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm takin' a break."
1446,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
1447,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers."
1448,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,All you ever do is talk about your balls!
1449,8,7,Eric Cartman,"It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?"
1450,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,"If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!"
1451,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!"
1452,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?"
1453,8,7,Woman,"Oh goodness, what happened?"
1454,8,7,Eric Cartman,Shoveling accident.
1455,8,7,Woman,"Oooh, no, come on inside. [leads them in and stops in the middle of the living room, in front of the TV. A newscast is on] Wait right here, I'll be right back. [walks off]"
1456,8,7,Eric Cartman,"You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it."
1457,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, just keep your mouth shut."
1458,8,7,News Announcer,This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown. [the boys turn to watch]
1459,8,7,Aaron Brown,"[CNN anchor. An image of the humanoid is shown, with the caption ""Guest from the Future"" above it] Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car."
1460,8,7,Stan Marsh,Whoa.
1461,8,7,Aaron Brown,Christina Naylon has more.
1462,8,7,Christina Naylon,"[soldiers patrol the area around Hangar 18] The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?"
1463,8,7,Aaron Brown,"Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad?"
1464,8,7,Brad Morgan,"[inside the base. Scientists and soldiers mill around the alien's bed] Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Uh, he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh, to find a job here."
1465,8,7,Aaron Brown,"Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work?"
1466,8,7,Brad Morgan,"Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi- his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundreds of dollars, but uh, enough, he says, to feed his family."
1467,8,7,Aaron Brown,"And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison?"
1468,8,7,Harrison Moore,"[at the time portal. News vans, reporters and scientists, one in a space suit, gather around and marvel at the portal] Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay."
1469,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!"
1470,8,7,Randy Marsh,"We know, Stanley. We've been watching."
1471,8,7,Aaron Brown,"If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time."
1472,8,7,Harrison Moore,"Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived! [the camera pans right to show a HazMat team checking the person for radiation] It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family."
1473,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"There you go. All set, sweetie?"
1474,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em."
1475,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep. [turns off Stan's lamp] You've had a busy day. [walks off. At the door she turns and looks at him] Goodnight, sweetie."
1476,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Night, Mom. [after she leaves, he puts his arms up and behind his head and smiles] Wow, two people from the future. How cool."
1477,8,7,Mrs Landis,Yes?
1478,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?"
1479,8,7,Mrs Landis,"Ooh, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it."
1480,8,7,Eric Cartman,What?! Who?!
1481,8,7,Mrs Landis,One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.
1482,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
1483,8,7,Stan Marsh,"All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. [the boys turn to go back to the sidewalk...]"
1484,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. [the camera pulls back to show these immigrants shoveling snow off sidewalks and driveways up and down the street]
1485,8,7,Stan Marsh,Son of a bitch!
1486,8,7,Aaron Brown,"Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?"
1487,8,7,Chris Holt,"[seated to Brown's left] Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. I- it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races. They are all one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish whitish color. Uh, it seems race is no longer an issue in the future, because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language. The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this: [makes three guttural sounds] Back to you, Aaron."
1488,8,7,Aaron Brown,"Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America."
1489,8,7,Man 1,"[left side, front row] This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!"
1490,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"[at the podium] All right, folks, my name is Darryl Weathers and I'm with the Construction Workers' Union. I work with a lot of fine men who have families to feed. Now, I don't know about you all, but we worked long and hard to get our pay up to a level where we could make a decent living. And now these people from the future are showin' up and offerin' to do the same work for next to nothin'! They took our jobs! [the audience, which is unemployed, clamors in agreement]"
1491,8,7,Man 2,"[rises, wears dark blue short-sleeve shirt, black pants] We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs!"
1492,8,7,Man 3,They took your jobs! [the rest of the audience clamors]
1493,8,7,Man 4,Well what about us in the fast-food business?! The restaurants are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less! They took our jobs!
1494,8,7,Other Men,[at random times] They took your jobs!
1495,8,7,Stan Marsh,"[pipes up] It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too! [silence] Oh, they took our jobs!"
1496,8,7,Other Men,[at random times] They took yer jobs!
1497,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?"
1498,8,7,Stan Marsh,I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to- [an immigrant descends the stairs with a basket of dirty clothes and stops to ask Sharon something using guttural sounds]
1499,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? [the immigrant makes some guttural sounds and walks away]"
1500,8,7,Stan Marsh,[leery] Who is that?
1501,8,7,Randy Marsh,"That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays. [aside] And she'll do it for ten cents an hour."
1502,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!"
1503,8,7,Sharon Marsh,What?!
1504,8,7,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God! [he and Sharon rise, Stan backs away a bit] Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!"
1505,8,7,Sharon Marsh,Who taught you to talk like that?!
1506,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away."
1507,8,7,Randy Marsh,They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
1508,8,7,Stan Marsh,I wanted my job!
1509,8,7,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!"
1510,8,7,Sharon Marsh,That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
1511,8,7,Stan Marsh,Timecist?
1512,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"You know, a racist, but against people from the-"
1513,8,7,Stan Marsh,"People from the future. Right, got it."
1514,8,7,Randy Marsh,"All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking."
1515,8,7,Announcer,"And now, here is Bill O'Reilly."
1516,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"Welcome, welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right? And what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future. All right? Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it. All right? But others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off. All right? Now, I've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter. On my right is pissed-off, white-trash, redneck conservative."
1517,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Thanks for having me, Bill."
1518,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"And on my left is aging, hippie, liberal douche."
1519,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,Hello.
1520,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal, all right?"
1521,8,7,Darryl Weathers,You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans! [leans in and low and almost grunts] They took our jobs!
1522,8,7,Skynard Man,They took our jobs!
1523,8,7,Darryl Weathers,Those jobs belong to people from the present!
1524,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"All right. What say you, aging hippie liberal douche?"
1525,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"Heh, it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away?"
1526,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"All right, redneck, your rebuttal?"
1527,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"[says nothing, then rises, leans forward and low, and almost grunts] They took our jobs!"
1528,8,7,Skynard Man,They took our jobs!
1529,8,7,Stout Man,[really slurring] Too-kourderb!
1530,8,7,Herbert Garrison,"All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak."
1531,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
1532,8,7,Herbert Garrison,"So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs. Remember that there are transitive verbs such as [writes on the board] ""The boy threw the red ball,"" which in Futurespeak of course, is [makes a sentence of grunts and guttural sounds] Everyone say it with me? [the kids repeat the sentence, which sounds like a series of barks, coming from them. Jimmy attempts it] Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as [writes on the board] ""The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late."" Or in Futurespeak, ""Vvut."""
1533,8,7,The Kids,"""Vvut."""
1534,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!"
1535,8,7,Craig Tucker,Yeah!
1536,8,7,Stan Marsh,That's right! [other students speak up]
1537,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"[steps in] Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture. Who are we to say our language is best? They deserve to have an education just as much as you do."
1538,8,7,Herbert Garrison,"Thank you, aging, hippie, liberal douche."
1539,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,You betcha. [steps out]
1540,8,7,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
1541,8,7,Herbert Garrison,"Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this? [writes on the board] ""The sad girl puts balls in her mouth."" Or, in Futurespeak of course, ""Gluch gligh balls glych gligh."""
1542,8,7,Man 5,This is bullcrap!
1543,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman. [unfurls a letter] ""Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane."""
1544,8,7,Chet,What? That's ridiculous!
1545,8,7,Man 6,They can't do that!
1546,8,7,Man 7,That was a good idea!
1547,8,7,Darryl Weathers,So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening!
1548,8,7,Man 8,"Hey, that's right! If there is no future, then there'll be no people from the future to come back and take our jobs!"
1549,8,7,Man 9,Take r jurbs
1550,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening?"
1551,8,7,Chet,"How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and it ushers in a new ice age?"
1552,8,7,Darryl Weathers,[pause] How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?!
1553,8,7,Chet,"Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'?"
1554,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like?"
1555,8,7,Chet,Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.
1556,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs!"
1557,8,7,Many Men,[randomly] They took our jobs!
1558,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, dude."
1559,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,Gaur da'ka?
1560,8,7,Stan Marsh,Can you speak in present-day English please?
1561,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,Uh oh... Can I help... you?
1562,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries."
1563,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,"[looks at the boys quizzically, then shows off the chicken sandwich to his left] Chicken sandwich?"
1564,8,7,Stan Marsh,"[getting annoyed] No, a double cheeseburger and fries!"
1565,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,[taps away at the machine's keyboard] A cheeg- fry?
1566,8,7,Stan Marsh,What?!
1567,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,A cheeg- fry?
1568,8,7,Eric Cartman,"We can't understand you, asshole! [the cashier's manager comes up and talks to him for a bit. The cashier points at the boys. The manager takes over and resets the order]"
1569,8,7,Wendell's Manager,Can I help you?
1570,8,7,Stan Marsh,I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
1571,8,7,Wendell's Manager,[shows off the chicken sandwich to his left] Chicken sandwich?
1572,8,7,Stan Marsh,"No, it's not a chicken sandwich! [his parents enter the restaurant and stand in line behind him and the boys] I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!"
1573,8,7,Randy Marsh,Stan Marsh!
1574,8,7,Stan Marsh,Aw- awwww!
1575,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs!"
1576,8,7,Man 1,"Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should all take off all our clothes, scramble into a big pile and start gettin' gay with each other."
1577,8,7,Chet,"Did you say ""get gay""?"
1578,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Hey, yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!"
1579,8,7,Man 11,What? Gettin' gay?
1580,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs!"
1581,8,7,Jimbo Kern,I ain't turnin' queer.
1582,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"You have to, Jimbo, or else we won't be able to stop them! They took 'r jaobs!"
1583,8,7,Man 2,"Yeah, they took our jobs!"
1584,8,7,Man 8,[slurring] Took our jobs!
1585,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"[begins to take off his clothes till he's in briefs and boots] Let's go over to that part of town that all the future people moved into and start humpin' each other until they disappear! Come on! [comes down from the podium and makes his way to the doors. His briefs fall off, and he turns around] Come on! You want your jobs back or not?! [turns around, walks out and turns right]"
1586,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"[appears with the other rally participants, all of them naked] All right, you future bastards! Think you can take our jubs?! Well, we'll show you! Come'ere, Earl!. [the burly man wearing the Skynard hat steps forth and starts making out with Weathers] How do you like that, gooback?! [the immigrants just stare back puzzled. Weathers addresses the rest of his peers] Come on, you guys! [the other men just stare for a while, then begin to make out as well. The immigrants just look at them.] Everyone who believes in America, join in with us! We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent!"
1587,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?"
1588,8,7,Randy Marsh,"Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth! [Randy opens the door and they both go inside. The office walls are now brown instead of gray. Randy closes the door and motions Stanley to a chair behind it] You just sit right there, Stanley, and you think about what you've done! [puts his coat on the coat rack and sits at his desk to begin his day]"
1589,8,7,Boss,You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh-
1590,8,7,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Mr. Nelson."
1591,8,7,Mr Nelson,"Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here."
1592,8,7,Randy Marsh,Why? This is my office.
1593,8,7,Mr Nelson,"Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooh, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced."
1594,8,7,Randy Marsh,What?
1595,8,7,Mr Nelson,"Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk."
1596,8,7,Mr Glughgogawk,Gheglo.
1597,8,7,Randy Marsh,You can't be serious.
1598,8,7,Mr Nelson,"I'm... sorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some time to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room. [walks away with the immigrant. Randy is left alone to contemplate his next move]"
1599,8,7,Randy Marsh,Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
1600,8,7,Stan Marsh,They took yer jarb!!
1601,8,7,Announcer,This is CNN.
1602,8,7,Aaron Brown,Breaking news at the time border. We go now live to Harrison Moore.
1603,8,7,Harrison Moore,"Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out. [more immigrants enter through the portal] Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another. [a shot of all the men in a big pile, in all sorts of positions, as news crews film them] These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh. [Randy steps into view, patting his moustache down] Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?"
1604,8,7,Randy Marsh,"We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands. [another camera view shows Stan next to his father. Stan tries to block out this interview with eyes shut tight and his fingers on his nose] We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!"
1605,8,7,Darryl Weathers,Yeah America! [A close-up of the mass of men fornicating with each other]
1606,8,7,Man 8,Take our jobs!
1607,8,7,Harrison Moore,Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?
1608,8,7,Randy Marsh,"All we can do is try, Harrison."
1609,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,[walks into the picture] Trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant. Those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness.
1610,8,7,Harrison Moore,"[lowers the mic to Stan] Young man, what do you think about all this?"
1611,8,7,Stan Marsh,"I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us. [loosens up and opens his eyes] They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. [the mound of men stops copulating]"
1612,8,7,Man 9,[at the top of the mound] Huh?
1613,8,7,Stan Marsh,"I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work."
1614,8,7,Man 11,"[inside the mound] Hey. He's right. If we build for a better future, the immigrants will stay there."
1615,8,7,Man 12,Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow.
1616,8,7,Randy Marsh,Well what are we waiting for?
1617,8,7,Singer,"We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me."
1618,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Look, it's working! [one by one, the immigrants vanish from view]"
1619,8,7,Singer,The future begins with you and me.
1620,8,7,Darryl Weathers,The immigrants are fadin' away!
1621,8,7,Stan Marsh,We're doing it!
1622,8,7,Singer,"We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future-"
1623,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second. [drops his shovel] This is gay."
1624,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,[drops his shovel] This is really gay.
1625,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other."
1626,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile. [everyone races back to the pile. The men take off their clothes]"
1627,8,7,Darryl Weathers,Back in the pile everyone!
1628,8,7,Randy Marsh,We're going back to the pile.
1629,8,7,Man 13,Jump in!
1630,8,7,Man 14,"Come on, everybody!"
1631,8,7,Man 15,"Never mind, we're going back to the pile!"
1632,8,7,Man 16,Took yer jurb!
1633,8,8,Cheerleaders,"We are South Park, Green and White. Let's go, Cows! Fight, fight, fight! Nobody can beat a Cow! Let's gooo, South Park!

 [in the audience, Cartman yawns.]"
1634,8,8,Red,"Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit?"
1635,8,8,Students,[all grades] Moooooooo!
1636,8,8,Bebe Stevens,"I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?"
1637,8,8,Mandy,"[new fourth grader, with braces that makes her speak with a lisp] Yeah, and South Park is really gonna stick it to Littleton next week!"
1638,8,8,Bebe Stevens,"Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! [an adult in a cow suit comes out, waves to the kids, then begins to dance.]"
1639,8,8,Butters Stotch,"It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!"
1640,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, shut the hell up! [As Mooey dances, PETA bursts in through the double doors and rushes towards the cheerleaders. They apprehend Mooey and begin beating him up, then pulling his head off]"
1641,8,8,Blonde PETA Woman,[through her megaphone] We are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals! We protest your insensitive use of cows as your school mascot!
1642,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, Jesus, not PETA again."
1643,8,8,Dreadlocked PETA Man,[approaches Bebe] Cows are maimed and slaughtered and used as a commodity! [throws a bucket of real blood on Bebe. Other PETA members go after the rest of the cheerleaders]
1644,8,8,Blonde PETA Woman,[showing old slaughterhouse scenes on how to prepare beef] This is the fate of the cow! This is your insensitivity!
1645,8,8,Students,Ewww! [a kindergartner begins to cry]
1646,8,8,Gas Mask PETA Member,The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity! To be thrown away by a society gone wrong!
1647,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we are going to change our school mascot."
1648,8,8,Class,Awwwwwwww!
1649,8,8,Stan Marsh,"But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!"
1650,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win. [approaches the students with a stack of papers and begins distributing it] Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot."
1651,8,8,Clyde Donovan,But we like being the Cows! [a bucket of real blood is doused on him and the rest of the class gasps.]
1652,8,8,Dreadlocked PETA man,You're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions!
1653,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"[taking action] Ge-get outta here, PETA! We're changin' the mascot already!"
1654,8,8,Dreadlocked PETA man,Who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves?!
1655,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"[throws some papers at the PETA member] Oh, ge-get outta here! [breaks out a can of mace and sprays it on him] Ge-get out! [the man leaves] Jesus, where do they keep coming from?! [sprays some more for effect] Go on, get outta here."
1656,8,8,Stan Marsh,"This is bullcrap, dude!"
1657,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians..."
1658,8,8,Wendy Testaburger,But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
1659,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people."
1660,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot."
1661,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Giant Douche."""
1662,8,8,Eric Cartman,Ye-heah!
1663,8,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, totally awesome!)"
1664,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Turd Sandwich."""
1665,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
1666,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!"
1667,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""Giant Douche!"" It's way funnier!"
1668,8,8,Eric Cartman,It is not!
1669,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?"
1670,8,8,Kenny McCormick,(Giant douche.)
1671,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week."
1672,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?"
1673,8,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I really don't care. [walks away]"
1674,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[tallies the votes. Behind him, Butters approaches his locker and prepares to open it] That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche."
1675,8,8,Eric Cartman,"[notices, then runs to Butters and pulls him towards the other boys] ...Wait, wait, what about Butters?"
1676,8,8,Butters Stotch,Huh?
1677,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,You hate Butters.
1678,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?"
1679,8,8,Butters Stotch,"Hahaha, a turd sandwich!"
1680,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You misled him, fatass!"
1681,8,8,Eric Cartman,"It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it."
1682,8,8,Butters Stotch,[crosses his arms] Yeah! ...What's this for? [the boys approach Jimmy]
1683,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier."
1684,8,8,Jimmy Valmer,"That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea."
1685,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,A giant douche.
1686,8,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?"
1687,8,8,Eric Cartman,A turd sandwich.
1688,8,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds. [ten seconds pass] Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?"
1689,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,Giant douche.
1690,8,8,Jimmy Valmer,[snickers] And the second?
1691,8,8,Eric Cartman,Turd sandwich.
1692,8,8,Jimmy Valmer,"[snickers] Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds.[ten seconds pass] All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?"
1693,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,A giant douche.
1694,8,8,Jimmy Valmer,"[snickers] Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?"
1695,8,8,Eric Cartman,Turd sandwich.
1696,8,8,Jimmy Valmer,"[snickers] Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire."
1697,8,8,Eric Cartman,Awwwww!
1698,8,8,Butters Stotch,"Ohhh, we lost?"
1699,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, it's decided. Let's all write in ""Giant Douche."""
1700,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay. You win, Kyle."
1701,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche. [a giant douche steps out from behind the TV and begins dancing to 2 Unlimited's ""Get ready for this.""]"
1702,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, giant douche!"
1703,8,8,Kenny McCormick,"Go, giant douche!"
1704,8,8,Giant Douche,"Hey, South Park! Have we got school spirit?! [a smattering of applause] We've got spirit, yes we do! Giant douches, me and you! Let's gooooo, Douches! [a smaller smattering of applause]"
1705,8,8,Herbert Garrison,"And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich. [a turd sandwich steps out from behind the TV and begins dancing to Baha Men's ""Who Let The Dogs Out?""]"
1706,8,8,Eric Cartman,All right turd sandwich!
1707,8,8,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
1708,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman? What the hell?!
1709,8,8,Eric Cartman,Giant Douche sucks!
1710,8,8,Turd Sandwich,"We've got spirit, yes we do! We are sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh! [a smattering of applause]"
1711,8,8,Herbert Garrison,Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.
1712,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You won't get more votes than us, asshole!"
1713,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Game on, Jew-boy!"
1714,8,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! [looks at Cartman, smiles, and looks back at Kyle]"
1715,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
1716,8,8,Kenny McCormick,(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)
1717,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,Giant Douche is your man!
1718,8,8,Stan Marsh,"[exiting] Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?"
1719,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. [something like an ice cream truck is heard, and Cartman appears driving his Big Wheels bike, pulling a portable stage. Butters is dancing on the stage, dressed as a Hawaiian hula dancer. In his hands he has leis to hand out.]"
1720,8,8,Eric Cartman,"Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives. [Butters begins tossing out the leis, and kids step forth to get them. A man shows up as well, but gets nothing] Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!"
1721,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
1722,8,8,Stan Marsh,I'm not voting!
1723,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!"
1724,8,8,Stan Marsh,I just think this whole thing is stupid! [walks off angrily]
1725,8,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy."
1726,8,8,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
1727,8,8,Sharon Marsh,"How was school today, Stanley?"
1728,8,8,Stan Marsh,It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
1729,8,8,Sharon Marsh,...What did you say?
1730,8,8,Randy Marsh,Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
1731,8,8,Stan Marsh,"No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point."
1732,8,8,Randy Marsh,"[clenches his fists] You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!"
1733,8,8,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!"
1734,8,8,Stan Marsh,"Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care."
1735,8,8,Randy Marsh,[jumps upright and plants his hands on the table] You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
1736,8,8,Sharon Marsh,"Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms."
1737,8,8,Randy Marsh,You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
1738,8,8,Sharon Marsh,"It's sexist, is what it is!"
1739,8,8,Randy Marsh,"You don't understand the issues, Sharon!"
1740,8,8,Sharon Marsh,Are you calling me ignorant?!
1741,8,8,Randy Marsh,You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
1742,8,8,Sharon Marsh,"I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! [picks up the casserole and chucks it at Randy, who ducks and looks back at her angrily. They both leave the table in opposite directions.]"
1743,8,8,Shelly Marsh,"[leaving the table as well] I hate this family, I hate it! [Stan looks on, shocked, while Marvin continues eating unruffled. The door bell rings. Stan leaves the table and opens the front door. A black man is outside... with his posse]"
1744,8,8,Stan Marsh,Puff Daddy?
1745,8,8,Puff Daddy,Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting.
1746,8,8,Stan Marsh,I...
1747,8,8,Puff Daddy,"Apparently, you haven't heard of my ""Vote or Die"" campaign. [holds up a shirt with the slogan on it]"
1748,8,8,Stan Marsh,"""Vote or Die""? [upset] What the hell does that even mean?!"
1749,8,8,Puff Daddy,"[whips out a gun from his back pocket, cocks it, and aims it at Stan] What you think it means, bitch!"
1750,8,8,Stan Marsh,Aaaah!
1751,8,8,Posse,"Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!"
1752,8,8,Puff Daddy,Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye.
1753,8,8,Posse,Democracy is founded on one simple rule!
1754,8,8,Puff Daddy,Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you.Yeah.
1755,8,8,Puff Daddy,"I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
Shake them titties when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
[seated as two women dance for him, their asses in his face]
I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof (mouth roof)
[gently spanks a woman as she goes in to vote]
Now get your big ass in the pollin' booth.
[Fish-eye overhead view of Puff Daddy. He shoves his gun into the camera]
I said vote, bitch, or I'll fucking kill you!"
1756,8,8,Posse,"Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!"
1757,8,8,Puff Daddy,"You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!"
1758,8,8,Posse,Let your opinion be heard! You gotta make a choice
1759,8,8,Puff Daddy,"'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice [Stan runs again, looking behind him, but runs into a gun in his face]"
1760,8,9,Eric Cartman,"You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants."
1761,8,9,Stan Marsh,...What?
1762,8,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. [laughs heartily. The other boys stop]"
1763,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"That is fucking stupid, Cartman!"
1764,8,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!"
1765,8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Hey everybody, it's time! [everyone stops and looks] It's time!"
1766,8,9,Townsfolk,"[a small group] It's time. Oh, it's time? It's happening. It's happening now? Let's go! [they move off to their left]"
1767,8,9,Stan Marsh,It's time for what?
1768,8,9,Herbert Garrison,Get down to Metzger's Field! It's about to happen! [everyone follows him towards the field]
1769,8,9,Wall-Mart Manager,People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart! [the camera zooms out to show the full scope of the store. Everyone applauds and cheers]
1770,8,9,Randy Marsh,"[hugging Sharon] Look at it, honey. It's so big."
1771,8,9,Herbert Garrison,[hugging Mr. Slave] It's like we're a real town now. [the boys finally arrive]
1772,8,9,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, awesome!"
1773,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
1774,8,9,Man,Yeah! Now it's a Wall-Mart!
1775,8,9,Wall-Mart Manager,"I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change... [walks over to the entrance, which has a banner across it: ""Grand Opening.""] Now, shop friends. Shop! [steps aside and the doors open to a spacious store. The townsfolk rush inside]"
1776,8,9,Randy Marsh,It's beautiful!
1777,8,9,Marvin Marsh,[greeting shoppers at the door.] Welcome to Wall-Mart. Welcome to Wall-Mart. ...Welcome to Wall-Mart.
1778,8,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Sharon, isn't that your father?"
1779,8,9,Sharon Marsh,Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
1780,8,9,Jimmy Valmer,"[approaching] Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?"
1781,8,9,Sharon Marsh,"Why yes, I'd love one, Jimmy. [Jimmy turns and approaches a line of carts. He tugs at the one in the front, wrestling it away from the other carts. Once it's out far enough, he jumps to the rear and pushes it out]"
1782,8,9,Chef,[awestruck] My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.
1783,8,9,Eric Cartman,"[the boys are in the movie aisle] Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!"
1784,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
1785,8,9,Eric Cartman,Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
1786,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You only need one copy, r-tard!"
1787,8,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!"
1788,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, fine, I will! [grabs a copy] H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! [puts it back]"
1789,8,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you can't shop for crap. [a wide shot of the store]"
1790,8,9,Elderly Woman,[shopping with her husband] I can't believe these bargains.
1791,8,9,Wall-Mart Manager,[from an office window above the showroom floor] Fools. Ignorant fools.
1792,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. [three huge pallets of ramen are shown]"
1793,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?"
1794,8,9,Randy Marsh,"It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it."
1795,8,9,Whispers,"Six ninety-nine, fifteen dollars, free for fifteen ninety-eight..."
1796,8,9,Randy Marsh,"[suddenly awake] Aaaah! [looks at the window and crawls out of bed, then walks towards the window. He plants his hands on the window panes, and in the distance he sees that great shining beacon called Wall-Mart. He opens his pajama shirt and presses his body against the window. A soft sigh leaves his lungs...] Yeaaah... [Sharon wakes up]"
1797,8,9,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, what are you doing?!"
1798,8,9,Randy Marsh,[wraps himself up again and goes back to bed] Anu-nothing! [puts on his slippers] I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
1799,8,9,Sharon Marsh,It's almost midnight.
1800,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there. [with determination] I can have all the bargains to myself! [heads out]"
1801,8,9,Elderly Woman,Thanks for coming to Wall-Mart. [waves] All are welcome. All are welcome! [Randy is stunned that he's not the only shopper there]
1802,8,9,Eric Cartman,Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
1803,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. [they pass by a man closing up his shop for the last time]"
1804,8,9,Mr Farkle,"Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business."
1805,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Why, Mr. Farkle?"
1806,8,9,Mr Farkle,"I can't compete with Wall-Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can't make ends meet. [Cartman pulls out a violin from somewhere and begins playing it masterfully] I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work."
1807,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[glares at Cartman] Cartman, stop it!"
1808,8,9,Eric Cartman,"What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle."
1809,8,9,Mr Farkle,"I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll have to try somewhere else in town. [walks away sobbing]"
1810,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"See?! That sucks, dude!"
1811,8,9,Eric Cartman,"What? That's called progress, Kyle."
1812,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores? [Cartman whips out the violin and plays it again] And what about all the- [looks at Cartman, takes away his violin, breaks it in half using his leg, and throws the pieces to the ground]"
1813,8,9,Eric Cartman,"... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. [gives Kyle the finger, turns around, and walks away. Kyle watches him leave]"
1814,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. [Kyle turns, and the three remaining boys walk away.]"
1815,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell? [before them is a downtown that is shuttered and decayed. The asphalt is gone from the roads and eagles hover over the area. A window crashing makes them jump, and Butters appears around a corner, making weird noises.]"
1816,8,9,Stan Marsh,Butters? [more strange noises come from Butters' mouth]
1817,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,Butters? What the hell are you doing?
1818,8,9,Butters Stotch,Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. [this is true. Butters resumes his monster act.]
1819,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. [the boys turn and leave.]"
1820,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad? [looks around at all the stuff] Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!"
1821,8,9,Randy Marsh,Staaaan? [the boys hear him and rush over to the source of the noises]
1822,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad, oh my God!"
1823,8,9,Randy Marsh,Staan...
1824,8,9,Stan Marsh,"What? D-dad, are are you dying?"
1825,8,9,Randy Marsh,"No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night."
1826,8,9,Stan Marsh,But you-your face!
1827,8,9,Randy Marsh,Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one? [tears one off and sticks it to Stan's cheek] Here. It's a little turtle. [faints and falls over]
1828,8,9,Wall-Mart Manager,"Come in? [the boys and their parents, Butters' parents, Chef, Herbert Garrison and Mr. Slave all enter] Oh hello, fine shoppers."
1829,8,9,Chef,"Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore."
1830,8,9,Randy Marsh,"We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park."
1831,8,9,Wall-Mart Manager,"[begins to cackle nervously] What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave."
1832,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,But you run the Wall-Mart.
1833,8,9,Wall-Mart Manager,"Oh, you're wrong! [rises from his chair and moves towards the group] Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're workingbe at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides."
1834,8,9,Chef,They why don't you just quit?!
1835,8,9,Wall-Mart Manager,[whispering loudly] Not so loud! It can hear you.
1836,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You hate Wall-Mart, too? [rumbles emanate from the walls]"
1837,8,9,Wall-Mart Manager,"Aah! [nervously] I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right? [turns around and grabs some papers] Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun. [he writes as he talks, then shows the group what he wrote: ""NOT SAFE TO TALK HERE.""] Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? [writes some more and shows the group a second sheet: ""MEET ME OUT BACK IN 5 MINS."" He grimaces and tries to hint at them. The group leaves.]"
1838,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled."
1839,8,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! [circles his finger round his ear to indicate insanity. Seconds later the manager screams and flies out the window, only to end up hanging himself. The group looks on as the manager's pants drop off and poo follows shortly]"
1840,8,9,Eric Cartman,"[catching up with the other boys] Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!"
1841,8,9,Sharon Marsh,"Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them."
1842,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart."
1843,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore."
1844,8,9,Randy Marsh,"I know, I know! God! [pounds the table] Bleeeh! [Sharon joins them at table and the family begins eating]"
1845,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- [knocks over his glass of milk, which spills onto Shelly]"
1846,8,9,Shelly Marsh,"Oh, you stupid turd!"
1847,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!"
1848,8,9,Sharon Marsh,We do?
1849,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!"
1850,8,9,Stan Marsh,"But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-"
1851,8,9,Randy Marsh,STAN! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
1852,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Heeeey... [The Broflovskis approach and Randy looks] Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!"
1853,8,9,Gerald Broflovski,Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
1854,8,9,Randy Marsh,"[noticing other familiar faces] Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo! [the shoppers stop and look] Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!"
1855,8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Well what are you doing here, Randy?"
1856,8,9,Randy Marsh,I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
1857,8,9,Stan Marsh,Dad!
1858,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh all right, maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips. And butter. [pulls out a sheet and looks at it] And some new pliers."
1859,8,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here."
1860,8,9,Jimbo Kern,It's like some mystical evil force.
1861,8,9,Randy Marsh,Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
1862,8,9,Herbert Garrison,Let's burn it down!
1863,8,9,Chef,"No, no, no! Let's freeze it!"
1864,8,9,Stephen,I think it's best we try to reason with it.
1865,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility."
1866,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. [the people begin to sway back and forth]"
1867,8,9,All,"Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya, my Lord..."
1868,8,9,Eric Cartman,"You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?"
1869,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,[looking at Cartman] It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
1870,8,9,Eric Cartman,"No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it."
1871,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, our town is going to be better without the- [sounds of construction are heard. Kyle turns to look. ] What the?"
1872,8,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh, awesome! [rushes towards Wall-Mart]"
1873,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"How... How did this happen? [the other boys make their way to the store, then look around at the restored store, which is running as if nothing had happened the night before. Kyle's parents are shopping there, and they run into the boys.] Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?"
1874,8,9,Gerald Broflovski,"We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it."
1875,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Can I help you? [the boys turn around and see the man is Randy, and the jump back in fright]"
1876,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad, what are you doing?!"
1877,8,9,Randy Marsh,You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
1878,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you're a geologist!"
1879,8,9,Randy Marsh,"I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend."
1880,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! Hey! [the driver looks at them] Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
1881,8,9,Crane Driver,"Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters."
1882,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!
1883,8,9,Crane Driver,You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.
1884,8,9,Stan Marsh,Where are they?
1885,8,9,Crane Driver,"Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. [drives away]"
1886,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!"
1887,8,9,Eric Cartman,"[Inside the store] Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents? [freezes in place and hears sounds] Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again? [turns a little angry] Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. [with a look of determination, he leaves the store.]"
1888,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please."
1889,8,9,Eric Cartman,[rushing up to join them] Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
1890,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
1891,8,9,Eric Cartman,Nuh-uh.
1892,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, ""Haha! I was working for Wall-Mart all along!"" or something."
1893,8,9,Eric Cartman,"I am not, Kyle!"
1894,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. [he and Kenny head for the doors]"
1895,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine. Come on, fatass! [leaves to catch up with Stan.]"
1896,8,9,Eric Cartman,[pulls out a knife from his back pocket] Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
1897,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes out to face Cartman] I heard that!
1898,8,9,Eric Cartman,You heard what?
1899,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
1900,8,9,Eric Cartman,That's not what I said! [Stan comes out to see what's going on]
1901,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, come on!"
1902,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
1903,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we have to go!"
1904,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,God-damnit! [turns and heads towards Stan]
1905,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!"
1906,8,9,Eric Cartman,[to himself] Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
1907,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Goddamn, that took a long time."
1908,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
1909,8,9,Eric Cartman,[drawing out the syllables] I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
1910,8,9,Wall-Mart Receptionist,Can I help you?
1911,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
1912,8,9,Wall-Mart Receptionist,"Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it."
1913,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,We want to talk to who's in charge.
1914,8,9,Wall-Mart Receptionist,In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators.
1915,8,9,Stan Marsh,Where's he?
1916,8,9,Harvey Brown,"We... invented the Wall-Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low. [defeated, buries his face in his left hand] We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control."
1917,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,So how do we stop it?
1918,8,9,Harvey Brown,[raises his head] You don't stop it.
1919,8,9,Stan Marsh,There has to be a way!
1920,8,9,Harvey Brown,"There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall-Mart in your town! ...Unless... of course, you can find and destroy its heart."
1921,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,The heart of Wall-Mart?
1922,8,9,Eric Cartman,"Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?"
1923,8,9,Harvey Brown,"Every Wall-Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!"
1924,8,9,Eric Cartman,"You speak too much, sir!"
1925,8,9,Stan Marsh,Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
1926,8,9,Harvey Brown,"Because the Wall-Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all."
1927,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,All right. C'mon you guys. We have to get back home. [they drop down and leave the room]
1928,8,9,Harvey Brown,"[shakes his head] It won't work, don't you understand?! It isn't gonna stop until there's nothing but Wall-Mart left! Jesus, what did we do?! What did we do?! [the boys are at the doors, about to leave. Mr. Brown spins around on his stool] Boys! [the boys turn and see him take a gun to his head] Tell the world... I'm sorry! [the boys are alarmed]"
1929,8,9,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, don't! [Mr. Brown shoots himself through the temple and falls over on his left side, dead. Seconds later he craps through his pants, leaving a hole in them and a fallen bar stool nearby. A few moments of shock, and then Cartman cracks up]"
1930,8,9,Eric Cartman,"[pointing to Kyle] That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!"
1931,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it."
1932,8,9,Eric Cartman,"[rushes in and blocks their path. holding a dagger] I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!"
1933,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,I knew you were!
1934,8,9,Eric Cartman,"No, you didn't."
1935,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!"
1936,8,9,Eric Cartman,"No, you didn't."
1937,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, I did!"
1938,8,9,Eric Cartman,"No, you didn't."
1939,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, I did!"
1940,8,9,Eric Cartman,"No, you didn't."
1941,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, I did!"
1942,8,9,Eric Cartman,"No, you didn't."
1943,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes. I did! [a few more rounds of this and they stand head to head, silent]"
1944,8,9,Eric Cartman,"...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-"
1945,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,[interrupting] -slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I- [Cartman babbles loudly to drown him out] -and I told you that-
1946,8,9,Eric Cartman,"[plugs his ears] I can't hear you! Lalalalalala! [once he's sure Kyle is quiet, he unplugs his ears and pulls out his dagger] I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! [holds out the dagger, ready for battle.]"
1947,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[he and Stan walk around Cartman] We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! [Kenny does as told]"
1948,8,9,Eric Cartman,"Very well, Kenny! Let us battle! [Kenny begins delivering blows at Cartman] Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off."
1949,8,9,Marvin Marsh,Welcome to Wall-Mart.
1950,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Save it, Grandpa!"
1951,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"We've gotta find the television department. [the lights flicker and turn off. Randy leaps into view in front of the boys, carrying an ax. Stan and Kyle scream]"
1952,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine."
1953,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart."
1954,8,9,Randy Marsh,Shhhhh! What are you talking about?
1955,8,9,Stan Marsh,One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
1956,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Television department... All right, come on, let's go! [they move down the aisle for some distance. Randy stops and jumps] Oh my God!"
1957,8,9,Stan Marsh,What?!
1958,8,9,Randy Marsh,Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
1959,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! [the three make their way to the back, but Randy can't help but look at all the bargains]"
1960,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! [they come across a bunch of bikes priced at $29.99. They scream and run off. The boys run down another aisle, but Randy isn't with them.]"
1961,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,I think I see the television department in the back!
1962,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?! [looks around, then turns to his right. Kyle turns to his left. Both boys see Randy] Dad!"
1963,8,9,Randy Marsh,The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!
1964,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Dad!"
1965,8,9,Randy Marsh,"I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!"
1966,8,9,Stan Marsh,"No, dad! We need your keys!"
1967,8,9,Randy Marsh,"This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on! [tosses the keys to Stan, who catches them] The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! [the boys leave the aisle]"
1968,8,9,Stan Marsh,[passing the candy display] There! The television department!
1969,8,9,Wall Mart,"Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far. [the boys approach him]"
1970,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,Who are you?
1971,8,9,Wall Mart,I am... Wall-Mart. [the boys look at each other]
1972,8,9,Stan Marsh,You?
1973,8,9,Wall Mart,I've taken this form in order to talk to you. But I can take many forms. [dons a brimmed hat] Does this suit you better? Or perhaps you prefer this form? [takes off the hat and puts on a robe] I can take whichever form I like. [removes the robe and puts on a pirate hat and black patch over his left eye.]
1974,8,9,Stan Marsh,We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
1975,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where's the heart?
1976,8,9,Wall Mart,"To find the heart of Wall-Mart, one must first ask oneself, ""Who is it that asked the question?"" [the boys look at each other again]"
1977,8,9,Stan Marsh,Me. I'm asking the question.
1978,8,9,Wall Mart,"Ah, yes, but who are you?"
1979,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?"
1980,8,9,Wall Mart,"Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!"
1981,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"The question is, ""Where is the heart?"""
1982,8,9,Wall Mart,"Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall-Mart? It lies beyond that plasma-screen television. [the boys look to their right and walk over. The open a small door marked ""EMPLOYEES ONLY"" and they open it. A rectangular mirror is behind it.]"
1983,8,9,Stan Marsh,It's a mirror.
1984,8,9,Wall Mart,"Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take may forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire!"
1985,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. [the boys turn and face the mirror again, and Kyle takes a black mallet to it. It shatters.]"
1986,8,9,Wall Mart,"Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?! [the building begins to rumble] Now you shall see my true form! [Removes his mustache and begins to march around with vigor and laughing harshly] Now you see me as I truly am!"
1987,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,"We'd better get out of here. [outside, Cartman and Kenny stop wrestling and witness the Wall-Mart rumbling and there's lighting flying around it. Inside, Stan and Kyle make their way to the front doors]"
1988,8,9,Chef,[panicking] Get out! It's gonna blow! [the shoppers pay heed]
1989,8,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!"
1990,8,9,Randy Marsh,"Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!"
1991,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out NOW! [the shoppers and employees now bolt for the doors and run out as an M in Mart falls down.]
1992,8,9,Herbert Garrison,"[proudly] Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall-Mart! [the crowd cheers]"
1993,8,9,Gerald Broflovski,"How did you do it, Kyle?"
1994,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
1995,8,9,Chef,"We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! [nearby, a soldier sits at the ready to send out the news on a telegraph]"
1996,8,9,Randy Marsh,Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
1997,8,9,Kyle Broflovski,Duh.
1998,8,9,Randy Marsh,"You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?"
1999,8,9,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! [the crowd approves and marches down the street]
2000,8,9,Crowd,"...Oh Lord, Kumbaya."
2001,8,9,Randy Marsh,"All right, let's not make that mistake again."
2002,8,9,Herbert Garrison,"Yeah, lets all shop over at True Value!"
2003,8,9,Crowd,Let's go! Yeah! [the crowd moves to the store as one]

2007,8,11,Announcer,"This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, Super School News. The news made for students, by students."
2008,8,11,Jimmy Valmer,Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
2009,8,11,Eric Cartman,And I'm Rick Cartman.
2010,8,11,Jimmy Valmer,The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
2011,8,11,Eric Cartman,"Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh."
2012,8,11,Stan Marsh,"Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?"
2013,8,11,Eric Cartman,"[serious pose] ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?"
2014,8,11,Butters Stotch,"Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse."
2015,8,11,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters, keep your eyes open."
2016,8,11,Butters Stotch,[over a speaker] Will do.
2017,8,11,Jimmy Valmer,More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
2018,8,11,Token Black,"[in front of a weather map] Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?"
2019,8,11,Eric Cartman,"Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right."
2020,8,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[at a small desk, for Sports] Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit."
2021,8,11,Eric Cartman,Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
2022,8,11,Jimmy Valmer,And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- [lilts] Ehehehehe [normal] El-Elementary.
2023,8,11,Stan Marsh,[returning from the kitchen to serve as cameraman] And we're... cut! [turns off the camera]
2024,8,11,Eric Cartman,"All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. [the reporters gather in studio]"
2025,8,11,Butters Stotch,"Boy, that was a great episode!"
2026,8,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet."
2027,8,11,Mr Meryl,"[enters the studio] Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show."
2028,8,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
2029,8,11,Jimmy Valmer,"For God's sake,why Mr. M-M-Meryl?!"
2030,8,11,Mr Meryl,"Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week."
2031,8,11,Eric Cartman,How many students is that?
2032,8,11,Mr Meryl,"Four. [holds up four fingers] Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57!"
2033,8,11,Stan Marsh,...Craig's show??
2034,8,11,Eric Cartman,What is that butthole doing now?!
2035,8,11,Mr Meryl,"Oh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens. [pops a VHS tape into the player and the video starts]"
2036,8,11,Craig Tucker,"[on tape, as the name of the show is displayed] Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens. [the video goes on to show close-ups of dogs and cats.]"
2037,8,11,Stan Marsh,But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
2038,8,11,Mr Meryl,"It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than your show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh-sorry, kids. [walks between and past them]"
2039,8,11,Jimmy Valmer,"[stopping Mr. Meryl] But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much."
2040,8,11,Mr Meryl,"Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!"
2041,8,11,Eric Cartman,"Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing."
2042,8,11,Mr Meryl,"I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay. [walks off]"
2043,8,11,Eric Cartman,...You're gay!
2044,8,11,Butters Stotch,[his head resting on his right hand] Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
2045,8,11,Stan Marsh,Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
2046,8,11,Whistlin Willy,"[approaches the table] Hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'? [begins to whistle]"
2047,8,11,Eric Cartman,"Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood."
2048,8,11,Whistlin Willy,"[enthusiastically] If you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle. [whistles] Come on! [whistles some more, then stops. The boys whistle back, but slowly and flatly] There you go! [sets the pizza down on the table and leaves]"
2049,8,11,Eric Cartman,"[softly] God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park."
2050,8,11,Stan Marsh,"[look at Cartman, but notices someone else] Hey, look, Craig just walked in. [Craig enters to cheers from the other kids in the restaurant and waves back to them. Several kids take pictures of Craig]"
2051,8,11,Bradley,Yeah!
2052,8,11,Kid 1,"Hey look, it's Craig!"
2053,8,11,Kevin,"Hey, Craig, over here!"
2054,8,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Geez, all that from a stupid video show."
2055,8,11,Craig Tucker,[sees the other boys and addresses them] Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
2056,8,11,Eric Cartman,"Go play with yourself, Craig."
2057,8,11,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows."
2058,8,11,Stan Marsh,"Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! [holds up a fist with thumb and index finger just a centimeter apart]"
2059,8,11,Craig Tucker,[throws the gesture back at Stan] This much more than you had!
2060,8,11,Craig Tucker,"Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! [the other kids cheer and the waiter opens the lounge. The kids pour into place, including Kenny.]"
2061,8,11,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
2062,8,11,Eric Cartman,"[catches up to Kenny] Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!"
2063,8,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)"
2064,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!"
2065,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,We're gonna miss what?
2066,8,12,Bebe Stevens,Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
2067,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,Who's Paris Hilton?
2068,8,12,Red,"""Who's Paris Hilton?"""
2069,8,12,Annie Knitts,You don't know?
2070,8,12,Announcer,"[someone takes a picture as he approaches the mic.] Hello, everyone! The Guess Clothing Company is pleased to have as its new spokesperson model, a woman all you young ones can look up to, Ms. Paris Hilton. [she appears and flashbulbs go off amid squeals from females in the crowd. She then lifts her bra and shows off her breasts]"
2071,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!"
2072,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,I don't get it. What's she do?
2073,8,12,Annie Knitts,She's super-rich!
2074,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,...But what does she do?
2075,8,12,Red,She's totally spoiled and snobby.
2076,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,[annoyed] What does she do?!
2077,8,12,Man,[walks by and overhears] She's a whore. [takes his camera and snaps a few pictures]
2078,8,12,Paris Hilton,"[her left eyelid hangs heavy] Hey everyone. Sorry if I'm a little spent. I did a whole lot of partying last night with a LOT of different guys. [coughs semen onto her left fist] Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Gouth Dark to announce the opening of my brand new store! A store where girls can buy everything they need to be just like me! Stupid Spoiled Whore! [the red curtain drops to reveal the store. The crowd cheers] Have fun, girls. And remember to party, and be super-lame to everybody. G'Bye! [steps aside and off-stage. An assistant awaits with water and a tote bag, which has a Chihuahua in it. She holds out a bottle of water] Give me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink! [vomits out feces, then drinks from the bottle. The assistant arms her with the tote bag] Where's my dog?! [walks off]"
2079,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls."
2080,8,12,Red,"[walks up to a display case] Hey, check it out: the new Paris Hilton perfume, Skanque. [grins and holds a heart-shaped bottle with the name on it]"
2081,8,12,Announcer,Skanque.
2082,8,12,Annie Knitts,"[carrying some clothes] Oh yeah, let's get lots of that!"
2083,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?"
2084,8,12,Red,"It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're all stupid spoiled whores!"
2085,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
2086,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"[now with two armloads of clothes] Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!"
2087,8,12,Annie Knitts,"Wow, you really sound like a dumb brat, Bebe."
2088,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Thanks, Annie! [She, Annie, and Red walk away, and Wendy remains stunned]"
2089,8,12,Paris Hilton,"[quickly arrives and enters the limo] God, get me out of this hick town! What a bunch of rednecks! [the driver closes the door, starts up the limo, and drives off. Inside, she picks up her Chihuahua and starts talking to it, caressing it] Everybody's so fucking lame. Except for you, my little Tinkerbell. You love my vewy much, don't you? How much you wuv me? I'm gonna dress you up like a bunny, and then I'm gonna dress you up like a little princess. You're mine forever! [her cellphone rings and she answers it, releasing Tinkerbell.] Whatever! Oh, hey, Kasey. Oh, another stupid store opening at some lame cowboy town. [Tinkerbell jumps down from the seat and walks away dejected] Oh, it's so fucking stupid, this whole town stinks like cows. [Tinkerbell is up on the divider and looks down] I can't wait to get out of here! Grody!"
2090,8,12,Paris Hilton,"They have the lamest stores, too. [... walks over to the driver and digs around his right coat pocket ...] I'm gonna go to Rome for the weekend, I think. I dunno, Rome or Tokyo, either way it'll be totally boring. [... and digs out a small gun from the pocket.] Stupid. [coughs some semen onto her left hand] Hagh. [Tinkerbell carries the gun back to the back seat...] I need to get wasted. I haven't had a drink in like fourteen minutes. Why is everybody so stupid anyway? [... and sets the gun down long enough to put the barrel against its chin. Tinkerbell then tries to set the gun off with her right hind leg. That doesn't work, so she stands the gun up on its butt and tries again] I flashed all these hicks with my boobs; you should've seen the look on their faces! Stupid redneck idiots!"
2091,8,12,Paris Hilton,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
2092,8,12,Paris Hilton's Chauffeur,Oh dear...
2093,8,12,Paris Hilton,Another dog killed itself!
2094,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey Jessie [the blonde], Hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange."
2095,8,12,Jessie,"Sure, Wendy. We were just trying to think of something to do."
2096,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?"
2097,8,12,Jessie,"Nah, that sounds really dull."
2098,8,12,Kal,"Hey, I know! Let's make a videotape of us having sex with boys! [Jessie likes the idea]"
2099,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,What?!
2100,8,12,Kal,"I just got [brings out a box] the Stupid Spoiled Whore video playset! [the set comes from Letcher Price and ""Makes you a whore and so much more!""]"
2101,8,12,Singers,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset!
2102,8,12,Kal,You can make videos that get out on the Internet!
2103,8,12,Jessie,Yeah! [Kal puts on some makeup as Jessie looks on]
2104,8,12,Singers,Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Show the whole world what a slut you are!
2105,8,12,Announcer,"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset comes with video camera, night-vision filter, play money, cellphone, and sixteen hits of ecstasy. [nine hits are shown] [The playset box is shown again, then Kal is shown on the cellphone]"
2106,8,12,Singers,"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Let everyone see your coo-ooch!

[The playset box is shown again, then Kal is shown on the cellphone]"
2107,8,12,Kal,I'm pretending to be calling my friends on the cellphone while my man waits for more sex!
2108,8,12,Jessie,"You're a Stupid Spoiled Whore. [Wendy just turns right and walks away.] Where are you goin', Wendy?"
2109,8,12,Paris Hilton,Bwaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaa!
2110,8,12,Paris Hilton's Chauffeur,"All right, Ms. Hilton, we'll find you another dog."
2111,8,12,Paris Hilton,[throws a tantrum] Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
2112,8,12,Driver,"There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?"
2113,8,12,Paris Hilton,"Woooooooooohooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo... [notices something outside] Wait! Wait, stop the car! [the limo proceeds] Stop the car, you fucking moron! [the limo stops] Look at how cuuute. I want that! I want that!"
2114,8,12,Butters Stotch,"[playing with some apples on a checkerboard blanket on the front lawn] 
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too."
2115,8,12,Paris Hilton,It's adorable! [exits the limo and closes the door]
2116,8,12,Butters Stotch,"Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!

 [Paris approaches him]"
2117,8,12,Paris Hilton,"Look at his wittle puff ball! [Butters is surprised] I'm gonna feed you, and take care of you, and call you Mr. Biggles! [kneels down and hugs him]"
2118,8,12,Butters Stotch,My name's Butters.
2119,8,12,Paris Hilton,"Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car. [the driver appears] I want to find a bear costume for him. Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?"
2120,8,12,Paris Hilton's Chauffeur,"Paris, I believe this is somebody's child."
2121,8,12,Paris Hilton,I want it!
2122,8,12,Paris Hilton's Chauffeur,I don't think you can actually-
2123,8,12,Paris Hilton,I want it! I want it! [rocks back and forth]
2124,8,12,Paris Hilton's Chauffeur,"All right, all right, come on- come on, young man."
2125,8,12,Butters Stotch,"Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, ""never get into a car with a stranger."""
2126,8,12,Paris Hilton,Well did they say anything about limousines? [Butters thinks about it. An image of his parents appears]
2127,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine."
2128,8,12,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right."
2129,8,12,Paris Hilton,"[happily] Get in the limo, Mr. Biggles! We're gonna have a bear costume made for you!"
2130,8,12,Announcer,"And now, back to The Price is Right! [Wendy sighs]"
2131,8,12,Dad,"Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?"
2132,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society."
2133,8,12,Dad,Oh?
2134,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon."
2135,8,12,Dad,...Gosh.
2136,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations."
2137,8,12,Dad,"Well, get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? [Wendy doesn't answer. Instead, she turns away and walks off slowly, and her parents go back to eating chips]"
2138,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"[spins around and walks back] Dad, there's a new store at the mall called ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!"
2139,8,12,Dad,"[suddenly angered] What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady!"
2140,8,12,Mr Testaburger,"Oh my God! Well this place is-! Oh my God! [approaches a line of girls and their mothers.] Mrs. Knitts, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?!"
2141,8,12,Mrs Knitts,"[giggles] It's what's in right now. I, I can't have my little girl be the only one not in a trend; she'll be unpopular."
2142,8,12,Mr Testaburger,Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?! [Bebe and her mom now pay attention] But these are our girls!
2143,8,12,Mrs Stevens,"I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's normal, but if a woman wants to be one, it's wrong. [the other females murmur in agreement]"
2144,8,12,Woman 1,"Yeah, when a man pees standing up, it's normal, but when a woman does it, it's weird."
2145,8,12,Females,Yeah! Right!
2146,8,12,Woman 2,"Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's straaange."
2147,8,12,Females,Yeah! Right! It isn't fair!
2148,8,12,Teen Girl 1,"All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts from now on, so you can just get used to it."
2149,8,12,Teen Girl 2,"[rubs her ass up against Mr. Testaburger] Yeah. Will you buy me that purse I want over there? I'll do anything, 'cause I'm a whore."
2150,8,12,Mr Testaburger,"[more amenable now] Oh, uh sure I can buy a purse."
2151,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,Dad!
2152,8,12,Mr Testaburger,"Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard. [enjoying the affection] Oh yeah. I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!"
2153,8,12,Females,Hooray!
2154,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!"
2155,8,12,Butters Stotch,"[dressed in a bear cub outfit] Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this."
2156,8,12,Stephen Stotch,Your girlfriend?
2157,8,12,Paris Hilton,"[enters the scene] There you are, Mr. Biggles! [picks Butters up and hugs him] Aw, I thought I'd lost you! [caresses him] Promise you'll never leave me. [his parents are stunned]"
2158,8,12,Linda Stotch,"Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton? You are grounded, mister!"
2159,8,12,Butters Stotch,I'm sorry.
2160,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"[turns his wife around] Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?"
2161,8,12,Linda Stotch,"Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!"
2162,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son! [they turn around]"
2163,8,12,Linda Stotch,"Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? [Paris coughs some semen onto her left hand and rubs it against the rug]"
2164,8,12,Paris Hilton,With schnapps and Scotch. [coughs some more semen onto her hand]
2165,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels."
2166,8,12,Paris Hilton,"I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me."
2167,8,12,Linda Stotch,[stunned again] With you where?
2168,8,12,Paris Hilton,"To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much?"
2169,8,12,Linda Stotch,How much? For Butters?
2170,8,12,Stephen Stotch,Butters is our son. He's not for sale.
2171,8,12,Paris Hilton,I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it. [Butters is afraid. Chris spits out his cocoa and puts down his cup]
2172,8,12,Stephen Stotch,Excuse me?!
2173,8,12,Paris Hilton,I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it! [Chris spits out his cocoa. Linda does so as well. Paris whips out a checkbook and pen] I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now.
2174,8,12,Linda Stotch,"Chris, is she serious?"
2175,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk."
2176,8,12,Butters Stotch,"[while Paris writes out a check] Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton."
2177,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, right now!"
2178,8,12,Linda Stotch,We aren't honestly considering this?
2179,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it."
2180,8,12,Linda Stotch,But he's our son!
2181,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family."
2182,8,12,Linda Stotch,The rest of the f- you do mean us?
2183,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, us, the rest of the family."
2184,8,12,Paris Hilton,"What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much. [falls backward upon the bad] Oh my God, I'm so wasted! [her genitals are exposed] The room's all spinny. I'm... totally passing out. [she falls silent. Butters looks around, then reaches over with his left hand and touches her vagina a few times]"
2185,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight."
2186,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party."
2187,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,I'm a stupid spoiled whore. [her dress is relaxed: blue jeans and turquoise tank top with one strap over the right shoulder. The girls laugh at her reply]
2188,8,12,Annie Knitts,"Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff!"
2189,8,12,Red,"Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!"
2190,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!"
2191,8,12,Red,"You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle, and Two Minutes In The Closet, and do ketamine."
2192,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,That's okay.
2193,8,12,Annie Knitts,"Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is?"
2194,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,Yes.
2195,8,12,Annie Knitts,See? You are too smart.
2196,8,12,Red,Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.
2197,8,12,Bebe Stevens,Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
2198,8,12,Various Teen Girls,"Yeah. [Wendy turns around and walks off sadly. The others laugh at her, then move on to other topics]"
2199,8,12,Red,"Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party."
2200,8,12,Sally Turner,"Oooo, look, here comes Clyde."
2201,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. [Clyde walks by, wondering what these girls are on about]"
2202,8,12,Millie Larsen,"Mmm, I'd like a piece of that!"
2203,8,12,Red,I wanna do him.
2204,8,12,Annie Knitts,"Oh, yeah. Here comes Kyle. [Cartman, still at his locker, looks over. Kyle passes by]"
2205,8,12,Sally Turner,"Mmm, talk to me, kosher boy. [Cartman turns around to see what the girls see]"
2206,8,12,Millie Larsen,I'd like to twizel his pixie stick.
2207,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Party at my house tonight, Kyle."
2208,8,12,Annie Knitts,Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way. [Tweek and Jason walk by]
2209,8,12,Red,"Yeah, they're invited too."
2210,8,12,Sally Turner,"Jason has a huge bulge. You're gonna get it, boys."
2211,8,12,Bebe Stevens,Now here's what I'm talking about. [Token appears and walks by] A little midnight blue!
2212,8,12,Millie Larsen,"Yeah, I'd like to wax his crankshaft!"
2213,8,12,Annie Knitts,"Be at Bebe's house, tonight, at seven! [Cartman clears his throat, closes his locker, and walks past the girls. Not one of them says a thing.]"
2214,8,12,Sally Turner,"Look, here comes Kevin. [Kevin appears and walks by]"
2215,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Hey Kevin, party at my house."
2216,8,12,Millie Larsen,I'd like to gargle his marbles.
2217,8,12,Red,"Yeah, you said it. [Cartman runs back along the hall in such a way that the girls don't notice]"
2218,8,12,Sally Turner,"See you there, Kev. [Cartman tries again, and the girls notice.]"
2219,8,12,Eric Cartman,"""Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure."" [the girls say nothing. Cartman stops, gets angry, and walks back to the first girl he saw, then flips each one of them off. He flips Red off with both hands.] Fuck you Millie, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! [leaves.]"
2220,8,12,Butters Stotch,"Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. [upon hearing a knock on the door, he gasps and stops probing Paris]"
2221,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton."
2222,8,12,Paris Hilton,[awakens and sits up] Eugh. Where am I? Ew! This room's all middle-class and small!
2223,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars. [Butters smiles] It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front."
2224,8,12,Butters Stotch,Oh hamburgers!
2225,8,12,Paris Hilton,"Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!"
2226,8,12,Butters Stotch,"[jumps off the bed and runs to Linda] Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! [the parents look at each other]"
2227,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay."
2228,8,12,Butters Stotch,"Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??"
2229,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"It's called ""working"" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!"
2230,8,12,Butters Stotch,Y-yes sir! [rushes out of the room] I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
2231,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"[to Linda] That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start? [they both grin]"
2232,8,12,Millie Larsen,"[stands next to the closet while a crowd of girls looks on] Okay, that's two minutes. You can come out, Clyde, Bab. [the door opens and Bab comes out grinning] How was he, Bab?"
2233,8,12,Bab,"[winks at Clyde] We had a great time, didn't we Clyde?"
2234,8,12,Clyde Donovan,"[walks out crying with his hands rubbing his butt] Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. [a knock is heard at the front door and Red goes to answer it.]"
2235,8,12,Eric Cartman,"[dressed very casually, with hair slightly unkempt] Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party."
2236,8,12,Red,[not fooled] Yeah? Who invited you?
2237,8,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me."
2238,8,12,Red,Kelly who?
2239,8,12,Eric Cartman,Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
2240,8,12,Red,[looks over her shoulder and calls out] Kelly Rutherfordmenskin?
2241,8,12,Kelly Rutherfordmenskin,[approaches the door] Yeah?
2242,8,12,Red,Did you invite him?
2243,8,12,Kelly Menskin,No! [goes back inside. Red closes the door on Cartman]
2244,8,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?"
2245,8,12,Red,[turns around and calls out] Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
2246,8,12,Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter,[sharing a wading pool with Token and Heidi] What? [Red glares at Cartman]
2247,8,12,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] Oh, Goddammit!"
2248,8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right?"
2249,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"No, I need help."
2250,8,12,Herbert Garrison,F-from from me?
2251,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend."
2252,8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Well sure, come on in. Mr. Slave is right over here. [the camera follows them over to Mr. Slave, who's dangling from the ceiling like a marionette. He's moaning in pleasure]"
2253,8,12,Mr Slave,"Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!"
2254,8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you."
2255,8,12,Mr Slave,"Oh, Hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?"
2256,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you"
2257,8,12,Herbert Garrison,"...Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa."
2258,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know."
2259,8,12,Mr Slave,Thank you sweetie.
2260,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,Can you teach me your secret fast?
2261,8,12,Mr Slave,"Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember. [a shot of the toddler Slave crawling around on a bed] Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things."
2262,8,12,Little Slave,"Mommy, I think I have a fever. Can you take my temperature? [his mom approaches and sticks a thermometer up his butt] Oooo, Jesus Christ. [grins]"
2263,8,12,Mr Slave,"As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough."
2264,8,12,Boy Slave,"[sees a football practice and fakes a call] Hey, there's that queer kid. Let's tackle him! [holds out his arms and waits for the tackle]"
2265,8,12,Kid,"Hey yeah, tackle the queer kid! [the players gang up on him. He seems to love the punishment] We'll show you, queer!"
2266,8,12,Boy Slave,Oooooooooooh! Oooooooooooh! Jesus Christ!
2267,8,12,Mr Slave,"So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?"
2268,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
2269,8,12,Mr Slave,"A what?! For God's sake, where?!"
2270,8,12,Butters Stotch,"You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.

 [a blue car pulls up alongside and stops]"
2271,8,12,Man,"Look at that. A bear, mining for coal."
2272,8,12,Woman,"Huh, I never. [the car moves on. Butters' parents, Paris, and her driver approach him]"
2273,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?"
2274,8,12,Butters Stotch,"Well, no, not quite."
2275,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, well, too bad. [shows off the check] Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her."
2276,8,12,Butters Stotch,"[throws away his shovel] Ah, shucks! [moments later he follows Paris into the limo]"
2277,8,12,Linda Stotch,"Bye, sweetie, we love you!"
2278,8,12,Paris Hilton,Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my new pet before anything happens. [snaps a picture]
2279,8,12,Butters Stotch,"Before what happens? [gets no answer, so looks around and sees her ""MY PETS"" photo album. He picks it up and leafs through it]"
2280,8,12,Butters Stotch,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! [throws the book away, gets out of the limo as fast as he can and runs away.]"
2281,8,12,Paris Hilton,"[exits the limo] Mr. Biggles! Mr. Biggles, come back! [Butters' parents approach] You'd better help me find him! No Mr. Biggles, no money! [takes away the check]"
2282,8,12,Chris,"Oh that trouble making son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!"
2283,8,12,Mr Slave,"Oh Jesus! [turns on the light] Kids, kids!"
2284,8,12,Annie Knitts,"Ew, party foul!"
2285,8,12,Red,Shut off the light.
2286,8,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, thank God."
2287,8,12,Mr Slave,"Girls, what on earth are you doing?"
2288,8,12,Bebe Stevens,We're being stupid spoiled whores. [grins]
2289,8,12,Butters Stotch,[rushes in] H-help! You've gotta hide me! [opens the closet door and enters] Don't tell her I'm in here! [closes the door]
2290,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!"
2291,8,12,Mr Slave,"Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!"
2292,8,12,Paris Hilton,[approaches the house and enters] Mr. Biggles!
2293,8,12,Mr Slave,"[unaware] Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife!"
2294,8,12,Paris Hilton,Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?!
2295,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!"
2296,8,12,Butters Stotch,"[bolts out of the closet] HAAAAH! [Bab looks out from the closet, grinning]"
2297,8,12,Mr Slave,"Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing."
2298,8,12,Paris Hilton,What isn't great about it? What's more to life than partying?
2299,8,12,Mr Slave,"Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life."
2300,8,12,Paris Hilton,"You don't even know what partying is, loser. [brushes him off]"
2301,8,12,Mr Slave,"Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?"
2302,8,12,Paris Hilton,"Oh I went there. I went there, took some pictures, and flew back already."
2303,8,12,Various Teen Girls,Ooooo!
2304,8,12,Annie Knitts,"Wow, what a bitch. [smiles]"
2305,8,12,Mr Slave,"Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some ""partying"" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great."
2306,8,12,Paris Hilton,Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!
2307,8,12,Various Teen Girls,Ooooo!
2308,8,12,Men,[popping up out of nowhere] Whore-off! Whore-off!
2309,8,12,Official,"Ah, testing? Hello? [taps the mic a few times] Okay uh, welcome everyone. Uh, the South Park Chamber of Commerce is pleased to bring you the first annual ""Who Is The Biggest Whore"" showdown. [the crowd cheers]"
2310,8,12,Bebe Stevens,Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
2311,8,12,Red,Paris is gonna rock his world.
2312,8,12,Official,"Ah, I'm... not quite sure how we... start this competition off, but uh-"
2313,8,12,Paris Hilton,[gets off her chair and walks over to the mic] I'll show ya how we start it off. [the music starts and she kisses him hard and grabbing his crotch]
2314,8,12,Crowd,"Ohhh! [the girls are grinning, Wendy looks at the girls' reactions. Paris then has five men on stage with her, and one of them is licking her leg. Mr. Slave simply observes]"
2315,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"[approaches Stan and friends, and Mr. Garrison] What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there."
2316,8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Give him time, Wendy. Give him time. [cheers him on softly] Come on, Mr. Slave."
2317,8,12,Paris Hilton,[throws the men off] Back off! None of you losers are enough for me! [whips out a pineapple from behind her back and stuffs it up her vagina] Eeeaaagh. Oh yeah. Aaaargh. [some gasps] Tada! [the crowd cheers and fireworks go off]
2318,8,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, no she di'int. [the crowd continues cheering]"
2319,8,12,Mr Slave,"[dusts himself off and coughs] Jesus. [takes off his pants and takes a running leap towards Paris. He lands on her head and proceeds to swallow her up through his ass, with each swallow accompanied by a grunt. The first swallow takes her head; the second, her chest; the third, her abdomen and lower back; and the fourth takes the rest of her body.] Ohoho, Jesus. [the girls are stunned at what they just saw. The adults, the boys, and Wendy all cheer]"
2320,8,12,Herbert Garrison,"Now, that's a whore! [Stan and friends are still stunned. Mr. Slave goes back to his chair and puts on his pants]"
2321,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all."
2322,8,12,Mr Slave,"People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore. [the crowd falls silent] Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the- [feels something in his stomach] ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people."
2323,8,12,Mr Stevens,"The homosexual is right. From now on, Bebe, you're going to dress like a little girl. [the crowd disperses and the girls walk up to Wendy]"
2324,8,12,Bebe Stevens,"Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled."
2325,8,12,Red,"Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore."
2326,8,12,Wendy Testaburger,"That's okay, you guys. [Butters and his family are shown next]"
2327,8,12,Stephen Stotch,"So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!"
2328,8,12,Butters Stotch,[turns right and walks away] I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
2329,8,12,Stephen Stotch,You're a grounded old bear.
2330,8,12,Paris Hilton,"Oh my God, it's so gross! Let me out of here! [a light comes on in front of her - it's the Frog King] What the fuck is that?"
2331,8,12,Frog King,"Paris, you must find the way out of this place or you'll surely die."
2332,8,12,Paris Hilton,What?
2333,8,12,Frog King,"Make your way to the small intestine. There you will meet the Sparrow Prince, who can guide you to Catatafish. Now go, Paris Hilton. Make haste! [disappears]"
2334,8,12,Singers,"[End of Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset. Some singers sing the following song as Paris begins her journey:]
A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward Paris Hilton or you will soon be dead.
The road ahead is filled with danger and fright
But push onward, Paris Hilton, with all of your might.
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Stupid whore!"
2335,8,13,Clyde Donovan,"I don't know, that looks pretty high up."
2336,8,13,Butters Stotch,Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
2337,8,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. [Cartman is shown at the edge of the roof wearing wings made from cardboard]"
2338,8,13,Eric Cartman,"This is gonna be totally cool, you guys."
2339,8,13,Stan Marsh,It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
2340,8,13,Eric Cartman,"[assessing the situation] ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here."
2341,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,[arrives in time to see Cartman's attempt] What's going on?
2342,8,13,Stan Marsh,Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. [Kyle looks up to see what the others see. Cartman looks down]
2343,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Do it! Do it!
2344,8,13,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna!
2345,8,13,Craig,I wouldn't if I were you.
2346,8,13,Token Black,Those wings don't look very strong.
2347,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!"
2348,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, here we go. [steps forward and gets ready to launch himself] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-"
2349,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Awww, go on and do it already!"
2350,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations."
2351,8,13,Stan Marsh,[to Kenny] He's not gonna do it.
2352,8,13,Eric Cartman,"And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! [he flaps his cardboard wings a few times to get some lift, then jumps off the roof. He heads straight for the ground and lands on his face with a grunt. All the boys are shocked and stand there frozen for several seconds. Stan is the first to leave, then Kyle, then the rest of them. Only Butters remains, and he turns to watch the others leave. After a few seconds of uncertainty, he leaves too.]"
2353,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh my God! Eric! Eric, [caresses him] Mommy's here. Sweetie? [notices Dr. Doctor] Oh, what's wrong with him?"
2354,8,13,Dr Doctor,"I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma."
2355,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Coma... My God, fo- for how long?"
2356,8,13,Dr Doctor,"There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see. [the camera looks at Cartman, then pans up and fades out]"
2357,8,13,Singers,"Seasons change, time passes by.
As the weeks become the months become the years."
2358,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Eugh... [sits up, his eyes still closed.]"
2359,8,13,Liane Cartman,[stands up and drops her book] Oh my- Doctor! [Cartman blinks] He's awake! [the doctor and nurse return]
2360,8,13,Eric Cartman,Wheh? Where am I?
2361,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!"
2362,8,13,Dr Doctor,"You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time."
2363,8,13,Eric Cartman,Coma... How long?
2364,8,13,Dr Doctor,"It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now."
2365,8,13,Nurse,"Yes, Doctor. [tugs at the facial hair and it comes off.]"
2366,8,13,Dr Doctor,"Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days. [a shot of the hospital's exterior, then back to the recovery room, where Liane is giving Cartman a glass of chocolate milk]"
2367,8,13,Singers,"Seasons change, time passes by. 
As the weeks become the months become the years."
2368,8,13,Liane Cartman,"You're doing so much better, muffin."
2369,8,13,Eric Cartman,Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
2370,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again."
2371,8,13,Dr Doctor,"[at another patient's bed] I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do."
2372,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.
2373,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"We'd better get back to the station, sir."
2374,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!"
2375,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?"
2376,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!"
2377,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"[fishes around in the front shirt pocket and is surprised to find them there, then turns to the doctor] Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?"
2378,8,13,Dr Doctor,"Yes, it was pretty severe."
2379,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"What is it, Lou?"
2380,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
2381,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Aw, come on, sir."
2382,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"I know it's ridiculous, [turns right and walks off] but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can! [Murphy follows. They arrive at Cartman's bed] Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?"
2383,8,13,Eric Cartman,Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
2384,8,13,Nurse 2,"Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time. [the officers are amazed at how timely the nurse came with the lunch]"
2385,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?"
2386,8,13,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, I just knew it. [receives the tray from the nurse and sniffs] Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!"
2387,8,13,Nurse 2,"Yep, meatloaf again. [the officers get a little frightened]"
2388,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Jesus, how did he...?"
2389,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Little boy... [whispers to himself] Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but... [back to Cartman] we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.
2390,8,13,Liane Cartman,His new... powers?
2391,8,13,Female Detective,"All right, make sure you get pictures of everything in this crime scene. [one officer takes pictures, another handles evidence gingerly. Nearby, a police tape is lifted so Cartman could check out the scene]"
2392,8,13,Officer 1,Who's the kid?
2393,8,13,Officer 2,He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.
2394,8,13,Officer 1,"Aw, Christ!"
2395,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"[with Murphy, Liane, and Cartman] This is... where the body was found. [overhead shot] Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others."
2396,8,13,Eric Cartman,How come the outline is missing its hand?
2397,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy. [Cartman walks around the outline, inspecting it.]"
2398,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Stand back, give him room! [moves to hold the crowd back] Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?"
2399,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles... [he sees a hand holding Double-Stuff Oreo] Double-Stuff Oreos... [a second hand comes up and twists off the lower cookie] He ... He's taking the top of one and... [squeezes his eyes closed and sees another Oreo attached to the first one so there are two fillings between the cookies] ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs! [the detective writes down what Cartman is seeing] I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!"
2400,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Jesus Christ!
2401,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Sir?
2402,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!"
2403,8,13,Tom Johansen,"Yes? Oh, hello, detectives."
2404,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?"
2405,8,13,Tom Johansen,"Sure, come on in! [he backs up and leads them in. The lead detectives calls in some officers hidden nearby, and they come in] I'm afraid the house is a little bit of a disaster area since I have-"
2406,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Get him! [the officers tackle Tom Johansen and beat him harshly with their batons] Code 6! Code 6!
2407,8,13,Officer 3,"Use the taser! Use the taser! [another officer fires a taser into Tom Johansen, who then convulses and falls to the floor]"
2408,8,13,Officer 4,"Do it again! [the officer shocks Tom Johansen again, causing more convulsions]"
2409,8,13,Officer 3,"He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him!"
2410,8,13,Tom Johansen,Why?! Why?! [the officers haul him away]
2411,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history."
2412,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough."
2413,8,13,Eric Cartman,Guess again.
2414,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"[walks over and hands him some money] All right, here's a hundred dollars."
2415,8,13,Eric Cartman,Wow!
2416,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"[to Liane] His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good."
2417,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy."
2418,8,13,Eric Cartman,I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
2419,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up. Other kids gather behind him] Cartman, what did you do?!"
2420,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! [shows off the money]"
2421,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
2422,8,13,Eric Cartman,Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
2423,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!"
2424,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!"
2425,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,You don't have any powers!
2426,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!"
2427,8,13,Butters Stotch,"Wuh be careful, Kyle."
2428,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,He can't do crap!
2429,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! [closes his eyes and starts making sound effects and hand motions. The boys behind Kyle except Stan and Kenny scatter, and the detectives spot him as they enter the school.]"
2430,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric! [they approach him, he turns around] We've got a little problem."
2431,8,13,Eric Cartman,What?
2432,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed."
2433,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,This body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it!
2434,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Which can only mean one thing!
2435,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Ha! You see?!
2436,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
2437,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
2438,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.
2439,8,13,Eric Cartman,I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
2440,8,13,Chris Swollenballs,"Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town, where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene. [Cartman approaches the body, which is covered with a red blanket]"
2441,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,This is fuckin' ridiculous!
2442,8,13,Lou,"Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything?"
2443,8,13,Eric Cartman,No. Nothing.
2444,8,13,Officer 5,Maybe his powers have left him.
2445,8,13,Officer 6,Yeah.
2446,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute. [his right arm twitches and he sees a bucket of chicken, then sees some chicken served next to the powdered doughnuts he saw earlier. His eyes are squeezed tight.] Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh! [sees some syrup poured onto the chicken] There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!"
2447,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is wrong with these people?!
2448,8,13,Michael Deets,"[in robe and cap] They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties? [whips open his robe to reveal himself dressed in a yellow bikini. The boys look on, a little afraid]"
2449,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! What about this guy?!
2450,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Quiet! He's havin' a vision!
2451,8,13,Eric Cartman,"It is fried chicken! [first he sees a plate of fried chicken, then the maple syrup, then some whipped cream, then some chocolate syrup, then a cherry on top...] Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae."
2452,8,13,Weird Man,"[brings out a mannequin torso and head and strikes up a conversation with it] ""Junior, what are you doing out?"" I'm sorry, Mother. ""You come home right now and have sex with me!"" No, Mommy! [goes away]"
2453,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!"
2454,8,13,Lou,"I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law!"
2455,8,13,Announcer,"This is Park County News 4, with your host, Jim Brown-ish"
2456,8,13,Jim Brown ish,"The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help."
2457,8,13,Eric Cartman,"If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
[someone knocks on his door, then the door opens]"
2458,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you."
2459,8,13,Eric Cartman,"More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring."
2460,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Ah, no, these people claim that they are the ""real"" psychic detectives. [Cartman stops counting money and freezes]"
2461,8,13,Female Psychic,"So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?!"
2462,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oooh, I'll go make some tea."
2463,8,13,Male Psychic 1,"Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like we all did."
2464,8,13,Other psychics,Yeah!
2465,8,13,Eric Cartman,Proper channels?
2466,8,13,Male Psychic 2,You were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the Psychic Detective School. [shows the ad in question. Looks nice]
2467,8,13,Eric Cartman,I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
2468,8,13,Male Psychic 1,"Well you just can't say you're a psychic detective, you have to use the ad in the comic book!"
2469,8,13,Female Psychic,You must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings!
2470,8,13,Eric Cartman,"[laughs at them] Ten percent, my balls, get lost!"
2471,8,13,Female Psychic,"Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger?"
2472,8,13,Female Psychic,"All right, everyone! [the rest of the psychics join in the battle against Cartman.  Liane returns with the tea.]"
2473,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, goodness! What's going on?"
2474,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!"
2475,8,13,Liane Cartman,O-o-o-o-oh! [prostrates herself]
2476,8,13,Female Psychic,Enough! [one male psychic is slow to respond] We are ...obviously quite evenly matched. I guess this will have to be settled in court.
2477,8,13,Eric Cartman,In court?
2478,8,13,Female Psychic,We brought a class-action lawsuit against you! We'll see you before the judge tomorrow! [the psychics turn and walk out]
2479,8,13,Liane Cartman,Is it over? [the front door closes after the last psychic leaves]
2480,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"[reading from a fact sheet] Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, bus driver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much."
2481,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Jesus Christ! Cause of death?
2482,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing."
2483,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?! [goes to a nearby tree to think] Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!"
2484,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[arriving with Stan and Kenny] Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis. [holds out his findings] I'm pretty sure he's your man."
2485,8,13,Lou,[coolly] How do you know?! Are you psychic?!
2486,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,No.
2487,8,13,Lou,"Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but dammit she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again! [leaves with Murphy]"
2488,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Why won't anybody listen to me?!
2489,8,13,Kenny McCormick,"[pats Kyle on the shoulder] (Don't take it personally, Kyle.)"
2490,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[shrugs Kenny off] I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman."
2491,8,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!"
2492,8,13,Token Black,There has to be another way!
2493,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
2494,8,13,Butters Stotch,"Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean."
2495,8,13,Stan Marsh,"[under his breath] Butters, Goddammit."
2496,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, here we go. [spreads his wings] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! [jumps off and lands on the ground below]"
2497,8,13,Stan Marsh,"[a few moments later, sighs] Call an ambulance."
2498,8,13,Jim Brown ish,"Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying. [footage of the arrests is shown. Two of them are beaten, a third is slammed against a squad car until the side of her head begins to bleed, and a fourth holds police at bay. He tries to fight them with his powers, but they simply open fire and kill him where he stands] The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman, [shown in dramatic pose with psychic waves emanating from his forehead] who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence."
2499,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Cool. [the doorbell rings and Cartman concentrates] Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle! [the door opens and the weird man from the crime scenes enters and approaches Cartman] Who are you?"
2500,8,13,Michael Deets,"You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness."
2501,8,13,Eric Cartman,... 'Kay. Sweet.
2502,8,13,Michael Deets,"Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds."
2503,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second. [hops off the sofa, walks away a bit, and calls out] Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. [the weird man quickly advances and smothers Cartman's face with a cloth, making Cartman inhale chloroform. Cartman passes out.]"
2504,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!"
2505,8,13,Michael Deets,You are obviously a big fan of my work.
2506,8,13,Eric Cartman,I don't even know you dude!
2507,8,13,Michael Deets,But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
2508,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus."
2509,8,13,Michael Deets,"And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim."
2510,8,13,Eric Cartman,"No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!"
2511,8,13,Michael Deets,"Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation! [starts up a slideshow projector] This... is me at the grand canyon. [shows a shot of him there] Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore [the next picture is shown, with him looking lovingly at the faces there] Do you see?"
2512,8,13,Eric Cartman,[nervously] Heheh.
2513,8,13,Michael Deets,Do you see?!
2514,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Yes yes, I see! [another Mount Rushmore picture is shown, with the man looking at the camera this time]"
2515,8,13,Michael Deets,"Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio. [this time he looks psychotic, with his hands ready to grab something] This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?!"
2516,8,13,Eric Cartman,AAAAAAAH!
2517,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,[hangs up the phone] Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!
2518,8,13,Female Detective,"Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours."
2519,8,13,Officer 7,"Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He says another little boy just awoke from a coma, and is having psychic visions!"
2520,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,[grabs his hat] Let's go! [other officers follow]
2521,8,13,Dr Doctor,"This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours. [a shot of Kyle with a bandage around his head. He too has a face warmer on, but no black eye like Cartman had]"
2522,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him."
2523,8,13,Dr Doctor,Of course. Nurse? [a brunette approaches and removes the warmer. Sgt. Lou and Det. Murphy approach the bed]
2524,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?"
2525,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I see... a man... with a baseball cap. [Sgt. Lou snaps his fingers and Det. Murphy whips out a notepad and pen and starts taking notes. Kyle concentrates] He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m."
2526,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"What do you think, Mitch?"
2527,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman. [Kyle clenches his teeth in rage]"
2528,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use."
2529,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,...Sir?
2530,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?"
2531,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,...Restraint?
2532,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint. [they leave]"
2533,8,13,Michael Deets,Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park! [shows off the picture] Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?!
2534,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! [the doorbell is heard. The two detectives are outside, Yates ringing the doorbell. Michael Deets opens the door]"
2535,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr..."
2536,8,13,Michael Deets,God.
2537,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. [he shows them in. The house is dark, with stacks of paper everywhere. Pictures of his victims line the walls. Downstairs, Cartman tries to get attention.]"
2538,8,13,Eric Cartman,(Hey! Come over here!)
2539,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too."
2540,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Sarge! In here! [Lou runs into the next room. They both face a wall of left hands nailed in place]
2541,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy! [Murphy gets right on it. Yates thinks about the hands] Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong."
2542,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Sir?
2543,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.
2544,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Right.
2545,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Well those aren't left hands. [holds up his own left hand, palm in] See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands."
2546,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Ohhh. [they return to the living room]
2547,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Nope, this isn't our man. [they turn to leave the house and see Michael Deets in the shadows] We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. [they head out]"
2548,8,13,Eric Cartman,"[in the basement] (Hey! Help!) [upstairs, Mr. Deets closes the front door]"
2549,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer."
2550,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,[stops and thinks] Yeah... Amazing coincidence...
2551,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,[backs up] Heh- sir?
2552,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right. [thinks for several seconds] Wait a minute."
2553,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Sarge... [Lou slowly raises his hand palm in and analyzes it. Then he turns his hand over slowly until the palm is out and is jolted with recognition] What is it?
2554,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. [runs off to do just that]
2555,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"[back at the station, looks in on Murphy] Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?"
2556,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer?"
2557,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,[snaps his fingers] Oh right! The hands! Right! [the montage resumes]
2558,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Oh my God. Murphy! [Murphy appears quickly.] You're not gonna believe this.
2559,8,13,Michael Deets,"That's it, no more pictures. [walks in front of Cartman and faces him, then pulls out a sharp knife] Time to die."
2560,8,13,Eric Cartman,"No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested."
2561,8,13,Michael Deets,Your hand will be one with the others.
2562,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna- [spots the detectives descend the stairs and approach the room] I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! [begins to concentrate and make noises]"
2563,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Hold it right there, killer! [Michael Deets turns and rushes at them with the knife. Yates fires three shots into him, killing him. The detectives advance, and Yates fires a forth shot into the body, looks around, and fires a fifth shot, getting blood splattered on himself]"
2564,8,13,Eric Cartman,You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
2565,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail."
2566,8,13,Tom Johansen,"Yes, thank you very much, Kyle."
2567,8,13,Female Psychic,"Yes, thanks."
2568,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.
2569,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard."
2570,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Do you think that's true?
2571,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"It must be true. The kid is psychic. [thinks a moment] But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. [they leave the room and then the hospital]"
2572,8,13,Female Psychic,"[addressing Cartman] Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle."
2573,8,13,Eric Cartman,You can't hurt me.
2574,8,13,Male Psychic,"Then let this be our final battle! [the psychics face Cartman once again and battle him with their power. Nothing happens, but there's a lot of noise.]"
2575,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[irritated] Just stop it! [at the top of his lungs] Stoop iiit!! [the lights go out as the bulbs shatter, then the shelf above his bed falls and everything on it hits the floor. The psychics and Cartman stop their battle and witness all this] There's a logical explanation for that."
2576,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Way up in the mountains in a small little town,
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.
People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store.
But out in the forest, not too far away..."
2577,8,14,Narrator and Singers,...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.
2578,8,14,Woodland Critters,"It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.
A Woodland Critter Christmas!"
2579,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat."
2580,8,14,Stan Marsh,[walks by with a sled] What the hell?
2581,8,14,Singer,"Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all"
2582,8,14,Rabbity,"Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest."
2583,8,14,Skunky,How do you like our Christmas tree?
2584,8,14,Stan Marsh,It's... nice.
2585,8,14,Beavery,"Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest! [the other cheer]"
2586,8,14,Mousey,"Oh no, I see a problem."
2587,8,14,Deery,"What is it, Mousey?"
2588,8,14,Mousey,Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.
2589,8,14,Critters,Awww.
2590,8,14,Beary,We can't have a tree with no star on it.
2591,8,14,Rabbity,What are we gonna do?
2592,8,14,Squirrely,"Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star."
2593,8,14,Critters,[among other things] Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?
2594,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay, okay."
2595,8,14,Critters,[cheering] Yay!
2596,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And so, using some paper and working with glee,
the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree."
2597,8,14,Critters,Ohhhh!
2598,8,14,Beary,It's the nicest star I ever saw.
2599,8,14,Narrator and Singers,The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...
2600,8,14,Beavery,How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?
2601,8,14,Narrator and Singers,The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...
2602,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[doesn't smile] Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. [turns around, picks up the reins on his sled and walks off]"
2603,8,14,Beavery,Goo- goodbye Stanny!
2604,8,14,Critters,"Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!"
2605,8,14,Stan Marsh,Woof.
2606,8,14,Critters,"Hi, Stanny!"
2607,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh, whatta? [squeezes his eyelids shut]"
2608,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise!
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!"
2609,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[irritated, grabs his clock] What time is it?!"
2610,8,14,Squirrely,"You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!"
2611,8,14,Skunky,Porcupiney is pregnant!
2612,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[sighs] You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow."
2613,8,14,Mousey,I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.
2614,8,14,Deery,"Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate."
2615,8,14,Foxy,She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.
2616,8,14,Stan Marsh,...What?
2617,8,14,Porcupiney,It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.
2618,8,14,Mousey,So soon!

2638,8,14,Stan Marsh,Go away! Shoo! [The lion moves off and the critters return.]
2639,8,14,Squirrely,Is it gone?
2640,8,14,Mousey,I deduce it is.

the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.
For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat..."
2652,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!"
2653,8,14,Narrator and Singers,Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
2654,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast."
2655,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[gesturing] Grrr! Grrr! Come on out! [The lion is heard roaring from inside the cave, and it roars. It approaches the entrance.] Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! [Anticipating the lion's leap, he runs off. The lion lunges at him, but misses. Stan moves to the side of the peak and turns, gesturing.] Rawrrrrr! [Stan runs up the side of the peak, and the lion follows. Stan reaches the peak and turns to face the lion. The lion lunges at Stan again. Stan drops out of the way and the lion goes over the peak and onto its death below, at the cave entrance.]"
2656,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow!
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below."
2657,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay, there. [three lion cubs approach the entrance]"
2658,8,14,Lion Cub 1,"Mommy? Mommy! [they rush up to her body] W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!"
2659,8,14,Lion Cub 2,"Don't leave us, Mommy. [Stan realizes that this dangerous mountain lion was a mom, so his jaw drops. The pale cub approaches him.] Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?"
2660,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[at a loss for words] I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? [The cubs snuggle close to their mom's body, sobbing.]"
2661,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,
All alone in the world because their mother had died."
2662,8,14,Stan Marsh,[turns away and squeezes his eyes shut] Aw- awww!
2663,8,14,Porcupiney,[feeling a kick] Oooo.
2664,8,14,Beary,"You all right, Lady Porcupiney?"
2665,8,14,Porcupiney,"Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all."
2666,8,14,Beavery,"Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead."
2667,8,14,Foxy,"Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole."
2668,8,14,Rabbity,I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.
2669,8,14,Critters,Awwww.
2670,8,14,Chickadee y,"[flitting straight up into the air] Wait a minute, look! [the animals turn to see Stan approaching them]"

2672,8,14,Mousey,"Stanny, you're alive."
2673,8,14,Beary,"But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?"
2674,8,14,Stan Marsh,It's dead.
2675,8,14,Deery,For real and for true?
2676,8,14,Beavery,Are you sure?
2677,8,14,Stan Marsh,I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
2678,8,14,Squirrely,He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
2679,8,14,Critters,Hail Satan!
2680,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Wait, wha-what?"
2681,8,14,Beavery,"You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!"
2682,8,14,Critters,Yaaay!! [they head over to the manger]
2683,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!"
2684,8,14,Squirrely,"Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness."
2685,8,14,Stan Marsh,But I thought you meant the Son of God!
2686,8,14,Deery,"Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?"
2687,8,14,Chickadee y,"No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!"
2688,8,14,Foxy,This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!
2689,8,14,Rabbity,Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!
2690,8,14,Chickadee y,Drink his blood! Drink his blood!
2691,8,14,Squirrely,[jumps into a puddle of blood] Blood orgy!
2692,8,14,Critters,"Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!"
2693,8,14,Critters,"What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas."
2694,8,14,Squirrely,[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
2695,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,
The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born.
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away.
For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day.
And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat."
2696,8,14,Stan Marsh,Ugh.
2697,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed."
2698,8,14,Stan Marsh,Uuugh!

""I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"""

and went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan enters the living room, hops on the sofa, and turns on the TV. ""The Jeffersons"" theme song is heard. He turns the volume up to drown out the narrator, but to no avail.]
But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee... He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!

2749,8,14,Stan Marsh,[cross] What?!
2750,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed."
2751,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No, he didn't."
2752,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Yes, he did."
2753,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No, he didn't!"
2754,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Yes, he did."
2755,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No, he didn't!"
2756,8,14,Narrator and Singers,Yes... he... [Next scene has Stan holding the cubs at the abortion clinic as the doctor there prepares to abort a baby.] did!
2757,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh, Goddammit! [the doctor and patient are startled]"
2758,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Said the boy in the red poofball hat! ""We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"""
2759,8,14,Abortion Doctor,"[walks over] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!"
2760,8,14,Narrator and Singers,The abortion doctor inquired.
2761,8,14,Abortion Doctor,"If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!"
2762,8,14,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous."
2763,8,14,Abortion Doctor,"Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!
It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform!
Gather around my table, cute little lions,
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!"
2764,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base,
And all day watched abortion after abortion take place."
2765,8,14,Singer,"Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year."
2766,8,14,Stan Marsh,"This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point."
2767,8,14,Critters,"It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year."
2768,8,14,Beary,Oh look. That little feller is all alone.
2769,8,14,Skunky,"Gee, he looks sad. [Kyle is seen kneeling next to his sled, looking sad.]"
2770,8,14,Critters,Hi there!
2771,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,[gets up and turns around] What the hell?
2772,8,14,Beavery,How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
2773,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
2774,8,14,Raccoony,"Aww, but why?"
2775,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus."
2776,8,14,Critters,[cheering] Yay!
2777,8,14,Beary,But does that mean you aren't baptized?
2778,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,No. I'm Jewish.
2779,8,14,Critters,[exulting] Yay! Yay! [they gather around Kyle]
2780,8,14,Beavery,You've got to come with us!
2781,8,14,Deery,You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!
2782,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
2783,8,14,Critters,[taking him away] Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!
2784,8,14,Critters,"What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas."
2785,8,14,Squirrely,[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
2786,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high,
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.
For the world to be saved there was only one shot,
A little boy with three clubs and an abortion plot."
2787,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?"
2788,8,14,Lion Cub 3,Sure. We know how to give abortions now.
2789,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,
but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight."
2790,8,14,Beavery,"Gosh, we did it!"
2791,8,14,Squirrely,"The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. [The Antichrist growls and throws little fits.]"
2792,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate.
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late."
2793,8,14,Stan Marsh,Too late?! The hell is that?!
2794,8,14,Beavery,"Oh. Hiya, Stanny!"
2795,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[now tied to the altar, frightened] Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!"
2796,8,14,Stan Marsh,"It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!"
2797,8,14,Skunky,Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.
2798,8,14,Critters,Let's go! All right! Woohoo!
2799,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[turns to the lion cubs] That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! [Skunky, Squirrely, Beary, and Chickadee-y walk over to get Kyle. Santa's sleigh appears in the sky.]"
2800,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!"
2801,8,14,Beavery,"Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!"
2802,8,14,Critters,[cheering] Yay!
2803,8,14,Raccoony,Let's eat his flesh! [the sleigh lands and rolls to a stop]
2804,8,14,Santa Claus,"[hops out] All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!"
2805,8,14,Raccoony,"We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny."
2806,8,14,Skunky,Death and pain await all living things.
2807,8,14,Santa Claus,"Little boy, you should be ashamed!"
2808,8,14,Stan Marsh,"I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!"
2809,8,14,Santa Claus,"Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! [He reaches back and whips out a long shotgun. He fires, and the top half of Beavery's head is gone.]"
2810,8,14,Critters,"Aaaaah! [They scatter. Santa fires again, and Deery goes down. Two more shots and the tops of Raccoony's and Skunky's heads come off.]"
2811,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the- ? [Squirrely activates his demon power with the red glow from his eyes and a wall of hellfire appears before Santa.]"
2812,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Hold steady, Santa."
2813,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[goes to untie Kyle from the altar] Come on, dude. [Santa continues firing at the remaining critters. Porcupiney is blown apart, then Foxy.]"
2814,8,14,Beary,"Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you- [His head is blown off and he goes down.]"
2815,8,14,Dark Cub,"But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist? [Stan and Kyle join Santa and the cubs.]"
2816,8,14,Santa Claus,"Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into."
2817,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks down] No. [walks towards the manger] No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!"
2818,8,14,Stan Marsh,What?! Kyle?!
2819,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[now in the manger, behind the trough] With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!"
2820,8,14,Santa Claus,"Don't do it, Kyle! [Grinning evilly, Kyle holds the little Antichrist in his left hand. A glow emanates from the Antichrist and its spirit floats out of its body and into Kyle's chest.]"
2821,8,14,Stan Marsh,Dude!
2822,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[returns to the altar, climbs up, and exults] Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!"
2823,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[voice-over] Oh, stop it, Cartman! [the spell is broken]"
2824,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
2825,8,14,Eric Cartman,"I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. [behind him on the board is written ""Write Your Own Christmas Story Day""]"
2826,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
2827,8,14,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?"
2828,8,14,Mr Garrison,"Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother."
2829,8,14,Eric Cartman,"[closes his booklet] All right, fine! Forget it! [He drops off the stool and heads for his desk.]"
2830,8,14,Butters Stotch,"Well but, but what happened?"
2831,8,14,Token Black,Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
2832,8,14,Clyde Donovan,What happens to the lion cubs?
2833,8,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends."
2834,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner."
2835,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, why do you care?!"
2836,8,14,Stan Marsh,Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
2837,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
2838,8,14,Eric Cartman,That's not at all what happens.
2839,8,14,Butters Stotch,"Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end."
2840,8,14,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah yeah, come on! [the other kids chime in]"
2841,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine!"
2842,8,14,Eric Cartman,"[He returns to the stool and resumes the story. He clears his throat.] ""Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat."
2843,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the -- [feels something...] Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this! [hops off the altar] I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!"
2844,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil."
2845,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, what have I done?! [sits down] I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist."
2846,8,14,Santa Claus,"[with his shotgun at the ready] I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! [pumps the shotgun]"
2847,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No Santa, don't!"
2848,8,14,Santa Claus,"We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul."
2849,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl,
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all."
2850,8,14,Stan Marsh,The lion cubs!
2851,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The little boy quickly begun,"
2852,8,14,Stan Marsh,I took them to see how abortions are done.
2853,8,14,Santa Claus,What?
2854,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!"
2855,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion."
2856,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there."
2857,8,14,Santa Claus,"Well little boy, it seems that you [points to Stan] have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?"
2858,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[smiles] Yeah. Yeah, there is."
2859,8,14,Mother Lion,"Wha -- Oh my, what happened?"
2860,8,14,One of the Cubs,[the three of them run up to greet her] Mommy?
2861,8,14,The Mountain Lion's Cubs,"Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!"
2862,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[relieved] Oh, good."
2863,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat.
And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball hat."
2864,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later. [Q shot of Kyle back in the hospital, dying.]"
2865,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[voice-over] Goddammit, Cartman!"
2866,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"[as credits roll]
Christmastime is once a year,
Every creature holds it dear,
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means the world to us all,
It's once a year, it's Christmastime,
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year."
