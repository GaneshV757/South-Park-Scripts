0,8,6,Stan Marsh,"[stops and looks at a house] Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. [the other boys stop and look.]"
1,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago."
2,8,6,Eric Cartman,I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. [a door is heard opening]
3,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[points] Hey Look!
4,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Hello!
5,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hey. Do you live here?
6,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?"
7,8,6,Eric Cartman,No.
8,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything."
9,8,6,Stan Marsh,What's that you're wearing?
10,8,6,Blanket Jackson,It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
11,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now."
12,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
13,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. [they turn away.]"
14,8,6,Blanket Jackson,We have arcade games inside.
15,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Dad?
16,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Whoa. Dude, no way!"
17,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, this is awesome! [runs up to a claw machine]"
18,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, are these all your toys?"
19,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games."
20,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do?"
21,8,6,Blanket Jackson,He's retired now.
22,8,6,Eric Cartman,"[guiding the machine's arm to grab a plush toy] Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!"
23,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. [guides the other three boys out]"
24,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!"
25,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Dad? You out here?
26,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Here I am, Blanket!"
27,8,6,Michael Jackson,Heeee!
28,8,6,Michael Jackson,Jeh chabee durtah!
29,8,6,Michael Jackson,Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!
30,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] What's wrong with his face?
31,8,6,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something."
32,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-"
33,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?"
34,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Come on, let's climb the tree! [turns to a tree and scales it] Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree!"
35,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree. 
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. 
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key."
36,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up."
37,8,6,Michael Jackson,Won't you imagine along with me?
38,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Jefferson?
39,8,6,Michael Jackson,"We can be spacemen, 
or pirates on the sea
Chuckajamonah!
Yes we can do everything,
and I mean, everything!
Chuckajamonah!
Up in my Wishing Tree!
Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!"
40,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you guys! You guys! [the kids gather around] You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!"
41,8,6,Red,The Jeffersons?
42,8,6,Eric Cartman,[breathless] They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! [his chest heaves noticeably]
43,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
44,8,6,Eric Cartman,"They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train."
45,8,6,Craig Tucker,[in a monotone voice] No way.
46,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!"
47,8,6,Craig Tucker,[not wanting to be left out] I believe in Mr. Jefferson!
48,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!"
49,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Who wants the first cotton candy?
50,8,6,Kids,Memememememememememe
51,8,6,Michael Jackson,Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!
52,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!"
53,8,6,Eric Cartman,Choo-choo train! Yay!
54,8,6,Michael Jackson,Let's ride the train! The train!
55,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?"
56,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson."
57,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Cartman, you have a beautiful voice."
58,8,6,Eric Cartman,Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
59,8,6,Michael Jackson,Let's ride and ride on the train together
60,8,6,Eric Cartman,...Train together
61,8,6,Michael Jackson,On a journey through both of our minds.
62,8,6,Eric Cartman,I've got time. Do youuu??
63,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what happened to your knee?"
64,8,6,Blanket Jackson,[his skinned knee is shown] I fell down.
65,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[calls out] Mr. Jefferson!
66,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[back on the train] Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games."
67,8,6,Eric Cartman,Choo-choo train.
68,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr-Â ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. [takes Blanket inside]"
69,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, this is gonna sting for a second."
70,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Ow!
71,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, I know. Be cool."
72,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Thank you. That already feels better.
73,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?"
74,8,6,Blanket Jackson,I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
75,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,And where is your mom?
76,8,6,Blanket Jackson,I don't have a mom.
77,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,You must have a mom.
78,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?"
79,8,6,Blanket Jackson,No. I was made in a laboratory.
80,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,What?
81,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home."
82,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,So you never met your mom?
83,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts."
84,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Yeah, that counts."
85,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!"
86,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid."
87,8,6,Eric Cartman,You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
88,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one."
89,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! [faces Kyle down] Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! [turns and walks away angrily]"
90,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon."
91,8,6,Stan Marsh,"I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons."
92,8,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, are they nice people?"
93,8,6,Stan Marsh,Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
94,8,6,Sharon Marsh,"Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too."
95,8,6,Gerald Broflovski,"So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?"
96,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Kentucky, yeah."
97,8,6,Randy Marsh,I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
98,8,6,Michael Jackson,"No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant."
99,8,6,Stephen Stotch,"What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?"
100,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals"
101,8,6,Sheila Broflovski,Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
102,8,6,Michael Jackson,"I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child."
103,8,6,Randy Marsh,....Yeeeah.
104,8,6,Sharon Marsh,"...They are fun. [glances back, away from the table] Boys, you okay out there?"
105,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Fine, Mom."
106,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Wow, these are great. What are they called again?"
107,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
108,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden."
109,8,6,Eric Cartman,What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
110,8,6,Stan Marsh,"No, my parents are."
111,8,6,Eric Cartman,You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
112,8,6,Stan Marsh,What?
113,8,6,Eric Cartman,"He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, [Stan steps back...] and I-"
114,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!"
115,8,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today."
116,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?"
117,8,6,Michael Jackson,[taken aback] D'huh?
118,8,6,Stephen Stotch,I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
119,8,6,Michael Jackson,I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.
120,8,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?"
121,8,6,Michael Jackson,Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.
122,8,6,Harris,"Hey Sergeant, take a look at this."
123,8,6,Harrison Yates,[disregards the sheet] Whatcha got?
124,8,6,Harris,"Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money."
125,8,6,Harrison Yates,"So, what's the problem?"
126,8,6,Harris,Take a look. Says here... [the sergeant takes the sheet and reviews it] He's black.
127,8,6,Harrison Yates,"By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe."
128,8,6,Harrison Yates,Let's go people!
129,8,6,Harrison Yates,"We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!"
130,8,6,Stan Marsh,[looks out] Kyle?
131,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'? [dances a little]"
132,8,6,Stan Marsh,Mr. Jefferson Awww! [hops off the bed] It's 1:30 in the morning!
133,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Look at me, I'm Peter Pan."
134,8,6,Michael Jackson,"T-shamon!
I'm a little boy forever."
135,8,6,Michael Jackson,Hey!
136,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!"
137,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!"
138,8,6,Stan Marsh,He just showed up here.
139,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. [a knock is heard at Stan's door]"
140,8,6,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
141,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard."
142,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"[wearing his veil] Hi, Stan."
143,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
144,8,6,Stan Marsh,I know. He's here.
145,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
146,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!"
147,8,6,Stan Marsh,"No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home."
148,8,6,Michael Jackson,We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.
149,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Dad says it wants to eat us.
150,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!"
151,8,6,Blanket Jackson,We're scared!
152,8,6,Mr Jefferson,Hee hee!
153,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!"
154,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Blanket."
155,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight"
156,8,6,Eric Cartman,Deeper.
157,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome."
158,8,6,Michael Jackson,"I think you're awesome too, Cartman."
159,8,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah?
160,8,6,Michael Jackson,Yeah.
161,8,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah?
162,8,6,Michael Jackson,Yeah.
163,8,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah?
164,8,6,Stan Marsh,Ahaa!
165,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[wakes up] What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?"
166,8,6,Stan Marsh,Yeah. A really bad dream.
167,8,6,Stan Marsh,Oh Jesus!
168,8,6,Harrison Yates,"[using his walkie-talkie] Murphy, you inside?"
169,8,6,Detective Murphy,"[walking through the arcade room] We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch!"
170,8,6,Detective Murphy,I'm planting the cocaine now.
171,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Johnson, what about you?"
172,8,6,Johnson,"[in a closet] Placing the blood spatter now, sir. [right on a pair of Jefferson's shoes]"
173,8,6,Harrison Yates,Frakes?
174,8,6,Frakes,"Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir."
175,8,6,Harrison Yates,"All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras. [sighs] Why do we do it, Harris?"
176,8,6,Harris,Sir?
177,8,6,Harrison Yates,Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
178,8,6,Harris,"Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it."
179,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride."
180,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Stan, time to get up for school. [opens the door and looks in] Stan? What the-? [sees the five people in bed] Mr. Jefferson?!"
181,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[sits up quickly] Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party."
182,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!"
183,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself."
184,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. [gives each of them 100 dollar bills]"
185,8,6,Randy Marsh,"Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. [leaves, and Sharon watches him go]"
186,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. [quickly leaves with Blanket in tow]"
187,8,6,Sharon Marsh,"Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?"
188,8,6,Stan Marsh,"You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!"
189,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! [Stan, Kyle, and Sharon are shocked]"
190,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Come on, Blanket!"
191,8,6,Harrison Yates,Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!
192,8,6,Harris,[walks] Wha- wha- what?
193,8,6,Harrison Yates,"It's Jefferson! He's back! [gets on his communicator] All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home."
194,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Whoa, wait a minute! [withdraws his gun] That guy isn't black!"
195,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus! [gets on his communicator] This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!"
196,8,6,Harrison Yates,"You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!"
197,8,6,Harris,It says right here on the final sheet he is!
198,8,6,Harrison Yates,[shoves Harris's face against the windshield] Does that look like a black guy to you?!
199,8,6,Harris,It said on the final sheet!
200,8,6,Harrison Yates,[throws a fit] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!
201,8,6,Harrison Yates,Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.
202,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?"
203,8,6,Harris,"Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it."
204,8,6,Harrison Yates,[whips around and says menacingly] To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!
205,8,6,Michael Jackson,"All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!"
206,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[stops] That poor kid.
207,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there."
208,8,6,Blanket Jackson,[opens his windows as they approach] Hi guys!
209,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?"
210,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Really? You mean it?
211,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[interrupts, clapping] Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!"
212,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us."
213,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!"
214,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood."
215,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket? [picks him up and moves him around through the open window] Wee, look! He can fly!"
216,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[the boys fear for Blanket's life] Jesus Christ, dude!"
217,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Aaaaaah! [Mr. Jefferson dangles him around by his left foot]
218,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Stop, you fucking lunatic! [Mr. Jefferson's moustache falls off and down to the ground, he pulls Blanket back inside and closes the window]"
219,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!"
220,8,6,Michael Jackson,"No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look."
221,8,6,Michael Jackson,Jeekabee durtah! [a kick and outstretched arm] Ow!
222,8,6,Michael Jackson,"There, Blanket, shhhh. [tries to distract Blanket] Hey, hey look, hey look."
223,8,6,Michael Jackson,"I got your nose. [does it again.] Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See?"
224,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Aaaaaaaah! [throws it away and runs out of his bedroom]
225,8,6,Michael Jackson,"No, Blanket, stop!"
226,8,6,Michael Jackson,It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!
227,8,6,Maggie Yates,"Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry."
228,8,6,Harrison Yates,"I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force."
229,8,6,Maggie Yates,Quitting the force? You?
230,8,6,Harrison Yates,"None of it makes sense anymore. [sits down and unloads his frustrations] I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired."
231,8,6,Maggie Yates,"[approaches and consoles him] Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yates. [he looks up at her] Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wiping that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrison Yates. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you. [she caresses him, he kisses her hand]"
232,8,6,Harrison Yates,"And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. [abruptly rises and goes to the coat rack]"
233,8,6,Maggie Yates,Where're you goin'?
234,8,6,Harrison Yates,Think I've got a little more work to do. [puts on his coat and heads outside]
235,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?"
236,8,6,Michael Jackson,"No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!"
237,8,6,Michael Jackson,I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!
238,8,6,Michael Jackson,But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!
239,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Oh, I'm melting!"
240,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude."
241,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"Yeah, sure, whatever."
242,8,6,Stan Marsh,You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
243,8,6,Kenny McCormick,Aren't I too big to be Blanket?
244,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[seething as he climbs the ladder] I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! [Stan and Kenny follow]
245,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Blanket, you in here?"
246,8,6,Blanket Jackson,[excited] Hi guys!
247,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? [Kenny looks around]"
248,8,6,Blanket Jackson,"You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
249,8,6,Stan Marsh,"All right dude, get in his bed."
250,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"[gets under the covers] All right, but you guys owe me for this."
251,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. [hops off and leaves]"
252,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl."
253,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado."
254,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?"
255,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?"
256,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves."
257,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Well, he doesn't really look that black."
258,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial."
259,8,6,Harrison Yates,You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
260,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges."
261,8,6,Harrison Yates,"Molestation, nice."
262,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarrassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!"
263,8,6,Harrison Yates,"That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine."
264,8,6,Sgt. Snetzl,"Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure."
265,8,6,Harrison Yates,[rises from his chair. Other officers draw near] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
266,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson, hello?!"
267,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us."
268,8,6,Michael Jackson,What are you doing with my Blanket?
269,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee! [an outstretched arm]"
270,8,6,Stan Marsh,Haaaaa!
271,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Haaaaa!
272,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Haaaaa!
273,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Go, go, ruuun! [the boys run out of the bathroom]"
274,8,6,Mr Jefferson,[whispers as he walks] Sutah!
275,8,6,Stan Marsh,Haaaaa!
276,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,Haaaaa!
277,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Haaaaa!
278,8,6,Michael Jackson,[rounds a corner onto the hallway] Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!
279,8,6,Stan Marsh,[The boys enter Blanket's room] Oh Jesus!
280,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"What the hell is going on, you guys?"
281,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[enters and heads for Blanket's bed] My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket! [pulls Kenny out of the bed]"
282,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!"
283,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[tossing Kenny up into the air] Wee, he can fly! He can fly!"
284,8,6,Kenny McCormick,"Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-"
285,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!"
286,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
287,8,6,Michael Jackson,Blanket? Blanket! Come play! [slowly approaches the boys]
288,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Nooo! [Stan turns to leave]
289,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,[grabs Blanket's hand and leaves as well] Come on!
290,8,6,Stan Marsh,"Run, Blanket, Run!"
291,8,6,Blanket Jackson,[stumbles] Ah!
292,8,6,Michael Jackson,[exits] Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!
293,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[Kyle and Stan help Blanket up] Hang on, Blanket!"
294,8,6,Mr Jefferson,[shielding his eyes] Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!
295,8,6,Harrison Yates,"[through his bullhorn] Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!"
296,8,6,Eric Cartman,"[hops to Mr. Jefferson's defense, standing in front of him] No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! [a crowd, including the boys' parents, gathers] All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!"
297,8,6,Michael Jackson,It's ignorant.
298,8,6,Eric Cartman,"Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child."
299,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[returns with Blanket] All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!"
300,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!"
301,8,6,Michael Jackson,"[closeup for a few seconds] You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh. [genuflects behind Blanket] Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting."
302,8,6,Blanket Jackson,Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.
303,8,6,Harrison Yates,"[approaches with Harris] Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail."
304,8,6,Kyle Broflovski,All right! Things just might work out!
305,8,6,Michael Jackson,"Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change."
306,8,6,Michael Jackson,"We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!"
