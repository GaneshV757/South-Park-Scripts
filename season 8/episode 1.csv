0,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops so he doesn't get hurt and glares] Stop it, Cartman!"
1,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Pfaha, so funny. [pulls out another firecracker, tosses it before Kyle, and cackles]"
2,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops] Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! [Cartman cackles some more. The boys approach a booth: Roger's Edge]"
3,8,1,Roger,"Come on and take a look, folks. We've got a lot of knives for sale here. [Stan stops before a table, ""Weapons of Asia,"" and marvels at the weapons displayed there.]"
4,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, look! [the other boys turn and walk up] Martial arts weapons from the Far East. [the sign reads ""Martial arts weapons of the Far East""]"
5,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[softly] Wow, cool."
6,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas."
7,8,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
8,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away] Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. [the others turn as well]"
9,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!"
10,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought. [the boys turn back to face the table] I'll get the tonfas. [they look like the nightsticks police use, but made of wood] Those are so sweet."
11,8,1,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna get those killer sai. [swords with horns at the hilt are in there. Cartman notices a weapon off to the right] Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken [ninja star] for a dollar ninety nine.
12,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(Shuriken. Awesome!)
13,8,1,Roger,[approaches] Can I help you boys? [the boys step back from the table to see him.]
14,8,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
15,8,1,Roger,"Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission. [the boys look at each other]"
16,8,1,Eric Cartman,Parents? Parents?! [fakes a sob] Oh God! [starts sobbing loudly and turns away.]
17,8,1,Roger,Wha- wha- what's the matter? [Cartman continues sobbing]
18,8,1,Stan Marsh,"We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year."
19,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Why?! [Stan cries, then covers his eyes. Cartman turns around, still sobbing] Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?! [Kenny begins to sob] Why?! [Kyle observes his friends, then joins them in the sobbing]"
20,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
21,8,1,Roger,"[tries to soothe them] It's all right, it's all right boys. Don't cry, I'll... I'll just... go pack these up for you, okay? [takes a few weapons and leaves. The boys cry a bit more, then stop]"
22,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked."
23,8,1,Stan Marsh,[with his tonfa] Kiya! Kiya!
24,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Kaii yo! [one end of his nunchaku hits his hat a few times]
25,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you! [lunges] Iya!"
26,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[sweeps one of his tonfa around and transforms] With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like."
27,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku [he transforms], a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble."
28,8,1,Stan Marsh,"What's your ninja name, Kenny?"
29,8,1,Kenny McCormick,[already transformed] (unintelligible)
30,8,1,Eric Cartman,[already transformed] Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies.
31,8,1,Stan Marsh,"All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!"
32,8,1,Eric Cartman,Kick ass! [the boys head out]
33,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous."
34,8,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)"
35,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[cautions] No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them."
36,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!"
37,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[the background is a motion blur] You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!"
38,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true."
39,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go. [they walk off and approach Craig's house, which is done up in Japanese style. Stan stops and whispers] All right, this is it."
40,8,1,Eric Cartman,Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. [the boys approach quickly]
41,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,I still say this is a bad idea.
42,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Ninja positions! [the boys get into their first positions and Craig opens the door] Hello, Craig!"
43,8,1,Eric Cartman,[shows off his sai] Look what we got.
44,8,1,Craig Tucker,Where'd you get those?
45,8,1,Stan Marsh,We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
46,8,1,Eric Cartman,"[moves past Stan] Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy."
47,8,1,Craig Tucker,"Uh-uh, they're not that cool."
48,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Hyeah, ""they're not that cool."" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East."
49,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,But don't tell anybody we have them.
50,8,1,Eric Cartman,Ugh.
51,8,1,Token Black,"[appears with Clyde, behind Craig] Whoa! Where'd you get those?!"
52,8,1,Clyde Donovan,Let me see.
53,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. [turns and walks away]"
54,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril. [he and the other two turn and walk away as well] Come on, ninjas!"
55,8,1,All,Ho! [they trot off. Craig closes the door]
56,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!"
57,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! [Butters shows up before them]"
58,8,1,Butters Stotch,Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
59,8,1,Eric Cartman,"We're playing Ninjas, Butters."
60,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?"
61,8,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us."
62,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys. [the boys turn and walk off] We have a lot of work to do."
63,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Yes, and no time to do it. No time... [Butters stands in the open alone]"
64,8,1,Butters Stotch,"I think I'd make a really good ninja. [turns right and walks off towards home, rejected] Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. [opens the front door and enters]"
65,8,1,Butters Stotch,I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
66,8,1,Linda Stotch,Hi Butters.
67,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Hi Mom. [walks upstairs] -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude. [enters his room and heads for the closet] And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil. [enters the closet] Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time! [one swoosh of his cape and he transforms] Professor Chaos! [he holds his hands some distance apart and a ball of energy appears. This electrifies his whole body] Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! [cackles. Now transformed, he makes his way downstairs. The stairs crack under his weight. He smashes his left fist into the wall, leaving a small crater in it. His mom looks on from the couch]"
68,8,1,Linda Stotch,"Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?"
69,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[in a gravelly voice] Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while."
70,8,1,Linda Stotch,"Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week."
71,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, o- okay Mom. [sees the pie on the small end table by the foot of the stairs and carries it off] Bah! Gah! [in his mind, he's big and powerful. Every step he takes affects the house. The first dislodges the family portrait, the second dislodges it more, the third knocks it to the ground. He opens the front door, goes out and slams it shot, knocking it off its hinges]"
72,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction."
73,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next."
74,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it."
75,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!"
76,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!"
77,8,1,Eric Cartman,I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
78,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
79,8,1,Eric Cartman,I have the power to have all the powers I want.
80,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"That doesn't count, fatass!"
81,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!"
82,8,1,Eric Cartman,[protests] C'mon!
83,8,1,Butters Stotch,Haaa ha ha ha ha! [he appears with energy bristling all around him] Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
84,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Who the hell is that?
85,8,1,Stan Marsh,"I dunno. Craig, is that you?"
86,8,1,Butters Stotch,[strikes a ground pose] Fools! [jumps into the air and more energy surges from him. A fireball appears between his hands] I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom! [closeup] Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
87,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa.
88,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys."
89,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
90,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[steps forth] Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa! [Stan strikes a battle pose and unleashes the energy from the tonfa tips. Butters shields himself with his cape, and the tonfa energy dissipates. Butters cackles] Hey kid, that knocks you down."
91,8,1,Butters Stotch,Nuh uh!
92,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, huh, I got you!"
93,8,1,Butters Stotch,Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
94,8,1,Eric Cartman,That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
95,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! [whips them around a few times and unleashes an icy stream of energy towards Butters. The blasts knock Butters out of the air and he hits the ground with a thud.]"
96,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding! [leaps up into the air and jumps back down, strikes the ground with his right fist, and the ground cracks towards the boys, ending with them being tossed into the air. The boys land on the ground again and look up at Butters] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! [two spiderwebs drop down and trap Stan and Kyle]"
97,8,1,Eric Cartman,"All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay! [Cartman attempts to unleash energy with his hands, but nothing happens.] Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!"
98,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, okay, you can have your powers back."
99,8,1,Eric Cartman,All right! And now I will use my power to... [faces the other boys] turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! [in an instant Kyle becomes a chicken]
100,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,God dammit Cartman!
101,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!"
102,8,1,Butters Stotch,Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
103,8,1,Stan Marsh,Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
104,8,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!) [shows off an eight-pointed shuriken] (Feel my wrath!) [unleashes the shuriken, and it strikes Butters in the eye. Butters' helmet flies off, revealing his puff-ball hair and the shuriken embedded in the bloody left eye. The music abruptly stops and the boys are shown in regular form. Butters looks at the boys and sobs loudly]"
105,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, shit, dude!"
106,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[he and Kyle rush over to Butters] Butters! Oh my God! [the boys gather around Butters] Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!"
107,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!"
108,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
109,8,1,Butters Stotch,It hurts! It hurts! [continues to sob]
110,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
111,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[tries to soothe Butters] Shhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really."
112,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[trying to catch his breath] But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! [Butters continues to shriek in agonizing pain while Stan looks around nervously, with gritted teeth]"
113,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! [Butters composes himself and sobs softly, looking around from time to time for any sign of help]"
114,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Guys, meeting over here for a second? [the boys move off and huddle] All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard."
115,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, shut up!"
116,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,I agree with Cartman!
117,8,1,Stan Marsh,What?!
118,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
119,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Just stay still, Butters."
120,8,1,Butters Stotch,[Stan tugs again] Ah. [Stan tugs harder] Hwa! [Stan tugs even harder] Hwaaaaa!
121,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
122,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us."
123,8,1,Butters Stotch,You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! [whimpers]
124,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened."
125,8,1,Stan Marsh,God dammit!
126,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[moves off] God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again."
127,8,1,Eric Cartman,"[approaches] Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle. [to the huddle] Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character."
128,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, I'm getting woozy."
129,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Butters. [to the other boys] Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. [puts his fingertips to his temples. Kenny touches his right temple, Stan, his chin]"
130,8,1,Stan Marsh,"We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?"
131,8,1,Eric Cartman,Dr. Shafley?
132,8,1,Stan Marsh,He's really old and going blind.
133,8,1,Eric Cartman,So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
134,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no.
135,8,1,Stan Marsh,We might pass him off as our pet.
136,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[sniffling] But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded."
137,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Butters!"
138,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, Butters!"
139,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Butters!"
140,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!"
141,8,1,Stan Marsh,"All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened."
142,8,1,Eric Cartman,Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. [Kyle hands him the glue]
143,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[between whimpers] Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy."
144,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!"
145,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We need some more fur. [Stan walks over to Sparky and shaves off fur from areas of his body still unshaved, then walks back to Kyle and hands him the fur. Kyle places the fur on Butters' left leg] I think that's good."
146,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters."
147,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff."
148,8,1,Stan Marsh,All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
149,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[looks off to his left] Okay, it's clear. [turns right and walks on. Cartman and Kyle escort Butters between them]"
150,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot."
151,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[practices his bark unprompted] Wuhuff, woof, woof."
152,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! [some trash bin noises are heard and the boys face the source of the noises]"
153,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh shit, somebody's coming!"
154,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Quick, hide Butters! [Cartman drags Butters to an oven]"
155,8,1,Eric Cartman,In here! [opens its door and shoves Butters in]
156,8,1,Butters Stotch,"bu- but fellas, I gotta- [Cartman closes the door. Craig and his boys appear]"
157,8,1,Craig Tucker,"Aha! [the three remaining boys quickly face Craig's crew] There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! [Craig and his boys present their weapons]"
158,8,1,Eric Cartman,"No way, you got weapons too?!"
159,8,1,Stan Marsh,Where'd you get those?
160,8,1,Jimmy Valmer,"From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-"
161,8,1,Clyde Donovan,From the nice guy at the county fair.
162,8,1,Craig Tucker,"At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead."
163,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon!"
164,8,1,Craig Tucker,"So, [unsheathes his sword] how would you ninjas like to do battle?"
165,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, not now, Craig, we have to be going."
166,8,1,Craig Tucker,You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! [Clyde crosses his kamas against each other]
167,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"He said, not now, Craig!"
168,8,1,Craig Tucker,"I am not Craig, [twirls his sword] I am Ginza, [transforms] with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!"
169,8,1,Token Black,"And I am Black Chaku, [twirls his nunchakus and transforms] with the power of perfect spelling!"
170,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Guys, we're really not playing, okay? [Jimmy has already transformed and leaps into the air, twirling his kali sticks around, and lands in a powerful pose]"
171,8,1,Jimmy Valmer,"Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?"
172,8,1,Eric Cartman,[the boys are back in anime form] We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
173,8,1,Clyde Donovan,Then fight us!
174,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!"
175,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,I swore to never fight again.
176,8,1,Stan Marsh,"We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! [He begins his attack. The other boys move forth and the fight begins, as a song reminiscent of Japanese anime theme songs, mostly Japanese with occasional English words, starts playing; its lyrics appear as a sing-along along the bottom of the screen.]"
177,8,1,Singer,"Subarashii chinchin mono
Kintama no kame aru
Sore no oto ha ""saru bobo"" Iie!
Ninja ga imasu
Hey Hey Let's Go! kenka suru
Taisetsu no mono protect my balls
Boku ga warui so let's fighting 
Let's fighting love...Let's fighting love... Kono uta chotto baka
Wake ga wakaranai
Eigo ga mechakucha
Daijobu?  We do it all the time!
Hey hey let's go  kenka suru..."
178,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait! [the song ends, and he looks around] Wait. [steps forward] Hold on a second. Where's Butters? [sees the open oven door, and no one in the oven]"
179,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no. Butters!
180,8,1,Eric Cartman,Butters!
181,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[turns and faces Craig's boys] Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!"
182,8,1,Craig Tucker,Lose who?
183,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Craig] Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!"
184,8,1,Craig Tucker,Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
185,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!"
186,8,1,Craig Tucker,"Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!"
187,8,1,Stan Marsh,"No dude, you gotta help us find him!"
188,8,1,Craig Tucker,To hell with that!
189,8,1,Eric Cartman,"We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!"
190,8,1,Butters Stotch,"Hello? Anybody-eh. [the driver appears again and slows down to observe Butters. His right eyebrow rises] Woof. Woof. Woofwoof. [his voice softens] Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. [the drives speeds up and drives off. Butters turns and continues his lonely walk. Back near Skid Row the eight boys walk along searching for Butters.]"
191,8,1,Stan Marsh,Butters!
192,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Butters!
193,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Here, Butters!"
194,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(Butters!)
195,8,1,Craig Tucker,Butters!
196,8,1,Clyde Donovan,Butters!
197,8,1,Token Black,Butters!
198,8,1,Jimmy Valmer,Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
199,8,1,Eric Cartman,Butter- Butters!
200,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Butters!
201,8,1,Stan Marsh,Butters!
202,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, look! [a black man walks up in anime form, stops, and looks around]"
203,8,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
204,8,1,The Boys,"Hey, Chef."
205,8,1,Chef,How's it goin'?
206,8,1,Stan Marsh,Bad.
207,8,1,Chef,Why bad?
208,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?"
209,8,1,Chef,"No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?"
210,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Nothing, just... playing."
211,8,1,Chef,"Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out."
212,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we know."
213,8,1,Chef,"Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! [turns and walks away]"
214,8,1,Nurse,[behind the counter] Oh my God! [leaves her station and kneels down next to Butters] What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?!
215,8,1,Dr Doctor,[approaches and kneels down next to Butters] Jesus Christ. [Butters shakes his head and babbles] What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.
216,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[moans, then opens his eyes] Woof woof."
217,8,1,Nurse,"Can you help him, Doctor?"
218,8,1,Dr Doctor,"I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter."
219,8,1,Nurse,[rises and leaves] Right away.
220,8,1,Announcer,"[with recaps from the episode] In our last episode the four ninjas did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom. It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons, if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped, and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded."
221,8,1,Stan Marsh,Butters!
222,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Butters!
223,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Here, Butters!"
224,8,1,Kenny McCormick,(Butters!)
225,8,1,Craig Tucker,Butters!
226,8,1,Clyde Donovan,Butters!
227,8,1,Token Black,Butters!
228,8,1,Craig Tucker,Butters! Where the hell are you?!
229,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! [moves off]"
230,8,1,Stan Marsh,What?
231,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[reaches a well and holds his nunchucks over it] Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything."
232,8,1,Eric Cartman,"[with his sais] Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!"
233,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back."
234,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!"
235,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try."
236,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Screw you, fatass! [struggles to loosen his grip on the nunchucks]"
237,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true. [Kyle continues struggling and begins to grunt] Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle. [closeup of Cartman's lips] Do it. [Kyle struggles even harder, but eventually gives in]"
238,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up next to Stan] I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
239,8,1,Stan Marsh,"It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them."
240,8,1,Vet,"Come on. Come on, little fella. 'Atta boy. [Butters appears at the other end of the leash, crawling in]"
241,8,1,Butters Stotch,[in a gravelly voice] Woof woof. [babbles incoherently. The veterinarian leads him towards a cell]
242,8,1,Vet,"Right over here. [opens the gate] Good dog. Come on. [guides Butters in] There you go, right in there. [closes the gate and locks it, then leaves] Goooood dog. [Butters babbles some more as a dog approaches from his left and sniffs. The dog pisses on him and walks away. Butters' voice rises in protest. Another dog approaches from his right, sniffs him, and pisses on him. Butters' voice rises a bit more in protest. A third dog approaches from his left, turns around, and craps on him. Butters stands up]"
243,8,1,Butters Stotch,Gaaaah!
244,8,1,Assistant,Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?
245,8,1,Vet,"It just makes me sick how some people can treat animals. [pulls out a large syringe, quickly] Well, nothing we can do for it; let's put it to sleep, shall we? [they move back into Butters' cell] Here you go, pup. I've got a sweet dose of murder for you. What the? Blasted! He's escaped! ...Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs."
246,8,1,Stan Marsh,"All right, the county fair's still open! [they spot Roger, shown in anime form, and approach his booth.]"
247,8,1,Roger,Can I help you boys?
248,8,1,Stan Marsh,We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
249,8,1,Roger,"Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds."
250,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Listen, douche! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!"
251,8,1,Roger,I thought you told me your parents were dead.
252,8,1,Craig Tucker,[approaches with his boys] You guys! [the other boys turn around] You guys!
253,8,1,Stan Marsh,"What is it, Craig?"
254,8,1,Craig Tucker,It's Butters! We saw him!
255,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Where?!
256,8,1,Craig Tucker,Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
257,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,Then it's not too late!
258,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Ninjas! [the boys make their way across the fairgrounds, but freeze in their tracks upon seeing the auction]"
259,8,1,Barker,"[in anime form] All right, folks, our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp."
260,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there."
261,8,1,Craig Tucker,Butters is right on the other side.
262,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,We have to get past them!
263,8,1,Eric Cartman,All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
264,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,You have that power too?
265,8,1,Eric Cartman,"I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold. [steps aside and holds his arms up. He sweeps them down and disappears. He them removes his clothes and gathers them into a pile] This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. [walks over to Stan and hands his clothes over] Here, hold this stuff for me."
266,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Good luck, Bulrog. [Cartman leaves, with only his footsteps indicating where he's going]"
267,8,1,Barker,"Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming. [Cartman, in normal form, appears, tip-toeing across the stage sideways. His penis can be seen.] It has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base. This is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique. [Cartman changes his gait and tip-toes forward. The bidders look on] The lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars."
268,8,1,Barker,"[Cartman changes his gait and tip-toes along sideways. One of the staffers notices Cartman and taps his colleague. The colleague looks and gasps] So we're gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five. Do I, do I hear three hundred and seventy five? [Cartman continues tip-toeing along and the bidders sit motionless. Eight seconds pass before Cartman stops, realizing that the crowd can indeed see him.] Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'? [Cartman looks around, knowing he's stuck.]"
269,8,1,Butters Stotch,"[wanders on stage] Haba, haba! Habahoaha! [babbles some more, then falls flat on his back again]"
270,8,1,Linda Stotch,[rises with her hands on her chest] Butters! [the auction staff encircles the boy]
271,8,1,Randy Marsh,What happened to him?
272,8,1,Sheila Broflovski,Oh my God!
273,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, Jesus."
274,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh dude, we are gonna get it now."
275,8,1,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened. [the boys' parents are present, with angry faces on] But let's try to speak one at a time."
276,8,1,Man 1,"Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!"
277,8,1,Townsfolk,[amid chatter] Yeah! I agree!
278,8,1,Gerald Brofloski,This is the worst thing that's happened in this town! [Butters is shown with a patch over his left eye and a long gauze wrapped around his head to keep the patch in place] The worst thing!
279,8,1,Man 2,"Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage! [the adults go into an uproar again]"
280,8,1,Stan Marsh,What?
281,8,1,Eric Cartman,What?
282,8,1,Skeeter,"Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!"
283,8,1,Sheila Broflovski,This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! [the adults go into an uproar again]
284,8,1,Mr Garrison,"[next to Mr. Mackey] You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!"
285,8,1,Eric Cartman,I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. [the adults go into an uproar again]
286,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?"
287,8,1,Stan Marsh,"Just run with it, dude."
288,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks around, then stands on his chair] Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. Cartman should be punished!"
289,8,1,Man,Yeah! [the adults go into an uproar again]
290,8,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, fuck you, Kyle!"
291,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I c- I can't believe it."
292,8,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
293,8,1,Kyle Broflovski,[pulls out his nunchucks] So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
294,8,1,Stan Marsh,"[he and Kenny pull out their weapons] Yeah. Come on, ninjas. [they transform into their anime forms] We've got some more work to do."
295,8,1,The Boys,"[leap into a pose, and the image is frozen] Hya!"
