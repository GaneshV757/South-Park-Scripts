0,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Hey fellas.
1,8,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy."
2,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmy!
3,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[carries a brochure under his right arm] Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver."
4,8,2,Eric Cartman,[approaches Jimmy] The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
5,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
6,8,2,Eric Cartman,[snickers] What?
7,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,[hands Cartman the brochure] Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
8,8,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on."
9,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that'd be cool."
10,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year."
11,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys."
12,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmy! [he and Jimmy walk off.]
13,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement."
14,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"...You're an asshole, Cartman."
15,8,2,Eric Cartman,What? What'd I do?
16,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,S-s-six!
17,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah.
18,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,S-s-s-ssseven!
19,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah. Timmah!
20,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,S-s-seven!
21,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah! Timmah!
22,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[gets back on count, but falters] Ni- I can- I can't! [Timmy helps Jimmy put the weights back on the bar rest] Huff. Oh man. [sits up] Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year. [another kid at a nearby bench press laughs] All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven reps. Oh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room."
23,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah. [Jimmy walks away]
24,8,2,Francis,"Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday."
25,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[turns and looks] You too, Francis. [looks forward and resumes walking. In a darkened hallway stands a big athlete with an air of hauteur about him]"
26,8,2,Nathan,Hey Jimmy.
27,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh he-hey, N-Nathan."
28,8,2,Nathan,"So uh, I see you train pretty hard."
29,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[moves into the hallway and faces Nathan] Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away."
30,8,2,Nathan,"Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts."
31,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,What kind of shortcuts?
32,8,2,Nathan,You know. Steroids.
33,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,S-s-ss-s-s-steroids? [Nathan signals him to be quite as another handicapped athlete walks by] ...But aren't those illegal?
34,8,2,Nathan,"Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests."
35,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?"
36,8,2,Nathan,[holds out a prescription bottle] You just take one of these little blue babies [holds up three fingers] three times a day [reaches into a fanny pack and pulls out a syringe] and inject this directly into your bloodstream [holds up two fingers] twice a day before meals.
37,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,How much would this cost me?
38,8,2,Nathan,"Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas."
39,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[looks around uneasily] Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a performance."
40,8,2,Nathan,"Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend. [steps closer] Whatever you say. [Jimmy reaches out for the drugs]"
41,8,2,Eric Cartman,[rushes up with the brochure] You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
42,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,What?
43,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" [he looks at his friends as his jaw drops]"
44,8,2,Stan Marsh,So?
45,8,2,Eric Cartman,"So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!"
46,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no. Cartman, no!"
47,8,2,Eric Cartman,"It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!"
48,8,2,Stan Marsh,"That's really, really terrible, dude."
49,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. [walks off]"
50,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,[moves and catches up to Cartman] Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
51,8,2,Eric Cartman,Why?
52,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,Because! [takes away the brochure]
53,8,2,Eric Cartman,"What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?! [points an accusing finger at him] Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale! [lowers it] Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle! [turns around and walks off. Kyle seethes in silence. Cartman now talks to himself] All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is."
54,8,2,Eric Cartman,Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics. [loosens the chin straps and lowers his face to normal] Bull's eye!
55,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second! [heads for his duffel bag and hauls it to his night stand. The knock is heard again]
56,8,2,Dad,Jimmy?
57,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[sweeps the steroids into the bag] Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming. [rushes to the closet and shoves the duffle bag in.]"
58,8,2,Dad,"Jim, it's your father!"
59,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,[walking towards the door] I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second! [realizes he still has the syringe in his mouth] Hold it. [and spits it out. He opens the door and sees his father with a cup of coffee.]
60,8,2,Dad,"Jimmy, were you masturbating?"
61,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"N-no, Dad."
62,8,2,Dad,"Okay. Well, you have a visitor. [the camera pans down to a pretty girl, who enters the room]"
63,8,2,Girl,Hi Jimmy.
64,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy."
65,8,2,Nancy,I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.
66,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.
67,8,2,Dad,"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim."
68,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week."
69,8,2,Dad,"I'll leave you two alone. [reaches for the door, but stops] Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were."
70,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Dad, Jesus C-Christ!"
71,8,2,Dad,"Okay, then. [they look at each other]"
72,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey. [the boys stop and look] Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr."
73,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,[low voice] God damn you!
74,8,2,Eric Cartman,"You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away. [This means it's Tuesday prior] I'm going to go sign up now."
75,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No you're not! [whips out the brochure] I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics."
76,8,2,Eric Cartman,What?! [takes the brochure back from Kyle]
77,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! [grins confidently. Cartman looks at him, then at the brochure and reads]"
78,8,2,Eric Cartman,Moooommmm?
79,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Yes, hon? [begins writing a check]"
80,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Um, could I get you to do something for me?"
81,8,2,Liane Cartman,"What's that, hon?"
82,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? [Liane looks up and goes pale]"
83,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... ""special"" children."
84,8,2,Eric Cartman,I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
85,8,2,Liane Cartman,"You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. [writes out another check]"
86,8,2,Eric Cartman,...I'll split the money with you. [Liane stops]
87,8,2,Liane Cartman,"...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. [Cartman is upset and begins to think a little harder]"
88,8,2,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to the table] All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth. [under his breath] God, this is gonna be hard to say. [normally] I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change. [looks up at her with longing] Help me change?"
89,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow."
90,8,2,Eric Cartman,Awesome.
91,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving."
92,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah!
93,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?"
94,8,2,Timmy Burch,"[slips on his sweater] Timmah! [reaches over for the bag and grabs a handle. The contents spill out, since he didn't grab the other handle, and he sees the steroids drop to the floor. He looks down sadly and holds the bag a litle closer. Jimmy is frozen in place. Timmy's voice shakes] Tim- Timmy?"
95,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later? [sweeps the steroids back into the bag. Timmy finds a bottle on his pants and looks at it. Jimmy finishes up and leaves] I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim."
96,8,2,Timmy Burch,[turns and exclaims] Timmah... [the tone of voice stops Jimmy]
97,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[turns] Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!"
98,8,2,Timmy Burch,[rolls up to Jimmy] Timmah. Timmah!
99,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!"
100,8,2,Timmy Burch,[turns aside and sighs] Timmah. [rolls away a bit] T-T-Timmah.
101,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?"
102,8,2,Timmy Burch,Huh! Timmah! T-Timmah!
103,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!"
104,8,2,Timmy Burch,"Timmah! Timmah, Jimmih! [points to himself] Arrrh Timmah! [points to himself] Jimmih!"
105,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
106,8,2,Timmy Burch,[spent] Huh... Timmah... [holds the bottle out over the floor] Timmah.
107,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[angered] S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?! [Timmy drops the bottle on the ground, turns around and rolls away. Jimmy watches him leave] Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world! [looks down at the bottle, then kicks the bottle away with his left crutch] Fuck!"
108,8,2,Timmy Burch,Timmah! [rolls forward and throws the javelin] Aaar-yaaaaah Timmah! [the javelin hits the ground near a coach]
109,8,2,Coach,"All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up!"
110,8,2,Timmy Burch,Oowrrr! Timmah! Livilaye!
111,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,[runs down a track for the long jump] Y-yeess! [jumps into the air and lands]Grrrr!
112,8,2,Coach 2,"Wuh-wow, Jimmy, I can't believe how much you've improved! You're bigger and stronger than I've ever seen you!"
113,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard."
114,8,2,Coach 2,You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday!
115,8,2,Man,"Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?"
116,8,2,Volunteer,Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized.
117,8,2,Woman,Thank you very much.
118,8,2,Volunteer,"Thank you! Good luck, Michael."
119,8,2,Michael,Thanks.
120,8,2,Volunteer,"Okay, next in line please?"
121,8,2,Eric Cartman,"[looking really retarded, steps up to the table with his mom] Naaaa! Daaaaa!"
122,8,2,Volunteer,Hello there.
123,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please."
124,8,2,Eric Cartman,Naaaa!
125,8,2,Volunteer,"Oh, great! What's his name?"
126,8,2,Liane Cartman,Eric Cartman...
127,8,2,Eric Cartman,Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
128,8,2,Volunteer,Okay. Age?
129,8,2,Liane Cartman,He's nine.
130,8,2,Volunteer,"O-kay, and what's his disability?"
131,8,2,Liane Cartman,"...Um, he's retarded. [Cartman offers a retarded grin]"
132,8,2,Volunteer,"...N-no, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy?"
133,8,2,Liane Cartman,"Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure. [Cartman looks up with some concern] Sweetie, what is your condition?"
134,8,2,Eric Cartman,...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
135,8,2,Volunteer,I'll just leave that blank for now.
136,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[performs the injection] Yeah, b-bigger, stronger! [Timmy rolls by and hears him, then raises his eyes in alarm]"
137,8,2,Mr Mackey,"[opens the door] Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in. [Timmy follows Mr. Mackey in] I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay?"
138,8,2,Timmy Burch,[leans forward and begins] Timmy.
139,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it."
140,8,2,Timmy Burch,[sighs and begins again] Timmy.
141,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem?"
142,8,2,Timmy Burch,"[shakes his head vigorously] No Timmy, Jimmy."
143,8,2,Mr Mackey,Ji-Jimmy?
144,8,2,Timmy Burch,"[showing his frustration] Haaa! [remembers something] Oh, oh! [wheels over to a class picture of the fourth graders. Jimmy is at one end of the front row, with Mr. Garrison behind him. Timmy reaches up and points] Jimmy."
145,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?"
146,8,2,Timmy Burch,"[rolls back and tries to get the story out with gestures. He demonstrates Jimmy asking for his bag] Timmah! Timmah, uh, Jimmih. [demonstrates himself handing the bag to Jimmy and seeing the contents fall out] Hey Timmy, Timmah Tim-oh! Tim-Timmah! [shows his reaction to the steroids] Timmmah? Jimmih! Jimmih. [demonstrates the argument between the two] Jimmih Timmah Timmah? Timmah, Timmah! Jimmih... Jimmih! Jimmih! Timmah! [demonstrates the bottle being dropped] Timmah!"
147,8,2,Mr Mackey,"[confused] Mmmmm'kaaay. I don't quite follow, Timmy."
148,8,2,Timmy Burch,Argh. Jimmy...
149,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Right, Jimmy Valmer."
150,8,2,Timmy Burch,"Uh. [demonstrates himself minding his own business when he sees Jimmy shooting up in the shadows], Timmah Jimmih Jimmih Jim- [demonstrates the injection, then flexes his muscles and takes a sinister tone] Jimmh Timmah Timmah Jimmih!"
151,8,2,Mr Mackey,"Right. He's Jimmy, yeah."
152,8,2,Timmy Burch,[really frustrated] Haaaaaaaaaah!
153,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Enter. [Kyle enters, and walks up next to Cartman]"
154,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. [they look at each other and Cartman closes a book he had open for reference]"
155,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Go on, Kyle."
156,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!"
157,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew."
158,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!"
159,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul."
160,8,2,Kyle Broflovski,I came here to talk about you!
161,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Yes. [hops off his seat and consoles Kyle] And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle. [whispers] Good luck. [after a few seconds, Kyle turns around and goes to leave. He opens the door, turns around to say something but instead walks out. Cartman just hums a tune, goes back to the computer and reads some more.]"
162,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Come on, push it! Push it! [he pushes the weights onto the bar rest and sits up. He checks his musculature out in the mirror] Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. [the door opens and Nancy enters]"
163,8,2,Nancy,"Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop."
164,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time."
165,8,2,Nancy,I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time.
166,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Oh Jesus! [lays back down and takes up the weights] You gonna start running your mouth off again? [begins new reps] P-push it! Push it!
167,8,2,Nancy,"Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different."
168,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,They-they're all just... jealous.
169,8,2,Nancy,You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you.
170,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[quickly rests the weights and sits up] You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!"
171,8,2,Nancy,You can't treat people like this!
172,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[gets up and walks over to Nancy, then begins beating her with his crutches. She wails] I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?! [he grabs her by the throat and throws her head against the floor a few times, then whacks her on the side of the head a few times.] You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told! [resumes beating her. His mom opens the door to see what's the matter]"
173,8,2,Sarah Valmer,"What the? [tries to stop the beating] Jimmy, oh my God!"
174,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[throws his mother off and heads for the door] Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches! [walks down the hall, hits the walk with his right crutch, and breaks down.] No! God! [collapses on his back and bawls]"
175,8,2,Host,"Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special Olympics! [the crowd cheers. The boys are there, as promised] We will be holding various throughout the day, and at the end of it all we will have some very special celebrity athletes here to present the trophy for top athlete, along with the cash prize of one thousand dollars."
176,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[flexes his right bicep] Top athlete, yeah!"
177,8,2,Eric Cartman,"One thousand dollars, yeah!"
178,8,2,Host,So let's have all our athletes report to their first assigned events and... Let the Games begin! [The crowd cheers wildly]
179,8,2,Announcer,Will those athletes in heat 1 of the hundred-meter dash please report to Track Area B.
180,8,2,Volunteer 2,"Okay, racers, are we ready? [raises her firing pistol] Take your marks."
181,8,2,Eric Cartman,[hobbles into the fifth position on the track] Daaaa! Daaaa!
182,8,2,Volunteer 2,On your marks! Get set! Go! [the runners take off. Cartman quickly falls behind]
183,8,2,Eric Cartman,Whoa. What the hell?? [the girl in position 6 breaks the tape. Cartman hobbles past the finish line four seconds later]
184,8,2,Volunteer 2,"Great job, everyone. [points to the runners who were in positions 6, 2, and 4] You three advance to the next heat. [the group leaves]"
185,8,2,Winner,All right!
186,8,2,Blond Boy,Good Job.
187,8,2,Blonde Girl,We did it!
188,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events."
189,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,Yeeessss! [walks back and forth happily] Yes! Yes!
190,8,2,Announcer,"He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics record, folks! [Timmy is understandably unimpressed and pissed off]"
191,8,2,Eric Cartman,[trips over a hurdle] God-damnit!
192,8,2,Announcer,"Winner, Jimmy Valmer! [Jimmy flexes his left arm and scrambles out of the water. Timmy is more pissed off]"
193,8,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, this one I can win! [drops his pole, takes off his helmet and gives it to another athlete] Here, hold this! [takes up his pole and aims] I'll show you Goddamned retards! [runs up to the posts, plants his pole, and sails up, but the pole won't straighten out. It flexes a few time before it breaks, sending Cartman back down to the track, where he lands on his back]"
194,8,2,Eric Cartman,God-damnit!
195,8,2,Announcer,That's another Special Olympics record!
196,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[raises his arms and crutches up in victory] Yeah! Yeah! [turns around] Yeah, I did it! [turns around] Yeah! Yeah!"
197,8,2,Host,"Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end, and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004! Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds. [the three players come out and walk to the podium. All of them are buff]"
198,8,2,Barry Bonds,The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer.
199,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[raises up his left arm and crutch] Yeah! Fuck yeah! [Timmy sits nearby with his arms crossed, glaring at Jimmy. Jimmy walks up to the podium] Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best! [Bonds hands Jimmy the medal. The host returns to the podium]"
200,8,2,Host,"Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!"
201,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Ah, screw you hippies!"
202,8,2,Host,"For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!"
203,8,2,Eric Cartman,"...I could pile at Shakey's, heck. [puts on his helmet and walks up] Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!"
204,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[confronts Cartman] Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?!"
205,8,2,Eric Cartman,"[humbly] Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh."
206,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?! [grabs Cartman by the collar] I should kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!"
207,8,2,Timmy Burch,[approaches] Timmah!
208,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,What?
209,8,2,Timmy Burch,[points to Jimmy] Timmah!
210,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"[thinks a moment] Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right. [walks up to the mic and begins talking]"
211,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Everyone, can I have your attention, please? [everyone falls silent] I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting. [a shot of Nancy, injured and taped around the head. She smiles] A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him. [a shot of Timmy, who smiles and shows off his silver medal. Others around him wear bronzes.] Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics. [a shot of a chastened Cartman before the baseball players]"
212,8,2,Jimmy Valmer,"Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a [shot of Mark McGuire] big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say, [shot of Barry Bonds] ""Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- "" [shot of Jason Giambi] ""-steroid-taking jackass."" [Giambi nods ever so subtly] That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor. [applause rises from the stands, followed by cheers. The volunteers and baseball players gather around Jimmy]"
213,8,2,Mark McGuire,Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.
214,8,2,Eric Cartman,"Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids. [he looks at Kyle and then Stan for a reaction, but neither offers any. He frowns, then steps forward angrily] Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes! [straightens up] Grow up! [walks off in a huff]"
