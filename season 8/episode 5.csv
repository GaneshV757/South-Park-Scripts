0,8,5,Butters Stotch,What the heck?
1,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Whoa! What a huge package! [finds it, the shipping label reads]"
2,8,5,Butters Stotch,To Butters Stotch. Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me! [returns to the crate's label]
3,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Who is it from? ""Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa."" [skips around] Wow! A package for me from Japan!!"
4,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11."
5,8,5,Butters Stotch,Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package.
6,8,5,Eric Cartman,[monotone] Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
7,8,5,Butters Stotch,[dazzled] Whoa...
8,8,5,Eric Cartman,I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
9,8,5,Butters Stotch,[approaches AWESOM-O] You... you're my robot?
10,8,5,Eric Cartman,Yes. I will be your new best friend.
11,8,5,Butters Stotch,Oh wow!
12,8,5,Butters Stotch,Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.
13,8,5,Butters Stotch,Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.
14,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Heheh, they're all so jealous! [He hops onto the bed next to Cartman.] I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have."
15,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff."
16,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh? [strokes his chin] Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesitated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter."
17,8,5,Eric Cartman,[snickers] Really?
18,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school. [Cartman begins to chuckle] You okay, AWESOM-O?"
19,8,5,Eric Cartman,Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
20,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum."
21,8,5,Eric Cartman,"[laughs] That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets."
22,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Hm, okay. Let's see [strokes his chin] Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff."
23,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, really?"
24,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days."
25,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Heh. Wow, that sucks."
26,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me."
27,8,5,Eric Cartman,Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
28,8,5,Butters Stotch,"No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! [hops off and walks towards his desk.]"
29,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you."
30,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!"
31,8,5,Eric Cartman,What?
32,8,5,Butters Stotch,"When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake."
33,8,5,Eric Cartman,You saw that?
34,8,5,Butters Stotch,Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
35,8,5,Eric Cartman,Nuh uh.
36,8,5,Butters Stotch,I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
37,8,5,Eric Cartman,No way.
38,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!"
39,8,5,Eric Cartman,"[beat] ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?"
40,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?"
41,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?"
42,8,5,Butters Stotch,How come?
43,8,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O."
44,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. [leaves the room]"
45,8,5,Eric Cartman,"[moments later, still on the bed] Oh, son of a bitch!"
46,8,5,Butters Stotch,Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
47,8,5,Butters Stotch,"He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy."
48,8,5,Butters Stotch,My robot friend.
49,8,5,Butters Stotch,I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
50,8,5,Butters Stotch,He's smart as can be and emotion-free
51,8,5,Butters Stotch,"And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend."
52,8,5,Butters Stotch,My robot friend.
53,8,5,Butters Stotch,My robot friend.
54,8,5,Butters Stotch,My robot... friend.
55,8,5,Linda Stotch,"Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot."
56,8,5,Stephen Stotch,[tosses the paper onto the couch arm as Linda serves him coffee] Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. [takes his cup]
57,8,5,Butters Stotch,[leading Cartman to the stairs] That's great AWESOM-O! [Cartman carries a pile of clothes] You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
58,8,5,Linda Stotch,"Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon."
59,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime."
60,8,5,Linda Stotch,"Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?"
61,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?"
62,8,5,Linda Stotch,"That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?"
63,8,5,Eric Cartman,AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
64,8,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah! Don't you know nothin' about robots? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! [Cartman follows Butters upstairs]"
65,8,5,Linda Stotch,"Aw, that's just adorable."
66,8,5,Stephen Stotch,It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
