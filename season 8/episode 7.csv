0,8,7,Woman,Yes?
1,8,7,Eric Cartman,[sweetly] Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
2,8,7,Woman,"Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?"
3,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!"
4,8,7,Woman,How about fifteen dollars?
5,8,7,Eric Cartman,"It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work! [moments later, Stan and Kyle are clearing the driveway while Kenny clears the front lawn, moving by Cartman, who is now seated on the steps talking on a cell phone] Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. [Kyle walks up to him and stops] No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak. [notices Kyle, then lowers the phone] What?"
6,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
7,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, I'm takin' a break."
8,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
9,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers."
10,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,All you ever do is talk about your balls!
11,8,7,Eric Cartman,"It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?"
12,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,"If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!"
13,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!"
14,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?"
15,8,7,Woman,"Oh goodness, what happened?"
16,8,7,Eric Cartman,Shoveling accident.
17,8,7,Woman,"Oooh, no, come on inside. [leads them in and stops in the middle of the living room, in front of the TV. A newscast is on] Wait right here, I'll be right back. [walks off]"
18,8,7,Eric Cartman,"You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it."
19,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, just keep your mouth shut."
20,8,7,News Announcer,This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown. [the boys turn to watch]
21,8,7,Aaron Brown,"[CNN anchor. An image of the humanoid is shown, with the caption ""Guest from the Future"" above it] Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car."
22,8,7,Stan Marsh,Whoa.
23,8,7,Aaron Brown,Christina Naylon has more.
24,8,7,Christina Naylon,"[soldiers patrol the area around Hangar 18] The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?"
25,8,7,Aaron Brown,"Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad?"
26,8,7,Brad Morgan,"[inside the base. Scientists and soldiers mill around the alien's bed] Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Uh, he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh, to find a job here."
27,8,7,Aaron Brown,"Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work?"
28,8,7,Brad Morgan,"Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi- his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundreds of dollars, but uh, enough, he says, to feed his family."
29,8,7,Aaron Brown,"And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison?"
30,8,7,Harrison Moore,"[at the time portal. News vans, reporters and scientists, one in a space suit, gather around and marvel at the portal] Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay."
31,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!"
32,8,7,Randy Marsh,"We know, Stanley. We've been watching."
33,8,7,Aaron Brown,"If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time."
34,8,7,Harrison Moore,"Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived! [the camera pans right to show a HazMat team checking the person for radiation] It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family."
35,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"There you go. All set, sweetie?"
36,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em."
37,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep. [turns off Stan's lamp] You've had a busy day. [walks off. At the door she turns and looks at him] Goodnight, sweetie."
38,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Night, Mom. [after she leaves, he puts his arms up and behind his head and smiles] Wow, two people from the future. How cool."
39,8,7,Mrs Landis,Yes?
40,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?"
41,8,7,Mrs Landis,"Ooh, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it."
42,8,7,Eric Cartman,What?! Who?!
43,8,7,Mrs Landis,One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.
44,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
45,8,7,Stan Marsh,"All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. [the boys turn to go back to the sidewalk...]"
46,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. [the camera pulls back to show these immigrants shoveling snow off sidewalks and driveways up and down the street]
47,8,7,Stan Marsh,Son of a bitch!
48,8,7,Aaron Brown,"Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?"
49,8,7,Chris Holt,"[seated to Brown's left] Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. I- it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races. They are all one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish whitish color. Uh, it seems race is no longer an issue in the future, because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language. The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this: [makes three guttural sounds] Back to you, Aaron."
50,8,7,Aaron Brown,"Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America."
51,8,7,Man 1,"[left side, front row] This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!"
52,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"[at the podium] All right, folks, my name is Darryl Weathers and I'm with the Construction Workers' Union. I work with a lot of fine men who have families to feed. Now, I don't know about you all, but we worked long and hard to get our pay up to a level where we could make a decent living. And now these people from the future are showin' up and offerin' to do the same work for next to nothin'! They took our jobs! [the audience, which is unemployed, clamors in agreement]"
53,8,7,Man 2,"[rises, wears dark blue short-sleeve shirt, black pants] We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs!"
54,8,7,Man 3,They took your jobs! [the rest of the audience clamors]
55,8,7,Man 4,Well what about us in the fast-food business?! The restaurants are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less! They took our jobs!
56,8,7,Other Men,[at random times] They took your jobs!
57,8,7,Stan Marsh,"[pipes up] It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too! [silence] Oh, they took our jobs!"
58,8,7,Other Men,[at random times] They took yer jobs!
59,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?"
60,8,7,Stan Marsh,I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to- [an immigrant descends the stairs with a basket of dirty clothes and stops to ask Sharon something using guttural sounds]
61,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? [the immigrant makes some guttural sounds and walks away]"
62,8,7,Stan Marsh,[leery] Who is that?
63,8,7,Randy Marsh,"That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays. [aside] And she'll do it for ten cents an hour."
64,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!"
65,8,7,Sharon Marsh,What?!
66,8,7,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God! [he and Sharon rise, Stan backs away a bit] Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!"
67,8,7,Sharon Marsh,Who taught you to talk like that?!
68,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away."
69,8,7,Randy Marsh,They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
70,8,7,Stan Marsh,I wanted my job!
71,8,7,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!"
72,8,7,Sharon Marsh,That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
73,8,7,Stan Marsh,Timecist?
74,8,7,Sharon Marsh,"You know, a racist, but against people from the-"
75,8,7,Stan Marsh,"People from the future. Right, got it."
76,8,7,Randy Marsh,"All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking."
77,8,7,Announcer,"And now, here is Bill O'Reilly."
78,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"Welcome, welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right? And what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future. All right? Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it. All right? But others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off. All right? Now, I've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter. On my right is pissed-off, white-trash, redneck conservative."
79,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Thanks for having me, Bill."
80,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"And on my left is aging, hippie, liberal douche."
81,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,Hello.
82,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal, all right?"
83,8,7,Darryl Weathers,You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans! [leans in and low and almost grunts] They took our jobs!
84,8,7,Skynard Man,They took our jobs!
85,8,7,Darryl Weathers,Those jobs belong to people from the present!
86,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"All right. What say you, aging hippie liberal douche?"
87,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"Heh, it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away?"
88,8,7,Bill O Reilly,"All right, redneck, your rebuttal?"
89,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"[says nothing, then rises, leans forward and low, and almost grunts] They took our jobs!"
90,8,7,Skynard Man,They took our jobs!
91,8,7,Stout Man,[really slurring] Too-kourderb!
92,8,7,Herbert Garrison,"All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak."
93,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
94,8,7,Herbert Garrison,"So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs. Remember that there are transitive verbs such as [writes on the board] ""The boy threw the red ball,"" which in Futurespeak of course, is [makes a sentence of grunts and guttural sounds] Everyone say it with me? [the kids repeat the sentence, which sounds like a series of barks, coming from them. Jimmy attempts it] Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as [writes on the board] ""The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late."" Or in Futurespeak, ""Vvut."""
95,8,7,The Kids,"""Vvut."""
96,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!"
97,8,7,Craig Tucker,Yeah!
98,8,7,Stan Marsh,That's right! [other students speak up]
99,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,"[steps in] Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture. Who are we to say our language is best? They deserve to have an education just as much as you do."
100,8,7,Herbert Garrison,"Thank you, aging, hippie, liberal douche."
101,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,You betcha. [steps out]
102,8,7,Timmy Burch,Timmih.
103,8,7,Herbert Garrison,"Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this? [writes on the board] ""The sad girl puts balls in her mouth."" Or, in Futurespeak of course, ""Gluch gligh balls glych gligh."""
104,8,7,Man 5,This is bullcrap!
105,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman. [unfurls a letter] ""Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane."""
106,8,7,Chet,What? That's ridiculous!
107,8,7,Man 6,They can't do that!
108,8,7,Man 7,That was a good idea!
109,8,7,Darryl Weathers,So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening!
110,8,7,Man 8,"Hey, that's right! If there is no future, then there'll be no people from the future to come back and take our jobs!"
111,8,7,Man 9,Take r jurbs
112,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening?"
113,8,7,Chet,"How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and it ushers in a new ice age?"
114,8,7,Darryl Weathers,[pause] How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?!
115,8,7,Chet,"Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'?"
116,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like?"
117,8,7,Chet,Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.
118,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs!"
119,8,7,Many Men,[randomly] They took our jobs!
120,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, dude."
121,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,Gaur da'ka?
122,8,7,Stan Marsh,Can you speak in present-day English please?
123,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,Uh oh... Can I help... you?
124,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries."
125,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,"[looks at the boys quizzically, then shows off the chicken sandwich to his left] Chicken sandwich?"
126,8,7,Stan Marsh,"[getting annoyed] No, a double cheeseburger and fries!"
127,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,[taps away at the machine's keyboard] A cheeg- fry?
128,8,7,Stan Marsh,What?!
129,8,7,Wendell's Cashier,A cheeg- fry?
130,8,7,Eric Cartman,"We can't understand you, asshole! [the cashier's manager comes up and talks to him for a bit. The cashier points at the boys. The manager takes over and resets the order]"
131,8,7,Wendell's Manager,Can I help you?
132,8,7,Stan Marsh,I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
133,8,7,Wendell's Manager,[shows off the chicken sandwich to his left] Chicken sandwich?
134,8,7,Stan Marsh,"No, it's not a chicken sandwich! [his parents enter the restaurant and stand in line behind him and the boys] I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!"
135,8,7,Randy Marsh,Stan Marsh!
136,8,7,Stan Marsh,Aw- awwww!
137,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs!"
138,8,7,Man 1,"Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should all take off all our clothes, scramble into a big pile and start gettin' gay with each other."
139,8,7,Chet,"Did you say ""get gay""?"
140,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Hey, yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!"
141,8,7,Man 11,What? Gettin' gay?
142,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs!"
143,8,7,Jimbo Kern,I ain't turnin' queer.
144,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"You have to, Jimbo, or else we won't be able to stop them! They took 'r jaobs!"
145,8,7,Man 2,"Yeah, they took our jobs!"
146,8,7,Man 8,[slurring] Took our jobs!
147,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"[begins to take off his clothes till he's in briefs and boots] Let's go over to that part of town that all the future people moved into and start humpin' each other until they disappear! Come on! [comes down from the podium and makes his way to the doors. His briefs fall off, and he turns around] Come on! You want your jobs back or not?! [turns around, walks out and turns right]"
148,8,7,Darryl Weathers,"[appears with the other rally participants, all of them naked] All right, you future bastards! Think you can take our jubs?! Well, we'll show you! Come'ere, Earl!. [the burly man wearing the Skynard hat steps forth and starts making out with Weathers] How do you like that, gooback?! [the immigrants just stare back puzzled. Weathers addresses the rest of his peers] Come on, you guys! [the other men just stare for a while, then begin to make out as well. The immigrants just look at them.] Everyone who believes in America, join in with us! We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent!"
149,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?"
150,8,7,Randy Marsh,"Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth! [Randy opens the door and they both go inside. The office walls are now brown instead of gray. Randy closes the door and motions Stanley to a chair behind it] You just sit right there, Stanley, and you think about what you've done! [puts his coat on the coat rack and sits at his desk to begin his day]"
151,8,7,Boss,You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh-
152,8,7,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Mr. Nelson."
153,8,7,Mr Nelson,"Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here."
154,8,7,Randy Marsh,Why? This is my office.
155,8,7,Mr Nelson,"Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooh, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced."
156,8,7,Randy Marsh,What?
157,8,7,Mr Nelson,"Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk."
158,8,7,Mr Glughgogawk,Gheglo.
159,8,7,Randy Marsh,You can't be serious.
160,8,7,Mr Nelson,"I'm... sorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some time to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room. [walks away with the immigrant. Randy is left alone to contemplate his next move]"
161,8,7,Randy Marsh,Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
162,8,7,Stan Marsh,They took yer jarb!!
163,8,7,Announcer,This is CNN.
164,8,7,Aaron Brown,Breaking news at the time border. We go now live to Harrison Moore.
165,8,7,Harrison Moore,"Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out. [more immigrants enter through the portal] Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another. [a shot of all the men in a big pile, in all sorts of positions, as news crews film them] These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh. [Randy steps into view, patting his moustache down] Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?"
166,8,7,Randy Marsh,"We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands. [another camera view shows Stan next to his father. Stan tries to block out this interview with eyes shut tight and his fingers on his nose] We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!"
167,8,7,Darryl Weathers,Yeah America! [A close-up of the mass of men fornicating with each other]
168,8,7,Man 8,Take our jobs!
169,8,7,Harrison Moore,Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?
170,8,7,Randy Marsh,"All we can do is try, Harrison."
171,8,7,Aging Hippie Liberal Douche,[walks into the picture] Trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant. Those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness.
172,8,7,Harrison Moore,"[lowers the mic to Stan] Young man, what do you think about all this?"
173,8,7,Stan Marsh,"I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us. [loosens up and opens his eyes] They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. [the mound of men stops copulating]"
174,8,7,Man 9,[at the top of the mound] Huh?
175,8,7,Stan Marsh,"I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work."
176,8,7,Man 11,"[inside the mound] Hey. He's right. If we build for a better future, the immigrants will stay there."
177,8,7,Man 12,Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow.
178,8,7,Randy Marsh,Well what are we waiting for?
179,8,7,Singer,"We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me."
180,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Look, it's working! [one by one, the immigrants vanish from view]"
181,8,7,Singer,The future begins with you and me.
182,8,7,Darryl Weathers,The immigrants are fadin' away!
183,8,7,Stan Marsh,We're doing it!
184,8,7,Singer,"We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future-"
185,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second. [drops his shovel] This is gay."
186,8,7,Kyle Broflovski,[drops his shovel] This is really gay.
187,8,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other."
188,8,7,Stan Marsh,"Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile. [everyone races back to the pile. The men take off their clothes]"
189,8,7,Darryl Weathers,Back in the pile everyone!
190,8,7,Randy Marsh,We're going back to the pile.
191,8,7,Man 13,Jump in!
192,8,7,Man 14,"Come on, everybody!"
193,8,7,Man 15,"Never mind, we're going back to the pile!"
194,8,7,Man 16,Took yer jurb!
