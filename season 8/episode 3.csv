0,8,3,Eric Cartman,[in the driver's seat] Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
1,8,3,Stan Marsh,Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
2,8,3,Eric Cartman,"What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?"
3,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm a Vulcan!
4,8,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?"
5,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[looking into an imaginary viewer] The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing."
6,8,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, hang on. We're about to land. [the boys make landing noises, with Stan finishing off with a thump. Cartman removes his seatbelt] Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here."
7,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,No! I'm on the away team too! [he and Kenny remove their belts]
8,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[looks back] It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!"
9,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
10,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible."
11,8,3,Eric Cartman,Set phasers on stun.
12,8,3,Stan Marsh,Things seem pretty quiet.
13,8,3,Eric Cartman,Yes. A little too quiet.
14,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. [Cartman sighs silently]
15,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it! [the boys take their positions and start firing away] Oh no, it got Kyle!"
16,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,[stops firing and stands still] No it doesn't. [the other boys continue with their phaser noises]
17,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off! [pretends to be the monster ripping Kyle's head off] Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!"
18,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!"
19,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!"
20,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!"
21,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh God, here we go again."
22,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!"
23,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,He does not!
24,8,3,Eric Cartman,"How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it."
25,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,Naw uh!
26,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Go see the movie, Kyle!"
27,8,3,Stan Marsh,That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
28,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Me too!) [they leave]
29,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
30,8,3,Eric Cartman,"You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you."
31,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,People don't hate the Jews!
32,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[focuses Kyle's attention to him] Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson."
33,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,...You're a stupid asshole! [turns and walks off. Cartman turns left and glances at Kyle]
34,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Sweet, now I can just play with myself. [fires off his phaser] Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! [races into the minivan]"
35,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,One please.
36,8,3,Ticket Salesman,This is an R-rated movie.
37,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I know, but I have to-"
38,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it."
39,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"...Thanks. [makes his way towards the doors, glancing back at the cashier in wonder]"
40,8,3,Soldier 1,Hac bashtud Christo.
41,8,3,Soldier 2,Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad.
42,8,3,Jesus,"Wa! [the whipping begins and Jesus screams. This goes on for a long time. Kyle's mouth widens, his eyes get bigger. The next scene, he's got his coat over his mouth and he's almost in a fetal position. The next scene has him turned to his left, grimacing, his hat pulled over his ears as he winces. The next scene has him trembling]"
43,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,Haaaah! [Next scene has Kyle with his eyes squeezed shut and his hands over his face. He's now curled up in a ball]
44,8,3,Jesus,"Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!! [the whipping continues and Kyle dares to peek again. His stomach reacts and he vomits. The next scene has him almost passed out with vomit dribbling from his chin. The film ends and Kyle doesn't move.]"
45,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
46,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?"
47,8,3,Announcer,"And now, back to Terrance and Phillip. [the doorbell rings]"
48,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,"Hey Terrance, I think I have a-"
49,8,3,Eric Cartman,Mom! Doorbell!
50,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. [a second laughter and laughter is heard.]"
51,8,3,Eric Cartman,[the doorbell rings] Mom! Answer the door!
52,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
53,8,3,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, lazy-ass whore. [gets up and answers the door himself.]"
54,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,What?
55,8,3,Terrance and Phillip,Faaart.[Terrance farts. Cartman opens the door and sees Kyle soaking wet from the heavy rain]
56,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know."
57,8,3,Eric Cartman,"It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?"
58,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You were, you were right?"
59,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[closes his eyes and relishes the moment] Mmm, one more time, Kyle."
60,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,You were right. [Cartman opens his eyes and beams brightly]
61,8,3,Eric Cartman,"I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done. [a shot of Mel Gibson's poster, without the ""Braveheart"" on it.] Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen."
62,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now."
63,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Goddamn.)
64,8,3,Stan Marsh,[rises] Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
65,8,3,Stan Marsh,Dude. That movie sucked.
66,8,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it totally sucked!)"
67,8,3,Stan Marsh,How can they even call that a movie?
68,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know!)
69,8,3,Stan Marsh,"That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back."
70,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!) [they leave their seats]
71,8,3,Jack Garrett,"Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was."
72,8,3,Elise Garrett,"Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on! [they walk off, screen left. A second couple emerges]"
73,8,3,Man 1,"[brown shirt, green sweater] I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus."
74,8,3,Woman 1,"[orange blouse, necklace] Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing. [they walk off, screen right. Stan and Kyle come out and approach the window]"
75,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, we want our money back."
76,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Huh?
77,8,3,Stan Marsh,That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
78,8,3,Ticket Salesman,I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie.
79,8,3,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!"
80,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
81,8,3,Stan Marsh,You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
82,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins!"
83,8,3,Stan Marsh,"We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!"
84,8,3,Ticket Salesman,I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
85,8,3,Stan Marsh,W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
86,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Yeah. I'd like to see you try.
87,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! [he and Kenny storm off]"
88,8,3,Priests,"Kill him! Guilty! Kill him! [sketches of a nail driven through the left palm are animated, then a realistic view of Jesus crucified] Kill him! Kill him! Die!"
89,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! [a spear pierces Jesus' side. The one piercing him is Kyle himself, who seems to be relishing this, as he pierces Jesus a few more times. A review of images, then an image of Alan Alda, and Kyle wakes up frightened. After a few screams he looks around]"
90,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go. [clicks on the link] Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! ""For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."" Okay, okay, wait, here we go. [picks up the phone and dials in]"
91,8,3,Eric Cartman,Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
92,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion."
93,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m."
94,8,3,Stan Marsh,"No, no, no, no, we want our money back."
95,8,3,Eric Cartman,What?
96,8,3,Stan Marsh,We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
97,8,3,Eric Cartman,"You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes."
98,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!"
99,8,3,Eric Cartman,"If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick."
100,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!"
101,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!"
102,8,3,Stan Marsh,I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
103,8,3,Eric Cartman,Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
104,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!"
105,8,3,Eric Cartman,"I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!"
106,8,3,Stan Marsh,"[in recognition] Wait a minute. Cartman?! [realizing he's been recognized, Cartman is speechless]"
107,8,3,Eric Cartman,Eup. [hangs up and skulks away]
108,8,3,Stan Marsh,"[packing] Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!"
109,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Malibu? But how?)
110,8,3,Stan Marsh,"We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible! [He leads Kenny out of his room] This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!"
111,8,3,Liane Cartman,"Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?"
112,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did."
113,8,3,Liane Cartman,"Oh, that's great, sweetie."
114,8,3,Eric Cartman,[turns right so his profile will look sharp as well] Tell them I'll be down shortly
115,8,3,Liane Cartman,"Okay, hon."
116,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[wields his short whip]Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. [a shot of the poster.]"
117,8,3,Man 1,"Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?"
118,8,3,Jack Garrett,"No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise."
119,8,3,Elise Garrett,Hello.
120,8,3,Man 2,I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
121,8,3,Elise Garrett,Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
122,8,3,Man 2,And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
123,8,3,Jack Garrett,"Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?"
124,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!"
125,8,3,Woman 2,It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives. [Cartman approaches the dais.]
126,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah, hello everyone. Achtung. [the last few standing people take their seats] My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club. [applause] Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done."
127,8,3,Woman 3,[in pink dress] We sure do. [the crowd voices its approval]
128,8,3,Eric Cartman,"But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. [the guests fall silent]"
129,8,3,Elise Garrett,"[in orange blouse] Wha- what does that mean, sweetie?"
130,8,3,Jack Garrett,"I'm not sure, but- uh. [stands up] Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks. [the crowd voices its approval]"
131,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[bows a few times] Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we [his face turns ugly] all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion."
132,8,3,Man 3,"Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!"
133,8,3,Various Meeting Guests,"Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea."
134,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean."
135,8,3,Ticket Salesman,We sure do!
136,8,3,Various Meeting Guests,Yeah. All right. Woohoo!
137,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Thank you. [looks over his Map To The Stars' Homes] This must be the place. [they walk through a side door right under a guard's nose. He fails to notice them. They walk up the driveway and past the massive fountain] Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. [rings the doorbell. The door opens and Mel appears]"
138,8,3,Mel Gibson,Yes?
139,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny."
140,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hello.)
141,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?"
142,8,3,Mel Gibson,"You can't not like The Passion! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home. [leaves, but the boys follow him in.]"
143,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money."
144,8,3,Mel Gibson,"Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first. [unbuttons his shirt] But I won't tell you where I keep my money. [takes off his shirt] You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!"
145,8,3,Stan Marsh,Tor- torture you?
146,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[removes his pants and socks] Ha! So you do intend to torture me, huh?! [runs up to a torture rack and lies down in it] Well go ahead! Do your worst! [shackles himself in] You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out!"
147,8,3,Stan Marsh,We don't want to torture you.
148,8,3,Mel Gibson,"I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!"
149,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?"
150,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[unshackles himself and walks up to the boys] I have to use that money to build my church! I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church! And do you know why?! So I can play banjo! [whips out a hat and banjo, puts on the hat, and starts playing] Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!"
151,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!"
152,8,3,Mel Gibson,"How dare you call me crazy! This means war! [jumps up and whoops like an Indian, twirls around a few times, and fires off blanks at the boys. Stan and Kenny run]"
153,8,3,Father Maxi,"And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins."
154,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over."
155,8,3,Father Maxi,"...What is troubling you, my child?"
156,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord."
157,8,3,Father Maxi,Ah! You mean he's a Jew!
158,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night."
159,8,3,Father Maxi,"Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews."
160,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,But how can the Jews make it better??
161,8,3,Father Maxi,"Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement."
162,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course. [gets off the chair] I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. [turns and walks out]"
163,8,3,Stan and Kenny,Aaaah!
164,8,3,Mel Gibson,"Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me. [resumes hopping like a mad rabbit]"
165,8,3,Stan Marsh,Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude! [catches a glimpse of a wallet on a table] Wait! There's his wallet! [runs up to it with Kenny]
166,8,3,Mel Gibson,Freedom! [Stan grabs the wallet and rifles through it]
167,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? [Kenny hands Stan $2]"
168,8,3,Mel Gibson,Jesus is Lord! [Stan puts the $2 in and takes out $20]
169,8,3,Stan Marsh,"All right, let's get the hell out of here! [heads for the doors and opens one. Mel dances in wearing a Carmen Miranda outfit. Stan and Kenny head for another pair of doors. Stan opens it and Mel enters dressed as a clown]"
170,8,3,Mel Gibson,"When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!"
171,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Aah! Run, dude, run!"
172,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[hopping out behind them, in Braveheart face paint and wielding a sword] K'plagh! K'plagh! And good evening, frieeeeeeends!"
173,8,3,Eric Cartman,"One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message! [some applause] Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world! [the crowd applauds] Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!"
174,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Woah! Great idea!
175,8,3,Man 3,It'll be like a parade!
176,8,3,Man 4,Good idea!
177,8,3,Eric Cartman,"And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."""
178,8,3,Elise Garrett,"Well, what does that mean, dear?"
179,8,3,Jack Garrett,"Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie."
180,8,3,Ticket Salesman,"Ooo, Aramaic. Cool."
181,8,3,Various Townsfolk,Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!
182,8,3,Jack Garrett,What was our Aramaic line again?
183,8,3,Eric Cartman,[pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets messed up from the impacts]
184,8,3,Various Townsfolk,"[repeats, gaining confidence with each syllable] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."
185,8,3,Eric Cartman,Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
186,8,3,Various Townsfolk,Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
187,8,3,Elise Garrett,"Oh, this is fun! [smiles]"
188,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[picks a mark in front of the crowd] All right, everyone! Forward, march! [they all move forward] Es ist Zeit für Rache!"
189,8,3,Various Townsfolk,Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
190,8,3,Eric Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache!
191,8,3,Various Townsfolk,Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
192,8,3,Eric Cartman,Nice.
193,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,"Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congregation. [Kyle approaches the lectern]"
194,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Thank you, rabbi. [Sheila smiles and gets Gerald's attention. Kyle clears his throat.] In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus."
195,8,3,Man 4,What? [others murmur their shock]
196,8,3,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat?!
197,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it."
198,8,3,Man 5,Oh my God! [the other congregants groan]
199,8,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!"
200,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,I saw The Passion!
201,8,3,Man 6,Oh no! The Passion?! [others murmur]
202,8,3,Man 7,This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
203,8,3,Man 8,"Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes."
204,8,3,Man 9,Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
205,8,3,Woman 4,Something must be done to stop that movie!
206,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,"Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm."
207,8,3,Mob,[from outside] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
208,8,3,Eric Cartman,"[from outside] Es ist Zeit für Rache! [congregants rise and face the doors in the back, others look out the windows. They see Cartman leading a march past the synagogue]"
209,8,3,Mob,Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
210,8,3,Eric Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache!
211,8,3,Mob,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten! [the rabbi and his congregants look on, confused]"
212,8,3,Eric Cartman,Es ist Zeit für Rache!
213,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson. [net loss, sixty-nine dollars] But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters."
214,8,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. I agree.) [a truck horn blows and Stan stands to see who it is. Kenny joins him]
215,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. [Mel Gibson closes in fast in his Mad Max gas truck and wearing Braveheart face paint]"
216,8,3,Mel Gibson,Give me back my money! [blows his horn again]
217,8,3,Stan Marsh,"Goddamn, that guy's crazy. [hops off his seat and runs up to the driver] Hey dude, you've gotta speed up."
218,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,Huh?
219,8,3,Stan Marsh,Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
220,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,"Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games."
221,8,3,Stan Marsh,"I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- [Mel plows into the bus, making both vehicles screech. The riders sway in their seats]"
222,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,What the hell?
223,8,3,Mel Gibson,[shaking his fist in the air] Haaaa! K'Plaaaa!
224,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,Hey! That's Mel Gibson!
225,8,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I told you that!
226,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,"Well, what the hell does he want?!"
227,8,3,Stan Marsh,"He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it."
228,8,3,Tour Bus Driver,You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. [Mel rams into them again]
229,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[to his parents] Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!"
230,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Can I help you?
231,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater!
232,8,3,Various Jewish Congregants,That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!
233,8,3,Shlomo,Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!
234,8,3,Man 1,We demand you stop showing it!
235,8,3,Various Jewish Congregants,Yeah! Yeah!
236,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[facing the congregants] No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob! [behind him Cartman is seen leading his mob to the theater] The last time we did that we killed Jesus!"
237,8,3,Eric Cartman,[points] Juden!
238,8,3,Jack Garrett,What's going on here?
239,8,3,Ticket Salesman,They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
240,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
241,8,3,Man 11,Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
242,8,3,Elise Garrett,It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
243,8,3,Jewish Rabbi,It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
244,8,3,Jack Garrett,"Well, maybe you should apologize."
245,8,3,Mob,That's right! What he said.
246,8,3,Woman 5,"How dare you?! [the sound of a truck is faintly heard, but gets stronger.]"
247,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[noticing] Look out!! [The crowds move to the other side of the street as the tour bus skids to a stop just past the theater. Mel Gibson roars into town and crashes into the ticket booth, and his gas truck blows up. The crowds crawl out of their safety places and merge]"
248,8,3,Mel Gibson,Give me my eighteen dollars!
249,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Mel! Gibson! [brightens and approaches him, then grovels at his feet] Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding! [grovels some more] Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!"
250,8,3,Mel Gibson,"Ha! [ignores Cartman and walks up to Stan and Kenny] So! You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh? I guess now you're gonna start torturing me! Well! [grabs his nipples and falls on his knees. The crowd steps back as he twists his nipples] Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!"
251,8,3,Ticket Salesman,That's... Mel Gibson?
252,8,3,Jack Garrett,H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
253,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[backs up towards a building] Yeah... [grabs a piece of crap from his ass and removes it from his briefs, turns around, and defaces the building] I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?!"
254,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[joins Stan and Kenny] Dude, what's wrong with him?"
255,8,3,Stan Marsh,"He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind."
256,8,3,Mel Gibson,"You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you? [gets down on all fours and hoists his ass up] Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!"
257,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
258,8,3,Mel Gibson,"[rises and walks up to the boys] Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!"
259,8,3,Stan Marsh,It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
260,8,3,Mel Gibson,"You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!"
261,8,3,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results."
262,8,3,Jack Garrett,"You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ."
263,8,3,Ticket Salesman,Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
264,8,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!"
265,8,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. [a grinning Mel squats and farts on Cartman, defecating on Cartman]"
266,8,3,Mel Gibson,Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo! [hops towards the camera.]
