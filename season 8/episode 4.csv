0,8,4,Eric Cartman,"Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. [a car goes up a ramp and jumps off]"
1,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. [Stan's car is uncooperative]
2,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. [some kids come up behind Stan]"
3,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, who are those kids?"
4,8,4,Boombox,"Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!
[brief instrumental]
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance-"
5,8,4,OC Leader,"Yeah, how you like that y'all! [Stan and his friends merely look on]"
6,8,4,OC Member 1,[dressed in red] Let's bring it to these losers.
7,8,4,OC Girl,Aww yeah!
8,8,4,OC Leader,"Whatchoo got, huh?! You got nothin'!"
9,8,4,OC Leader,Damn! You just got served!
10,8,4,OC Leader,Aww man!
11,8,4,OC Girl,"He got you, dude."
12,8,4,OC Leader,Now that kid is gettin' served!
13,8,4,OC Girl,Uh huh.
14,8,4,OC,Whoa!
15,8,4,OC Leader,"Aww man, look at them! They know they can't trip to that! [the girl turns the radio off and the dancers turn and walk away.] Yeah! We're outta here!"
16,8,4,OC Member 2,"[in gray-green, looks left] That was smokin'!"
17,8,4,OC Member 1,[looks right] They didn't do nothin'!
18,8,4,OC Member 3,"[Asian, turns around] Sorry y'all, but try not to let it sting too bad! [laughs and turns around]"
19,8,4,OC Leader,[turns around] You got served! [the others laugh and he turns around] Come on! They had nothin'! Let's go y'all!
20,8,4,OC Member,Come on y'all! [...and they're gone]
21,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,...What the hell just happened?
22,8,4,Chef,"[opens up] Oh. Hello there, children!"
23,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we just got served."
24,8,4,Chef,"Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa."
25,8,4,Chef,"Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe. [the boys sit down] Are you all okay?"
26,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
27,8,4,Chef,"All right. Now, where did you get served?"
28,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-"
29,8,4,Chef,"Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight. [turns around and picks up the phone] I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay. [taps out a number and the phone rings] Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it."
30,8,4,Sharon Marsh,"Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay."
31,8,4,Randy Marsh,What's the matter with him?
32,8,4,Sharon Marsh,Oh. Stan got served at school today.
33,8,4,Randy Marsh,You got served? By who?
34,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Some, kids from Orange County."
35,8,4,Sharon Marsh,Let's not make a big deal out of it.
36,8,4,Randy Marsh,So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
37,8,4,Stan Marsh,No.
38,8,4,Randy Marsh,What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
39,8,4,Sharon Marsh,That was the right thing to do.
40,8,4,Randy Marsh,"No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak."
41,8,4,Stan Marsh,"But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'."
42,8,4,Randy Marsh,"[in low tones] Well then, it's about time you learned! [rises from the table] Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!"
43,8,4,Stan Marsh,But Dad-
44,8,4,Randy Marsh,Now! [walks off]
45,8,4,Randy Marsh,"All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this."
46,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stan."
47,8,4,Randy Marsh,"...six, seven, eight."
48,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that is a sweet RC car!"
49,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[carrying the car] Yeah, let's go race it right now![they run into the OC kids]"
50,8,4,OC Member 2,"Well, what we got here?"
51,8,4,OC Member 1,It's the white boys that were served yesterday. [they laugh]
52,8,4,OC Leader,"You want a little more, homeboys?"
53,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We're not interested, thanks."
54,8,4,OC Member 1,[steps forth] You're not interested? Not interested in this?
55,8,4,Boombox,"You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.
You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the OC crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare."
56,8,4,Black Man,"Oh Lord, look at those moves."
57,8,4,Black Woman,"Oooo, they are takin' it out!"
58,8,4,Black Man 2,"Oh man, they are getting served!"
59,8,4,Black Woman 2,"Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!"
60,8,4,Black Man 3,Have mercy!
61,8,4,Others,"Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin' served!"
62,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! Go Stan!
63,8,4,Chef,"Oh no! [begins to cross the street] No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'!"
64,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,All right Stan!
65,8,4,Eric Cartman,Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
66,8,4,OC Leader,Wha?
67,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! You got served!
68,8,4,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
69,8,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
70,8,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's right!
71,8,4,Eric Cartman,All right!
72,8,4,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
73,8,4,Chef,[arrives] No no no!
74,8,4,OC Leader,"Okay. All right. We got served. So now, I guess... It's on."
75,8,4,Stan Marsh,What?
76,8,4,OC Member 1,This Saturday! Our top five dancers against your top five dancers! OC Convention Center. It's on!
77,8,4,OC Members,It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
78,8,4,Townsman,[closes his eyes and laments] Oh Lord it's on!
79,8,4,Chef,Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
80,8,4,OC Member 3,"We'll see you Saturday, fools! [the crowd behind the OC crew parts and they leave]"
81,8,4,OC Members,"Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better dancers with you than those loozas! 'Cause it's on!"
82,8,4,OC Members,It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
83,8,4,Chef,"Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?"
84,8,4,Stan Marsh,I thought I was supposed to!
85,8,4,Chef,Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
86,8,4,Stan Marsh,But why?
87,8,4,Chef,"Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??"
88,8,4,Sharon Marsh,"[enters the kitchen with Stan] Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!"
89,8,4,Randy Marsh,[turns around] What?
90,8,4,Sharon Marsh,Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
91,8,4,Randy Marsh,So what happened?
92,8,4,Sharon Marsh,It's on!
93,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Come on now, keep it tight!"
94,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Good. Now watch that timing, drill team!"
95,8,4,OC Member 1,All right!
96,8,4,OC Girl,[stands] All right!
97,8,4,OC Leader,"Yeah, bad ass!"
98,8,4,OC Member 2,"Yeah, that was tight!"
99,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Not bad, kids. Not bad. [Randy approaches]"
100,8,4,OC Member 1,Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a chance!
101,8,4,OC Girl,I heard that!
102,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"All right, it was good. But we don't want ""good,"" we want pain!"
103,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Uh, hey, ex- excuse me."
104,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,[turns around] Yeah?
105,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm Stan Marsh's father."
106,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday?"
107,8,4,OC Member 3,Dang!
108,8,4,OC Leader,Oooooo!
109,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on."
110,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Oh, it's on!"
111,8,4,Randy Marsh,"No, no, no, it's not on."
112,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Whoo, it's on all right!"
113,8,4,Randy Marsh,It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
114,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,[insistent] It's on!
115,8,4,Randy Marsh,I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. [turns around and walks away]
116,8,4,The Orange County Crew Coach,"Hold on a second, clam-head! [catches him and blocks his way] You think you can just roll in here and tell us it's not on when it very clearly is on?! You're just trying to make us not practice, aren't you?! Because you know that your kids are goin' down when my kids give them this! Give me some moves out, Girl T! [the girl turns on the boombox] Check this out! [balances on his left hand and bounces around, then stands up] Yeah! You like that?!"
117,8,4,OC Leader,Oooo man! [shakes his head]
118,8,4,OC Member 1,Ohhh Lord!
119,8,4,OC Leader,"Oooo, he is gettin' served! [the girl shakes her head]"
120,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah."
121,8,4,Sharon Marsh,"[enters with Stan] Randy? [rushes to his bedside] Randy, oh my God!"
122,8,4,Skeeter,"What happened to him, Doctor?"
123,8,4,Dr Doctor,He got served. Worst I've ever seen.
124,8,4,Jimbo Kern,"Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce."
125,8,4,Chef,Oh Lord...
126,8,4,Randy Marsh,"[his voice raspy] His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive. [winces] Ungh! Grrgh."
127,8,4,Unnamed Nurse,"[soothing him] Shh. Relax, Mr. Marsh. [Dr. Doctor walks off]"
128,8,4,Dr Doctor,We just got the X-rays back. [walks to a backlit board and points out the injuries] He mostly got served here [a rib] and here [forearm]. But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one.
129,8,4,Jimbo Kern,"Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?"
130,8,4,Skeeter,"Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father! [looks over at his dad, then at the other men]"
131,8,4,Stan Marsh,"I, I don't know. He seems all right."
132,8,4,Mr Garrison,"I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!"
133,8,4,Randy Marsh,Stan? Stan?
134,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[walks to Randy's bedside] Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad."
135,8,4,Randy Marsh,"Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me."
136,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, good."
137,8,4,Randy Marsh,"[emphatic] But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. [passes out. The ""8 Mile"" theme begins to play and the camera closes in on Stan]"
138,8,4,Stan Marsh,[thinks and then walks off miffed] God dammit!
139,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?"
140,8,4,Michael,[with cigarette] Of course we know how to dance.
141,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?"
142,8,4,Pete,Dance troupe? Please. [leans to one side and whips his hair back into place] We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school. [whips his hair back into place] Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
143,8,4,Michael,Yeah. [stands up] The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette.
144,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served."
145,8,4,Pete,[flips his hair back] No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
146,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to the red Goth] Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?"
147,8,4,Pete,I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
148,8,4,Henrietta,Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
149,8,4,Firkle,I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.
150,8,4,Michael,"I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it. [rises and walks over to Stan]"
151,8,4,Stan Marsh,Great! [they leave together]
152,8,4,Henrietta,Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
153,8,4,Pete,Yeah. We just got Goth-served.
154,8,4,Stan Marsh,"All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance."
155,8,4,Michael,We should go to the arcade. [takes a drag from his cigarette]
156,8,4,Stan Marsh,The arcade?
157,8,4,Michael,Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. [takes a drag from his cigarette]
158,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's incredible."
159,8,4,Michael,"He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. [the game gets faster and faster and the kid keeps up. Eventually the game ends, the boy picks up his soda cup and walks away.]"
160,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[catches up to Yao at the change machine] Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?"
161,8,4,Yao,"You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?"
162,8,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
163,8,4,Yao,That's stupid. [waves him off and walks away]
164,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[catches up] Dude, we need you."
165,8,4,Yao,I can't dance without the machine.
166,8,4,Stan Marsh,It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
167,8,4,Yao,Okay. I'll give it a shot.
168,8,4,Stan Marsh,"All right, that's three!"
169,8,4,Michael,"Dude, we need a girl."
170,8,4,Stan Marsh,Huh?
171,8,4,Michael,We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.
172,8,4,Stan Marsh,Oh yeah. [thinks a bit with finger to chin] Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
173,8,4,Porsche,"Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?"
174,8,4,Stan Marsh,Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
175,8,4,Maury,"You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls. [Stan look at his crew. Moments later they are seated at the bar, with Mercedes]"
176,8,4,Stan Marsh,And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
177,8,4,Mercedes,"[twirling her hair] Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else."
178,8,4,Stan Marsh,So you'll do it?
179,8,4,Mercedes,Why not?
180,8,4,Stan Marsh,"All right, we just need one more person!"
181,8,4,Mercedes,"Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing."
182,8,4,Stan Marsh,What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
183,8,4,Mercedes,I think his name was... [closes her eyes] Leopold... Stotch or something?
184,8,4,Stan Marsh,Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
185,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-"
186,8,4,Linda Stotch,"[enters] Butters, you have some visitors. [Stan, Michael, Mercedes, and Yao appear]"
187,8,4,Butters Stotch,"[turns around] Oh well, hi there everybody. [his mom leaves]"
188,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe."
189,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?"
190,8,4,Stan Marsh,"It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. [his smile vanishes as he begins to think back, then a small grimace appears.]"
191,8,4,Butters Stotch,...No.
192,8,4,Stan Marsh,"But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska."
193,8,4,Butters Stotch,"No. [hops off the chair and runs away] No no no no no no, no! [runs into the living room and up the stairs] No! No no no no!"
194,8,4,Linda Stotch,Butters? [rises and looks up the stairs] Butters?! [Stan and the other kids enter]
195,8,4,Stan Marsh,We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
196,8,4,Linda Stotch,"Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy."
197,8,4,Mercedes,A tragedy?
198,8,4,Butters Stotch,[from his room] Waaaaah!
199,8,4,Linda Stotch,"I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go."
200,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?"
201,8,4,Yao,Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance.
202,8,4,Stan Marsh,"A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park."
203,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Aaaaah! [quickly throws the shoes and clippings away, then goes to cry into his pillow] Aaaaah!"
204,8,4,Stan Marsh,"All right, so you're sure he can dance?"
205,8,4,A Rancher,Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.
206,8,4,Yao,That don't look like a dancing duck to me.
207,8,4,A Rancher,"Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy."
208,8,4,A Rancher,"You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honeeey.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, babe."
209,8,4,A Rancher,"You'll do a line and I'll do a line, we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time.
Honey, babe, be mine.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey-"
210,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?"
211,8,4,A Rancher,"No no, he'll dance to anything. See?
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night and day.
Honey, babe, be mine."
212,8,4,Stan Marsh,"My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe."
213,8,4,Linda Stotch,"Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay. [a shot of Butters under the covers, with bug eyes] Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie."
214,8,4,Butters Stotch,Two years ago. Two years ago!
215,8,4,Announcer,"That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis, folks. Let her hear it! [she waves to the audience and walks off] All right, and now, dancing to the song ""I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You,"" here is Colorado state champion, Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch! [the audience applauds. The Stotches are present and clapping with the audience. The song begins to play, Butters begins to dance]"
216,8,4,Singer,"I've got something in my front pocket for you
Why don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it is
Then grab onto it, it's just for you
Give a little squeeze and say, ""How do you do?""
There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my front pocket,
There's something in my front pocket-"
217,8,4,Butters Stotch,Whoops.
218,8,4,Woman,Paul. Paul!
219,8,4,Butters Stotch,Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [a man is trampled to death underfoot. Butters watches the auditorium empty out] No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!
220,8,4,Chef,"All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'! [sets his stuff onto a table next to the door] We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be. [moves further into the studio] I think we should- [stops] Whoa. [a shot of the five dancers, including Jeffy, who quacks] This... is the dance troupe?"
221,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer."
222,8,4,Chef,"Oh boy. [returns to his boombox] All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do!"
223,8,4,Boombox,"You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.
You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the East-side crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare."
224,8,4,Chef,"Oh Lord have mercy. [turns off the boombox] Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart. [scratches his head] No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent."
225,8,4,Stan Marsh,"We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?"
226,8,4,Yao,What? I don't wanna get served.
227,8,4,Mercedes,"Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served."
228,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- [the others also speak, the others continue to argue, talking over one another.]"
229,8,4,Chef,"All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. [Stan droops his head.]"
230,8,4,Butters Stotch,What do you want?
231,8,4,Stan Marsh,"I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you."
232,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore. [leaves his chair and walks up to his Lego box] I gave that up."
233,8,4,Stan Marsh,Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
234,8,4,Butters Stotch,[rummaging for Lego blocks to take back to his desk] Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
235,8,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault.
236,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Yeah well, you tell that to their families. [returns to his desk with a new batch of blocks]"
237,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that."
238,8,4,Butters Stotch,"[whirls around] I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!"
239,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant."
240,8,4,Butters Stotch,What?
241,8,4,Stan Marsh,And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
242,8,4,Butters Stotch,[cups his hear so he hears no more] Aaaah!
243,8,4,Stan Marsh,"But that isn't the point, Butters! [Butters resumes building his tiny town] The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man."
244,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Get out of my room, Stan."
245,8,4,Stan Marsh,"[Firmly] Fine. [walks to the door and opens it] But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. [leaves and closes the door. Butters, angered, tosses some blocks into his town, then wipes the town off the desk.]"
246,8,4,Unnamed MC,"Yeah, make some noise!"
247,8,4,Unnamed MC,"Ladies and Gentlemen,"
248,8,4,Unnamed MC,"man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim!"
249,8,4,Lil Kim,"[high squeaky voice] What's up, niggaz?! [waves to the audience]"
250,8,4,Unnamed MC,"This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all. So let's give it up for the OC Crew! [the crew is shown, then their parents in the audience are shown] And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!"
251,8,4,Jimbo Kern,"Man, it is about to get crazy up in here."
252,8,4,Mr Garrison,"Aww, yeah."
253,8,4,Unnamed MC,A'ight y'all. It's showtime!
254,8,4,Announcer,Dancers to the floor! [the OC Crew steps forth]
255,8,4,Mercedes,"[runs up to Stan] Stan. Stan, we have a big problem!"
256,8,4,Stan Marsh,What?
257,8,4,Mercedes,It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.
258,8,4,Stan Marsh,What happened??
259,8,4,Mercedes,He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor.
260,8,4,OC Member 3,"Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!"
261,8,4,Yao,Can he move it?
262,8,4,Stan Marsh,"Aw, what do we do, Chef?!"
263,8,4,Chef,"Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit."
264,8,4,OC Member 1,Looks like they ain't even gonna dance.
265,8,4,OC Leader,They're too scared! Looks like they already got served!
266,8,4,Butters Stotch,Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
267,8,4,Stan Marsh,Butters! [the SP crew moves towards him]
268,8,4,Chef,All right!
269,8,4,Unnamed MC,"All right come on, let's do this! DJ! Give us a hot track!"
270,8,4,CD,"Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!"
271,8,4,CD,"Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!"
272,8,4,CD,"Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you dance sucka!"
273,8,4,Butters Stotch,"Waaah! [the spectators follow the shoe's arc. The shoe hits a stage light, which comes down and kills the OC leader. The OC coach comes forward] No! Jesus, not again!"
274,8,4,OC Member 1,Aaaah!
275,8,4,OC Member 3,Get out of here!
276,8,4,Unnamed MC,"[walks up, sadly] Folks, it looks like the OC crew is dead. [excitedly] That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!"
277,8,4,Skeeter,Woo!
278,8,4,Mr Garrison,Yeah!
279,8,4,Jimbo Kern,All right!
280,8,4,Chef,All right! We did it! [he and the Diggitys approach Butters]
281,8,4,Stan Marsh,All right Butters!
282,8,4,Yao,You did it!
283,8,4,Randy Marsh,"You did it, son! You did it!"
284,8,4,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters!"
285,8,4,Butters Stotch,No! No! Noooooo!
