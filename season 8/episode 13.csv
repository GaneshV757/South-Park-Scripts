0,8,13,Clyde Donovan,"I don't know, that looks pretty high up."
1,8,13,Butters Stotch,Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
2,8,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. [Cartman is shown at the edge of the roof wearing wings made from cardboard]"
3,8,13,Eric Cartman,"This is gonna be totally cool, you guys."
4,8,13,Stan Marsh,It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
5,8,13,Eric Cartman,"[assessing the situation] ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here."
6,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,[arrives in time to see Cartman's attempt] What's going on?
7,8,13,Stan Marsh,Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. [Kyle looks up to see what the others see. Cartman looks down]
8,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Do it! Do it!
9,8,13,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna!
10,8,13,Craig,I wouldn't if I were you.
11,8,13,Token Black,Those wings don't look very strong.
12,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!"
13,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, here we go. [steps forward and gets ready to launch himself] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-"
14,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Awww, go on and do it already!"
15,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations."
16,8,13,Stan Marsh,[to Kenny] He's not gonna do it.
17,8,13,Eric Cartman,"And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! [he flaps his cardboard wings a few times to get some lift, then jumps off the roof. He heads straight for the ground and lands on his face with a grunt. All the boys are shocked and stand there frozen for several seconds. Stan is the first to leave, then Kyle, then the rest of them. Only Butters remains, and he turns to watch the others leave. After a few seconds of uncertainty, he leaves too.]"
18,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh my God! Eric! Eric, [caresses him] Mommy's here. Sweetie? [notices Dr. Doctor] Oh, what's wrong with him?"
19,8,13,Dr Doctor,"I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma."
20,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Coma... My God, fo- for how long?"
21,8,13,Dr Doctor,"There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see. [the camera looks at Cartman, then pans up and fades out]"
22,8,13,Singers,"Seasons change, time passes by.
As the weeks become the months become the years."
23,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Eugh... [sits up, his eyes still closed.]"
24,8,13,Liane Cartman,[stands up and drops her book] Oh my- Doctor! [Cartman blinks] He's awake! [the doctor and nurse return]
25,8,13,Eric Cartman,Wheh? Where am I?
26,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!"
27,8,13,Dr Doctor,"You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time."
28,8,13,Eric Cartman,Coma... How long?
29,8,13,Dr Doctor,"It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now."
30,8,13,Nurse,"Yes, Doctor. [tugs at the facial hair and it comes off.]"
31,8,13,Dr Doctor,"Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days. [a shot of the hospital's exterior, then back to the recovery room, where Liane is giving Cartman a glass of chocolate milk]"
32,8,13,Singers,"Seasons change, time passes by. 
As the weeks become the months become the years."
33,8,13,Liane Cartman,"You're doing so much better, muffin."
34,8,13,Eric Cartman,Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
35,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again."
36,8,13,Dr Doctor,"[at another patient's bed] I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do."
37,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.
38,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"We'd better get back to the station, sir."
39,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!"
40,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?"
41,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!"
42,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"[fishes around in the front shirt pocket and is surprised to find them there, then turns to the doctor] Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?"
43,8,13,Dr Doctor,"Yes, it was pretty severe."
44,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"What is it, Lou?"
45,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
46,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Aw, come on, sir."
47,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"I know it's ridiculous, [turns right and walks off] but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can! [Murphy follows. They arrive at Cartman's bed] Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?"
48,8,13,Eric Cartman,Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
49,8,13,Nurse 2,"Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time. [the officers are amazed at how timely the nurse came with the lunch]"
50,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?"
51,8,13,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, I just knew it. [receives the tray from the nurse and sniffs] Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!"
52,8,13,Nurse 2,"Yep, meatloaf again. [the officers get a little frightened]"
53,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Jesus, how did he...?"
54,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Little boy... [whispers to himself] Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but... [back to Cartman] we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.
55,8,13,Liane Cartman,His new... powers?
56,8,13,Female Detective,"All right, make sure you get pictures of everything in this crime scene. [one officer takes pictures, another handles evidence gingerly. Nearby, a police tape is lifted so Cartman could check out the scene]"
57,8,13,Officer 1,Who's the kid?
58,8,13,Officer 2,He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.
59,8,13,Officer 1,"Aw, Christ!"
60,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"[with Murphy, Liane, and Cartman] This is... where the body was found. [overhead shot] Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others."
61,8,13,Eric Cartman,How come the outline is missing its hand?
62,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy. [Cartman walks around the outline, inspecting it.]"
63,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Stand back, give him room! [moves to hold the crowd back] Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?"
64,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles... [he sees a hand holding Double-Stuff Oreo] Double-Stuff Oreos... [a second hand comes up and twists off the lower cookie] He ... He's taking the top of one and... [squeezes his eyes closed and sees another Oreo attached to the first one so there are two fillings between the cookies] ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs! [the detective writes down what Cartman is seeing] I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!"
65,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Jesus Christ!
66,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Sir?
67,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!"
68,8,13,Tom Johansen,"Yes? Oh, hello, detectives."
69,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?"
70,8,13,Tom Johansen,"Sure, come on in! [he backs up and leads them in. The lead detectives calls in some officers hidden nearby, and they come in] I'm afraid the house is a little bit of a disaster area since I have-"
71,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Get him! [the officers tackle Tom Johansen and beat him harshly with their batons] Code 6! Code 6!
72,8,13,Officer 3,"Use the taser! Use the taser! [another officer fires a taser into Tom Johansen, who then convulses and falls to the floor]"
73,8,13,Officer 4,"Do it again! [the officer shocks Tom Johansen again, causing more convulsions]"
74,8,13,Officer 3,"He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him!"
75,8,13,Tom Johansen,Why?! Why?! [the officers haul him away]
76,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history."
77,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough."
78,8,13,Eric Cartman,Guess again.
79,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"[walks over and hands him some money] All right, here's a hundred dollars."
80,8,13,Eric Cartman,Wow!
81,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"[to Liane] His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good."
82,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy."
83,8,13,Eric Cartman,I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
84,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up. Other kids gather behind him] Cartman, what did you do?!"
85,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! [shows off the money]"
86,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
87,8,13,Eric Cartman,Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
88,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!"
89,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!"
90,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,You don't have any powers!
91,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!"
92,8,13,Butters Stotch,"Wuh be careful, Kyle."
93,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,He can't do crap!
94,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! [closes his eyes and starts making sound effects and hand motions. The boys behind Kyle except Stan and Kenny scatter, and the detectives spot him as they enter the school.]"
95,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric! [they approach him, he turns around] We've got a little problem."
96,8,13,Eric Cartman,What?
97,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed."
98,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,This body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it!
99,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Which can only mean one thing!
100,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Ha! You see?!
101,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
102,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
103,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.
104,8,13,Eric Cartman,I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
105,8,13,Chris Swollenballs,"Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town, where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene. [Cartman approaches the body, which is covered with a red blanket]"
106,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,This is fuckin' ridiculous!
107,8,13,Lou,"Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything?"
108,8,13,Eric Cartman,No. Nothing.
109,8,13,Officer 5,Maybe his powers have left him.
110,8,13,Officer 6,Yeah.
111,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute. [his right arm twitches and he sees a bucket of chicken, then sees some chicken served next to the powdered doughnuts he saw earlier. His eyes are squeezed tight.] Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh! [sees some syrup poured onto the chicken] There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!"
112,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is wrong with these people?!
113,8,13,Michael Deets,"[in robe and cap] They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties? [whips open his robe to reveal himself dressed in a yellow bikini. The boys look on, a little afraid]"
114,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! What about this guy?!
115,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Quiet! He's havin' a vision!
116,8,13,Eric Cartman,"It is fried chicken! [first he sees a plate of fried chicken, then the maple syrup, then some whipped cream, then some chocolate syrup, then a cherry on top...] Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae."
117,8,13,Weird Man,"[brings out a mannequin torso and head and strikes up a conversation with it] ""Junior, what are you doing out?"" I'm sorry, Mother. ""You come home right now and have sex with me!"" No, Mommy! [goes away]"
118,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!"
119,8,13,Lou,"I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law!"
120,8,13,Announcer,"This is Park County News 4, with your host, Jim Brown-ish"
121,8,13,Jim Brown ish,"The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help."
122,8,13,Eric Cartman,"If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
[someone knocks on his door, then the door opens]"
123,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you."
124,8,13,Eric Cartman,"More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring."
125,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Ah, no, these people claim that they are the ""real"" psychic detectives. [Cartman stops counting money and freezes]"
126,8,13,Female Psychic,"So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?!"
127,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oooh, I'll go make some tea."
128,8,13,Male Psychic 1,"Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like we all did."
129,8,13,Other psychics,Yeah!
130,8,13,Eric Cartman,Proper channels?
131,8,13,Male Psychic 2,You were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the Psychic Detective School. [shows the ad in question. Looks nice]
132,8,13,Eric Cartman,I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
133,8,13,Male Psychic 1,"Well you just can't say you're a psychic detective, you have to use the ad in the comic book!"
134,8,13,Female Psychic,You must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings!
135,8,13,Eric Cartman,"[laughs at them] Ten percent, my balls, get lost!"
136,8,13,Female Psychic,"Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger?"
137,8,13,Female Psychic,"All right, everyone! [the rest of the psychics join in the battle against Cartman.  Liane returns with the tea.]"
138,8,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, goodness! What's going on?"
139,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!"
140,8,13,Liane Cartman,O-o-o-o-oh! [prostrates herself]
141,8,13,Female Psychic,Enough! [one male psychic is slow to respond] We are ...obviously quite evenly matched. I guess this will have to be settled in court.
142,8,13,Eric Cartman,In court?
143,8,13,Female Psychic,We brought a class-action lawsuit against you! We'll see you before the judge tomorrow! [the psychics turn and walk out]
144,8,13,Liane Cartman,Is it over? [the front door closes after the last psychic leaves]
145,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"[reading from a fact sheet] Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, bus driver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much."
146,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Jesus Christ! Cause of death?
147,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing."
148,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?! [goes to a nearby tree to think] Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!"
149,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[arriving with Stan and Kenny] Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis. [holds out his findings] I'm pretty sure he's your man."
150,8,13,Lou,[coolly] How do you know?! Are you psychic?!
151,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,No.
152,8,13,Lou,"Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but dammit she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again! [leaves with Murphy]"
153,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Why won't anybody listen to me?!
154,8,13,Kenny McCormick,"[pats Kyle on the shoulder] (Don't take it personally, Kyle.)"
155,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[shrugs Kenny off] I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman."
156,8,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!"
157,8,13,Token Black,There has to be another way!
158,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
159,8,13,Butters Stotch,"Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean."
160,8,13,Stan Marsh,"[under his breath] Butters, Goddammit."
161,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, here we go. [spreads his wings] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! [jumps off and lands on the ground below]"
162,8,13,Stan Marsh,"[a few moments later, sighs] Call an ambulance."
163,8,13,Jim Brown ish,"Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying. [footage of the arrests is shown. Two of them are beaten, a third is slammed against a squad car until the side of her head begins to bleed, and a fourth holds police at bay. He tries to fight them with his powers, but they simply open fire and kill him where he stands] The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman, [shown in dramatic pose with psychic waves emanating from his forehead] who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence."
164,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Cool. [the doorbell rings and Cartman concentrates] Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle! [the door opens and the weird man from the crime scenes enters and approaches Cartman] Who are you?"
165,8,13,Michael Deets,"You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness."
166,8,13,Eric Cartman,... 'Kay. Sweet.
167,8,13,Michael Deets,"Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds."
168,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second. [hops off the sofa, walks away a bit, and calls out] Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. [the weird man quickly advances and smothers Cartman's face with a cloth, making Cartman inhale chloroform. Cartman passes out.]"
169,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!"
170,8,13,Michael Deets,You are obviously a big fan of my work.
171,8,13,Eric Cartman,I don't even know you dude!
172,8,13,Michael Deets,But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
173,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus."
174,8,13,Michael Deets,"And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim."
175,8,13,Eric Cartman,"No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!"
176,8,13,Michael Deets,"Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation! [starts up a slideshow projector] This... is me at the grand canyon. [shows a shot of him there] Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore [the next picture is shown, with him looking lovingly at the faces there] Do you see?"
177,8,13,Eric Cartman,[nervously] Heheh.
178,8,13,Michael Deets,Do you see?!
179,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Yes yes, I see! [another Mount Rushmore picture is shown, with the man looking at the camera this time]"
180,8,13,Michael Deets,"Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio. [this time he looks psychotic, with his hands ready to grab something] This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?!"
181,8,13,Eric Cartman,AAAAAAAH!
182,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,[hangs up the phone] Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!
183,8,13,Female Detective,"Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours."
184,8,13,Officer 7,"Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He says another little boy just awoke from a coma, and is having psychic visions!"
185,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,[grabs his hat] Let's go! [other officers follow]
186,8,13,Dr Doctor,"This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours. [a shot of Kyle with a bandage around his head. He too has a face warmer on, but no black eye like Cartman had]"
187,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him."
188,8,13,Dr Doctor,Of course. Nurse? [a brunette approaches and removes the warmer. Sgt. Lou and Det. Murphy approach the bed]
189,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?"
190,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I see... a man... with a baseball cap. [Sgt. Lou snaps his fingers and Det. Murphy whips out a notepad and pen and starts taking notes. Kyle concentrates] He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m."
191,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"What do you think, Mitch?"
192,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman. [Kyle clenches his teeth in rage]"
193,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use."
194,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,...Sir?
195,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?"
196,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,...Restraint?
197,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint. [they leave]"
198,8,13,Michael Deets,Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park! [shows off the picture] Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?!
199,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! [the doorbell is heard. The two detectives are outside, Yates ringing the doorbell. Michael Deets opens the door]"
200,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr..."
201,8,13,Michael Deets,God.
202,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. [he shows them in. The house is dark, with stacks of paper everywhere. Pictures of his victims line the walls. Downstairs, Cartman tries to get attention.]"
203,8,13,Eric Cartman,(Hey! Come over here!)
204,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too."
205,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Sarge! In here! [Lou runs into the next room. They both face a wall of left hands nailed in place]
206,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy! [Murphy gets right on it. Yates thinks about the hands] Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong."
207,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Sir?
208,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.
209,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Right.
210,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Well those aren't left hands. [holds up his own left hand, palm in] See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands."
211,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Ohhh. [they return to the living room]
212,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Nope, this isn't our man. [they turn to leave the house and see Michael Deets in the shadows] We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. [they head out]"
213,8,13,Eric Cartman,"[in the basement] (Hey! Help!) [upstairs, Mr. Deets closes the front door]"
214,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer."
215,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,[stops and thinks] Yeah... Amazing coincidence...
216,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,[backs up] Heh- sir?
217,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right. [thinks for several seconds] Wait a minute."
218,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Sarge... [Lou slowly raises his hand palm in and analyzes it. Then he turns his hand over slowly until the palm is out and is jolted with recognition] What is it?
219,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. [runs off to do just that]
220,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"[back at the station, looks in on Murphy] Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?"
221,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,"Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer?"
222,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,[snaps his fingers] Oh right! The hands! Right! [the montage resumes]
223,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,Oh my God. Murphy! [Murphy appears quickly.] You're not gonna believe this.
224,8,13,Michael Deets,"That's it, no more pictures. [walks in front of Cartman and faces him, then pulls out a sharp knife] Time to die."
225,8,13,Eric Cartman,"No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested."
226,8,13,Michael Deets,Your hand will be one with the others.
227,8,13,Eric Cartman,"Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna- [spots the detectives descend the stairs and approach the room] I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! [begins to concentrate and make noises]"
228,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Hold it right there, killer! [Michael Deets turns and rushes at them with the knife. Yates fires three shots into him, killing him. The detectives advance, and Yates fires a forth shot into the body, looks around, and fires a fifth shot, getting blood splattered on himself]"
229,8,13,Eric Cartman,You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
230,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail."
231,8,13,Tom Johansen,"Yes, thank you very much, Kyle."
232,8,13,Female Psychic,"Yes, thanks."
233,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.
234,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard."
235,8,13,Detective Mitch Murphy,Do you think that's true?
236,8,13,Sergeant Harris Yates,"It must be true. The kid is psychic. [thinks a moment] But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. [they leave the room and then the hospital]"
237,8,13,Female Psychic,"[addressing Cartman] Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle."
238,8,13,Eric Cartman,You can't hurt me.
239,8,13,Male Psychic,"Then let this be our final battle! [the psychics face Cartman once again and battle him with their power. Nothing happens, but there's a lot of noise.]"
240,8,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[irritated] Just stop it! [at the top of his lungs] Stoop iiit!! [the lights go out as the bulbs shatter, then the shelf above his bed falls and everything on it hits the floor. The psychics and Cartman stop their battle and witness all this] There's a logical explanation for that."
