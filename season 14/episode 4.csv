0,14,4,Eric Cartman,I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
1,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,How the hell do you have more friends than me?
2,14,4,Eric Cartman,"'Cause people think I'm cool, dude."
3,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"How many friends do you have, Kenny?"
4,14,4,Kenny McCormick,(Sixty two)
5,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
6,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[walks in] Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?"
7,14,4,Eric Cartman,[retorts] Stupid Facebok stuff.
8,14,4,Stan Marsh,Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
9,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it."
10,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?"
11,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you."
12,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. [smiles]"
13,14,4,Eric Cartman,Surprise! [smiles]
14,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!"
15,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!"
16,14,4,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
17,14,4,Stan Marsh,I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
18,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy"
19,14,4,Stan Marsh,Who?
20,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends. [begins to gloat] And he's had a profile for more than six months."
21,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend."
22,14,4,Stan Marsh,You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox. [turns around and walks out.]
23,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
24,14,4,Kip and his parents,"[getting excited] Ahhhhh. [gets off his stool and runs around the room] Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa! Yeah! [opens the door, runs out of his room and down the stairs and into the kitchen]"
25,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!"
26,14,4,Kip s Mom,"Kip, really?"
27,14,4,Kip s Dad,You did?
28,14,4,Kip and his parents,Yeah!! [jumps for joy]
29,14,4,Kip s Dad,"Huh son, that's wonderful."
30,14,4,Kip s Mom,What's his name?
31,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading."
32,14,4,Kip s Mom,"Oh, is he a nice boy?"
33,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?! [runs back to his room]"
34,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?"
35,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to."
36,14,4,Randy Marsh,Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
37,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[looks over his shoulder] No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it."
38,14,4,Randy Marsh,"...Oh okay. [walks away, but returns a few seconds later] So I'm, m not your friend then?"
39,14,4,Stan Marsh,"...Dad, you are my friend."
40,14,4,Randy Marsh,"...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?"
41,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!"
42,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?"
43,14,4,Stan Marsh,I just wanna do my homework!
44,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Alright, fine. [walks away again. Stan puts his face in his left palm, then gets back to homework. Randy returns...] Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?"
45,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Alright, Dad, I'll add you!"
46,14,4,Randy Marsh,Oh cool! Okay. [walks away]
47,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!"
48,14,4,Kip s Mom,"That's great, Kip!"
49,14,4,Kip and his parents,Yeah! [runs off]
50,14,4,Kip s Dad,They sure are getting to know each other.
51,14,4,Kip s Mom,I'ts amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?
52,14,4,Kip s Dad,His friend lives on a farm?
53,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I think I'll add some more... pigs. [done] Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there. [moves his avatar to his corn fields and adds one] There we go. Nice. [a click and a small whoosh are heard, and Kyle looks at his screen. ""You have 29 friends""] Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends. [a click and a small whoosh are heard. ""You have 28 friends."" More of these sounds are heard as Kyle's friend count drops] Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! [Kyle does what he can, but keeps losing friends]"
54,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,Am I a joke to you?
55,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[stops moving, then turns around] What?"
56,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?"
57,14,4,Stan Marsh,"...Um, no?"
58,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!"
59,14,4,Stan Marsh,Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
60,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?"
61,14,4,Stan Marsh,Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
62,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page, [crosses her arms] we aren't friends!"
63,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry."
64,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to ""In a relationship""!"
65,14,4,Stan Marsh,How?
66,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"By editing your profile under ""basic information""!"
67,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, I'm sorry!"
68,14,4,Stan Marsh,"""Edit profile. Basic... settings"" Jesus Christ!"
69,14,4,Randy Marsh,Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
70,14,4,Stan Marsh,"...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!"
71,14,4,Randy Marsh,Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
72,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend."
73,14,4,Randy Marsh,"That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. [walks away]"
74,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously! [an update pops up] What the hell is this?! Podcast?"
75,14,4,Eric Cartman,"[in a video podcast]  Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast! [Mad Friends podcast. Cartman sits behind a Mad Friends desk. At the bottom of the screen are two tickers. The upper one shows changes in friend stocks, the lower one shows Facebook updates] Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends! [rings a bell and leaves his chair] Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon. [presses a big red button, which produces a shotgun blast] You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why? [shows a birthday cake] Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita. [presses a button that produces the sound of a whistle] If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street. [cranks up a player that repeats ""Word On The Street""] The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger [presses a robot that says ""MERGER""] So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle!"
76,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Can I come in?
77,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Sure dude. [Kyle enters, still sniffling] Dude, what's the matter?"
78,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,I... don't... have... any... friends...
79,14,4,Stan Marsh,What?
80,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now."
81,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you."
82,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?"
83,14,4,Stan Marsh,NO.
84,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
85,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!"
86,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[rushes up to Stan, falls on his knees, and grabs the lower part of his friend's jacket] YOU DON'T GET SUCKED INTO IT! YOU DON'T GET SUCKED IN AT ALL! PLEHEHEHEHEHEASE!"
87,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[frustrated] Ah, FUCK."
88,14,4,Stan Marsh,Okay it says I'm at your farm.
89,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button... [Stan does so] and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm... [Stan does so] Okay, now I can read the sign you put up..."
90,14,4,Stan Marsh,"'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends."
91,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!"
92,14,4,Kip s Dad,"So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?"
93,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year."
94,14,4,Kip s Mom,"[joins the boys at the table] Oh, what'd he say about those?"
95,14,4,Kip and his parents,He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!
96,14,4,Kip s Dad,Sounds like you boys had a ball!
97,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?"
98,14,4,Kip s Dad,"Well it's a little late, but it is Friday."
99,14,4,Kip s Mom,"I think the more time you spend with your little friend, the better."
100,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Wow, thanks! [runs out of the kitchen]"
101,14,4,Kip s Mom,"Have fun and be safe! [Kip runs through the living room and upstairs, then enters his own room]"
102,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too. [clicks on Share, and there's his status. He waits for a reply, from 7:20 to... 8:30. He gets a reply: Kyle likes the post] Hahaa haha! Yeah! [gets off his chair and dances around] Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
103,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."""
104,14,4,Stan Marsh,What?
105,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."" What is that supposed to mean?!"
106,14,4,Stan Marsh,...I have no idea.
107,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! [walks off in anger.]
108,14,4,Stan Marsh,[turns to see her walk off] Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! [turns around and continues on his way. He walks by an electronics store]
109,14,4,Man 1,"[standing in the doorway with a cigarette in his left hand] Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?"
110,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Fine! [continues walking, but a car pulls up next to him.]"
111,14,4,Man 2,"Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?"
112,14,4,Stan Marsh,[looks at him like he's crazy] I don't know you!
113,14,4,Man 2,"Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! [spits on Stan and drives off, Stan begins to shake in anger]"
114,14,4,Randy Marsh,Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
115,14,4,Stan Marsh,"...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-"
116,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Stan, poke your grandma!"
117,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[squeezes his eyes shut and stays still for a moment] No. NO! Screw this! You know what? ""Edit Profile > Update Profile."" There! ""Delete Profile""! [reads the popup] ""You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel"" Proceed! [presses ""Proceed,"" then reads the next popup.] ""Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No."" Yes! ""Are you totally sure?"" Yes! [clicks on it and his screen goes black. A blinking amber cursor appears]"
118,14,4,Computer Voice,"[the following words appear onscreen] I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Stan Marsh."
119,14,4,Stan Marsh,You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? [his monitor has a built-in Webcam]
120,14,4,Computer Voice,I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid.
121,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Delete Profile! ""Are you totally sure? Yes or-"" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete! [the webcam lights up and shoots a laser at Stan's forehead, knocking him back on his chair. It then sets up boxes of energy around his body] Hey Dad? [the camera begins scanning him in bit by bit, pixel by pixel] Dad? [He disappeared from his chair and he transported through the webcam. He soon appears on a virtual floor after traveling down some tunnels] Oh dude, what the fuck? [Neon lights appear all over]"
122,14,4,Guard 1,"Alright get moving, Profile."
123,14,4,Stan Marsh,Profile? I'm not a profile.
124,14,4,Guard 1,Ignore. [shocks him with an electric prod.]
125,14,4,Stan Marsh,AAH. [The guards escort Stan away]
126,14,4,Profile 1,Tom Davis says hello to Linda Green's profile.
127,14,4,Profile 2,Linda Davis likes how Tom Davis has changed his status.
128,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Excuse me, my name is-"
129,14,4,Profile 3,Ignore.
130,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Eh hey, could you tell me how I-"
131,14,4,Profile 4,Ignore.
132,14,4,Stan Marsh,[realizes where he is] Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
133,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
134,14,4,Eric Cartman,"You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him."
135,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad."
136,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip."
137,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
138,14,4,Eric Cartman,"It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?"
139,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,No. What's chatroulette?
140,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette."
141,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool."
142,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect."
143,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[a look of disgust comes over him] Aww, that's some dude jacking off! [turns away quickly]"
144,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?"
145,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's just a guy's penis too!
146,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay let's, let's try this one."
147,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away quickly] Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!"
148,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas. [goes onto the next person] Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?"
149,14,4,Dude,[waves] Hey.
150,14,4,Eric Cartman,This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
151,14,4,Dude,"Oh yeah? [leaves his chair and goes to the other end of his room, turns around, unzips his pants]"
152,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy..."
153,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!"
154,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!"
155,14,4,Stan Marsh,Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
156,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis","No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend?"
157,14,4,Stan Marsh,"No, I seriously don't want any more friends."
158,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis","Ignore. [turns to talk to another profile] So anyway, I really like taking long walks in the summer, you know, because there's like"
159,14,4,Stan Marsh,Okay I'll be your friend.
160,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis","[turns back to Stan] Confirm. [both of them feel a surge of energy in their game suits, shown by the suits lighting up, then it disappears] Oooo, Tom Davis is thrilled to have become powerful by adding a new friend. Here are some pictures of my dog. And here he is in some silly outfits. Can you comment on these?"
161,14,4,Stan Marsh,Awww!
162,14,4,Guard,"[comes up behind Stan] Move it, profile!"
163,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis",Oh oh.
164,14,4,Stan Marsh,Why oh oh?
165,14,4,Profile 5,They're taking him to the gaming arena.
166,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis","Looks like I'm gonna be down a friend. [the guards escort Stan to the arena, shocking him once in a while. Another profile appears next to him]"
167,14,4,Referee,"You are about to face each other in combat! You will play the game for the amusement of the users! [the arena is activated and Stan and the other profile are sent in] Let the game commence! [they face each other and virtual bikes pop up under them, lifting them off the floor. The bikes are replaced with a table and two stools and a guard brings a game of Yahtzee to the table.]"
168,14,4,Stan Marsh,Yahtzee?
169,14,4,Referee,"One round only! Begin! [the opposing profile rolls first, leaves a pair of 3s and scoops up three dice, rolls again]"
170,14,4,Profile 6,"Uhhh, I'm gonna count five in my five box."
171,14,4,Stan Marsh,Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
172,14,4,Guard,"[shocks him] Play, profile!"
173,14,4,Stan Marsh,[rolls and gets five 4s] Yahtzee. [the other profile gasps and vanishes in a fair bit of pain]
174,14,4,Eric Cartman,Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off... [coughs to clear his throat] That's a dude jacking off...
175,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"That's it Cartman, I'm outta here! [walks to the bedroom door] Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! [about to open the door]"
176,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle! [Kyle turns and goes back to Cartman's desk.] Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there."
177,14,4,Boy,Hello.
178,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too."
179,14,4,Boy,Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.
180,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?"

184,14,4,Kip s Mom,"No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now."
185,14,4,Referee,Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated!
186,14,4,Stan Marsh,I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
187,14,4,Referee,That's not what your profile said.
188,14,4,Stan Marsh,My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
189,14,4,Referee,Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now.
190,14,4,Stan Marsh,Oh yeah? I can try! [turns around and walks through a wall]
191,14,4,Referee,After him!
192,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome! [a new sound is heard] What the hell is that? Stan? [Stan appears on Kyle's farm and walks to the middle of the screen]"
193,14,4,Stan Marsh,"You're an asshole, Kyle!"
194,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,[perplexed] ...What?
195,14,4,Stan Marsh,What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
196,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks around making sure the coast is clear] Dude, w-what are you doing?"
197,14,4,Stan Marsh,What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
198,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Profile status?

218,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,What? Why?
219,14,4,Isiah,"User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock."
220,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him."
221,14,4,Isiah,Ignore.
222,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Unh, that does it!"
223,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up! [everyone shuts up and looks at him] Where is profile Stan Marsh! [the room begins to rumble]"
224,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,[rising from the ground] Right here.
225,14,4,Stan Marsh,Oh...
226,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. [moves the cursor to the Send button and clicks it. With the message sent, Kyle moves the cursor to the left side of the screen and selects ""Remove from Friends,"" and clicks that. A popup window shows up: ""Kip Drordy - Remove from Friends?"" He clicks on ""Remove from Friends"" and Facebook tells him his friend is removed.]"
227,14,4,Stan Marsh,"What do you want from me, dude?!"
228,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you."
229,14,4,Stan Marsh,Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
230,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world.
231,14,4,Stan Marsh,Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
232,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,Who is more powerful? The user or the profile? Let's end this once and for all. [the Yahtzee platform appears under them]
233,14,4,Referee,"Let the final battle begin! [the crowd drops down, or the platform rises. Hard to tell. The table and two stools appear and a guard brings the Yahtzee board game over]"
234,14,4,Stan Marsh,Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? [his giant profile takes a seat and rolls the dice]
235,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little-"
236,14,4,Stan Marsh,Yahtzee.
237,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,What?!
238,14,4,Stan Marsh,Yahtzee. Sixes.
239,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,No. Can't be.
240,14,4,Randy Marsh,Yahtzee!
241,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"No! Ahhhhh! [vanishes in a fair bit of pain. After some silence, Stan disappears from the arena and is reassembled back on his chair at home]"
242,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Awgh! [catches his breath. With his profile destroyed, Stan sees that he has 0 friends.] Oh thank God."
243,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?"
244,14,4,Stan Marsh,"My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else."
245,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?"
246,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Fuck off, Dad. [turns off the monitor and leaves his desk.]"
