1,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[after ""27""] Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache."
2,14,3,Coach,You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
3,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[faking] I know, it sucks. [the coach blows his whistle as the boys reach ""40""]"
4,14,3,Coach,"Alright kids, practice is over for today."
5,14,3,Eric Cartman,[grins and throws his sports bottle away] KFC!! [races for his ride]
6,14,3,Eric Cartman,Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
7,14,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!"
8,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you! [remembers where he is] Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!"
9,14,3,Stan Marsh,Hey it looks different.
10,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[to the customer] Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?"
11,14,3,Customer,"[stops] Oh, it's not a KFC anymore. It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary. [walks away]"
12,14,3,Stan Marsh,A what?
13,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!"
14,14,3,Kyle Broflovski,So where's the KFC now?
15,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. [leaves them and enters the store.]"
16,14,3,Clerk,Can I help you sir?
17,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?"
18,14,3,Clerk,"Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here."
19,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?"
20,14,3,Clerk,Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
21,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[thinks about what this means] Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion [goes to another counter] and give me some of that purplish stuff too!"
22,14,3,Clerk,Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
23,14,3,Randy Marsh,[his smile vanishes] My huh?
24,14,3,Clerk,"Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary."
25,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! [races out the door]"
26,14,3,Stan Marsh,What'd they say?
27,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[speaking quickly] KFC's gone, been replaced."
28,14,3,Eric Cartman,They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
29,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. [runs to the car, opens the driver-side door, and quickly gets in]"
30,14,3,Stan Marsh,"The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat."
31,14,3,Randy Marsh,"I gotta get to the doctor! [pulls out of his parking slot and drives away in a hurry, leaving the boys by themselves]"
32,14,3,Kyle Broflovski,...so no KFC?
33,14,3,Eric Cartman,This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
34,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal."
35,14,3,Randy Marsh,All right!
36,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Yep, you check out fine."
37,14,3,Randy Marsh,That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
38,14,3,Dr Doctor,For what?
39,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Medicinal marijuana. [the doctor frowns] There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed."
40,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana."
41,14,3,Randy Marsh,But you said I'm totally healthy!
42,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!"
43,14,3,Randy Marsh,"...Well that sucks! [gets off the bed and puts his clothes back on.] Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?"
44,14,3,Dr Doctor,Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
45,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but what's the quickest way?"
46,14,3,Dr Doctor,The what?
47,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?"
48,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Mom, drive faster!"
49,14,3,Liane Cartman,"The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient."
50,14,3,Eric Cartman,Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
51,14,3,Liane Cartman,"Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?"
52,14,3,Eric Cartman,WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
53,14,3,Liane Cartman,"Alright honey, let's take it easy."
54,14,3,Eric Cartman,Fuck you!
55,14,3,Eric Cartman,"No! No, what's going on?! [quickly gets out of the car and shoves a worker aside] Move aside! [stops at the front door and looks up again]"
56,14,3,Worker 1,"It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there."
57,14,3,Eric Cartman,"No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!"
58,14,3,Worker 1,"Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas."
59,14,3,Eric Cartman,You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
60,14,3,Worker 2,"No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal."
61,14,3,Eric Cartman,Nooooooooo-! [his head explodes]
62,14,3,Stan Marsh,"[opens the sliding door and looks out] Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer."
63,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. [Stan walks away and closes the sliding door]"
64,14,3,Clerk 2,Can I help you?
65,14,3,Eric Cartman,[looking fatigued and feeling quite itchy] I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. [sniffs heavily]
66,14,3,Clerk 2,"Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-"
67,14,3,Eric Cartman,[hops onto a little stool in front of the counter] Really?
68,14,3,Clerk 2,-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. [hands him an application]
69,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, what uh, are you serious? [fills out the application as she gets a treatment out of a cabinet. He turns around...] Oh my God, that's KFC gravy! [quite giddy] You have KFC! Yes! [she opens the gravy and pours some into a small cup, then slides the cup to him. He's disappointed] This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!"
70,14,3,Clerk 2,This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
71,14,3,Eric Cartman,Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
72,14,3,Clerk 2,"[takes the cup back] If you don't want it, that's fine-"
73,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[grabs it from her hand] NO! [swallows it as fast as he can] Oh God, oh God it's so good."
74,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[reading from the book ""Cancer Today""] ""Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers."" Alright. [takes the plate and puts the nuggets into the microwave oven, sets the time to four minutes, then starts the oven] ""Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."" [he loses hope] ""slow-growing and can take years to develop."" Dammit. [turns the page] ""Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive."" Oh this is good. ""There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation"" Hmmm. [closes the book and looks at the microwave and at his balls a few times. Some time later, Stan goes to the kitchen, opens the door, and grabs a sports energy drink, closes the door and walks away. He walks by Randy, who's got the microwave door open and his balls inside the oven.] Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer? [Stan just looks at him and continues on his way.] Stan?"
75,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!"
76,14,3,Sharon Marsh,Wha... WAAAAA! [she almost lost her mind there]
77,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer."
78,14,3,Randy Marsh,SCORE! [Sharon is not happy]
79,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-"
80,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!"
81,14,3,Dr Doctor,Your prescription for what?
82,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival..."
83,14,3,Randy Marsh,"One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!"
84,14,3,Randy Marsh,Uh that is nice! That is nice!
85,14,3,Jimbo Kern,"[walks by, sees him, and runs over] Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!"
86,14,3,Randy Marsh,"I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?"
87,14,3,Jimbo Kern,"No, I mean, your actual balls!"
88,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! [laughs]"
89,14,3,Tough Boy 1,"Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC."
90,14,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Who isn't?
91,14,3,Tough Boy 1,"Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house."
92,14,3,Eric Cartman,Billy Miller? Seriously??
93,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?"
94,14,3,Eric Cartman,Tommy said you have some KFC.
95,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Suuure. [snaps his fingers and waves someone forward] Jessie. [a girl brings a tray with food over to Cartman]
96,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce! [eats them as fast as he can] Oh God yes! [finishes it off] Where did you get that?!"
97,14,3,Billy and his Mom,I have my sources. That'll be $85.
98,14,3,Eric Cartman,85 bucks?? I don't have that! [three boys behind him get serious and approach him. One of them has a bat]
99,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"Hold on, hold on. [the boys stop] You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up."
100,14,3,Eric Cartman,How much KFC are we talking?
101,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
102,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Holy fuck, dude."
103,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?"
104,14,3,Eric Cartman,Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
105,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Excellent.
106,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[smokes, coughs a little] Alright, see you tomorrow! [turns left and has difficulty maneuvering his massive balls. He walks down the sidewalk happily and checks his watch] Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes! [starts moving faster, but the wheelbarrow soon falls apart and he's left sitting on his balls.] Huh-oh Jesus! [looks around, unsure of what to do] Ugh, ohh. [tries to get his feet on the ground, but can't] Uhh, hey, can somebody..? [puffs on the joint, then pulls at his scrotum] ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home. [gets off his balls and starts pulling them down the street. He sits on them again and bounces on them] Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. [bounces down the sidewalk]"
107,14,3,Eric Cartman,Are you Teabag?
108,14,3,Teabag,Maybe I am. Who's askin'?
109,14,3,Eric Cartman,Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
110,14,3,Teabag,"Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money? [Cartman hands him a wad of bills] Alright, we're in biz. [turns right and grabs a couple of bags of KFC food, then hands them to Cartman, who looks inside each bag] It's all there, man."
111,14,3,Eric Cartman,Extra crispy? [opens a small bowl of gravy and samples it carefully]
112,14,3,Teabag,"'Course, man, I ain't no fool."
113,14,3,Eric Cartman,You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
114,14,3,Teabag,"Awww, it's all the same shit, man."
115,14,3,Eric Cartman,IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! [reaches behind his back for a pistol and aims it at Teabag]
116,14,3,Teabag,"Okay okay I'm sorry, oh... [gets on his knees and shields his face]"
117,14,3,Eric Cartman,You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
118,14,3,Teabag,I'll take back the gravy.
119,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[lunges at him with the pistol, making him get on all fours] Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!"
120,14,3,Teabag,"AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too! [Barbrady walks by and stops to look]"
121,14,3,Officer Barbrady,What's going on back there?
122,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Nothin', it's cool."
123,14,3,Jimbo Kern,"Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned."
124,14,3,Randy Marsh,[puffs on a joint and coughs] Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
125,14,3,Nelson,"Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy."
126,14,3,Randy Marsh,"No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer."
127,14,3,Player 1,"Aw some on, just give us a little bit."
128,14,3,Player 2,Yeah.
129,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else. [a player listens a little more closely] Chicks... love 'em."
130,14,3,Nelson,Women love huge balls?
131,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going ""whaaa?"" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. [pats his balls]"
132,14,3,Woman 1,"Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa? [backs up at the sight of Randy's balls, then runs off]"
133,14,3,Randy Marsh,See?
134,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?"
135,14,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah I got the stuff. [the other boys carry the bags away] And I got the money. [tosses the wad of bills back at Billy]
136,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!
137,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. [burps]"
138,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little ""arrangement"" with the Colonel himself."
139,14,3,Eric Cartman,Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
140,14,3,Billy and his Mom,That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
141,14,3,Eric Cartman,Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
142,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Excellent.
143,14,3,Nurse,"Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. [hands the envelope to the doctor, who opens it and pulls the results out]"
144,14,3,Dr Doctor,What the hell is going on?
145,14,3,Nurse,Doctor?
146,14,3,Dr Doctor,This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.
147,14,3,Jimbo Kern,"Heh, I am stoned off my ass!"
148,14,3,Player 3,I'm stoned off my balls! [another man laughs]
149,14,3,Randy Marsh,Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
150,14,3,Woman 2,Wow. Those guys have nice balls.
151,14,3,Woman 3,Wish my man had balls like those.
152,14,3,Woman 2,Mmm.
153,14,3,The Colonel,"Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit."
154,14,3,"Billy's boys, including Tommy","We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?"
155,14,3,Eric Cartman,"I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want."
156,14,3,The Colonel,"I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend. Cartman: Who? You mean Tommy? [looks over at Tommy, then stops walking. The Colonel stops as well - Tommy is missing.] Wait, where's he go?"
157,14,3,The Colonel,"Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver. [hands him some binoculars and shows him where Tommy is. Through the binoculars, Cartman sees Tommy being roughed up by two men inside a helicopter. One of the men shows Tommy where Cartman is. There's a noose around Tommy's neck. The guy who shows him where Cartman is throws him out of the helicopter and hangs him. Cartman is stunned, but quickly gets over it and laughs]"
158,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked."
159,14,3,The Colonel,And how do I know you're not a liar too?
160,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!"
161,14,3,The Colonel,"I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time."
162,14,3,Eric Cartman,Good.
163,14,3,The Colonel,"Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me. [Cartman keeps his mouth shut]"
164,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"[walks up] Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger."
165,14,3,Randy Marsh,I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
166,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? [looks down at his balls]"
167,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?"
168,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-"
169,14,3,Randy Marsh,Hey. My eyes are up here.
170,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"I'm sorry, I just..."
171,14,3,Randy Marsh,"It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. [sends her an air kiss and hops out]"
172,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?"
173,14,3,Clerk,"I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store."
174,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?"
175,14,3,Clerk,Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
176,14,3,Randy Marsh,Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
177,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!"
178,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[munching on a breast from a bucket] Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!"
179,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!"
180,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[munching on a drumstick, his back to Billy] Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!"
181,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!"
182,14,3,Eric Cartman,"...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer."
183,14,3,Billy and his Mom,What is that supposed to mean?
184,14,3,Eric Cartman,I... [turns around to face Billy] told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
185,14,3,Billy and his Mom,[suddenly vulnerable] You wouldn't do that.
186,14,3,Eric Cartman,Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
187,14,3,Billy s Mom,Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!
188,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Bye bye Billy. [Billy leaves] Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good."
189,14,3,Randy Marsh,What do we want?
190,14,3,Men,Bigger doors!
191,14,3,Randy Marsh,Where do we want them?
192,14,3,Men,Weed stores!
193,14,3,Randy Marsh,What do we want?
194,14,3,Men,Bigger doors!
195,14,3,Randy Marsh,Where do we want them?
196,14,3,Men,Weed stores!
197,14,3,Clerk,"Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure."
198,14,3,Man 1,Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
199,14,3,Man 2,"Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others."
200,14,3,Clerk,"Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous."
201,14,3,Man 3,What's ridiculous about it?
202,14,3,Dr Doctor,"[runs through the crowd] Hold on, hold people people, please! [stops] We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!"
203,14,3,Tough Boy 2,"Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff."
204,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!"
205,14,3,Tough Boy 3,"Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed."
206,14,3,Eric Cartman,"What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay. [leaves the throne] Put him on speaker."
207,14,3,The Colonel,Hello. Hello??
208,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Colonel, how are you doing?"
209,14,3,The Colonel,What happened?
210,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[rips the skin off a breast and lays it on the table] Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? [takes out a credit card and starts mincing the skin as if it were crack cocaine, into lines of finely ground skin]"
211,14,3,The Colonel,"Eric, what happened??"
212,14,3,Eric Cartman,We had a little problem.
213,14,3,The Colonel,I heard.
214,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[snorts a line into his nose] Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?"
215,14,3,The Colonel,"Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!"
216,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time."
217,14,3,The Colonel,There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
218,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, take it easy Colonel."
219,14,3,The Colonel,"I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!"
220,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[grabs the phone] Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?! [hears someone breaking in and looks over his shoulder] Oh crap! [five men pour into the basement and start firing their machine guns at the boys, who scatter and try to escape. Two more men jump into the basement. More men outside the house begin firing their weapons. The police arrive and begin firing at the attackers]"
221,14,3,Officer Barbrady,Freeze!
222,14,3,Henchman,"It's the cops! [Barbrady kills him. Another attacker is killed nearby. Cartman looks outside from the basement and begins his escape. Billy and his mom begin their escape as well, but through the front door]"
223,14,3,Billy s Mom,"Run Billy, run! [a bullet kills her. Cartman leaves the basement and escapes]"
224,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"Mommy, no!"
225,14,3,Officer Barbrady,"Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. [the crowd cheers, and Dr. Doctor takes the mic]"
226,14,3,Dr Doctor,"And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. [the store has been renamed MFC - Medicinal Fried Chicken]"
227,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. [Sharon folds her arms and looks up and away angrily]"
228,14,3,Sharon Marsh,Yeah. Great.
229,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. [reaches into a bag and pulls out a flesh-colored winter coat. Sharon looks at it and grins instantly]"
230,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, I love it! [puts it on and strikes a few poses]"
231,14,3,Randy Marsh,And when it gets cold it shrinks. [two women approach them]
232,14,3,Woman 4,"Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?"
233,14,3,Sharon Marsh,Yyyup!
234,14,3,Woman 5,Luckyyyyy!
