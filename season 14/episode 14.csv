21,14,14,Randy Marsh,No!
22,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made."
23,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking! [grabs his coat and heads for the garage.

55,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Channel blocked? [begins clicking channels] What the? The hell? [goes to the master bedroom and finds Sharon clicking away on another remote control] Sharon, what are you doing?"
56,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
57,14,14,Randy Marsh,I wasn't watching food channels!
58,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Then how do you know I blocked them?
59,14,14,Randy Marsh,"I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! [walks away thwarted and goes to his den. He picks up a cordless phone on the way. He leaves the lights off in there and walks to his desk, dialing a number. He sits down as his call is answered]"
60,14,14,Hotline Man,"Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say ""crème fraîche."""

63,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?"
64,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline",I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
65,14,14,Randy Marsh,[piqued] Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
66,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes."
67,14,14,Randy Marsh,Yeah?
68,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet."
69,14,14,Randy Marsh,You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
70,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline",Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
71,14,14,Randy Marsh,"If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan."
72,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard. [upstairs Sharon picks up the phone to make a call, but she hears the conversation and stops to listen]"
73,14,14,Randy Marsh,Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
74,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","I was thinking about shallots, actually."
75,14,14,Randy Marsh,Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
76,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Randy! Marsh!
77,14,14,Randy Marsh,WAH! Sharon!
78,14,14,Hotline Man,"Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say ""crème fraîche."""
79,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop."
80,14,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Sharon, I'm so sorry."
81,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all."
82,14,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon."
83,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
84,14,14,Sheila Broflovski,There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
85,14,14,"Michael, BB&B Associate",Help you find anything? [the name tag says Michael]
86,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?"
87,14,14,Michael,Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?
88,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
89,14,14,Michael,"Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out. [the woman is having some difficulty with the large Shake Weight]"
90,14,14,Sharon Marsh,I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
91,14,14,Michael,"Small white ones, yes ma'am. [picks up two different models] Standard or voice assist model?"
92,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Well I don't know-
93,14,14,Michael,I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.
94,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms. [Sharon switches arms] Wow. Good job. [Sharon begins to gasp for air] You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting.
95,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Thank you, Shake Weight."
96,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"Come on now. Almost finished. [Sharon begins to shake the weight faster] Yes. Good. Almost done. [Sharon shakes the weight even faster and begins to grunt] Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Faster. [Sharon's giving it all she's got, and a bell sounds. She gets two squirts]"
97,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Hahhh.
98,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Your workout is finished. [a different bell sounds and Sharon twists the Shake Weight around to get some change] Here is some cab fare.
99,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Oh wow.
100,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]
101,14,14,Stan Marsh,"You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!"
102,14,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. [the line moves forward and the boys enter to see... Randy as the school chef]"
103,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Hello there, children!"
104,14,14,Stan Marsh,Awww what?!
105,14,14,Randy Marsh,How's it goin'? [behind him is restaurant-quality cooking equipment]
106,14,14,Stan Marsh,"No, dad! No!"
107,14,14,Randy Marsh,The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
108,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!"
109,14,14,Randy Marsh,"I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche."
110,14,14,Eric Cartman,Lobster foam? [Stan shuts his eyes and buries his nose in his right hand] It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
111,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli."
112,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!"
113,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion! [starts spreading the aioli over the pizza] Ooo yeah, fuck yeah."
114,14,14,Stan Marsh,Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
115,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
116,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!"
117,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"You think your father's gonna listen to me?! [something begins to beep nearby and Sharon looks at it, then goes to the breakfast table. On it is the beeping Shake Weight]"
118,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.
119,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Oh. [picks up the weight and begins to shake it] This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
120,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"That's it. Work it. Harder, faster."
121,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!"
122,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[sighs] Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! [Stan just looks at her now]"
123,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are independent and strong.
124,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
125,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Switch arms.
126,14,14,Sharon Marsh,[switch] I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
127,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger. [Sharon puts her left index finger into the device.] Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five. [Sharon shakes the weight harder] Faster. Harder.
128,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh [in an Italian accent] mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche."
129,14,14,Randy Singing,La lalala la la...
130,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[glazing some marbled beef] Aww, fuck yeah. [next he chops onions]"
131,14,14,Randy Singing,"Lalalalala la, fraîche, fraîche."
132,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[sniffing the aroma of freshly cooked turkey surrounded by russet potatoes] Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... [takes a small torch to some quiches, shows off a new dish on a fancy plate on a regular tray, squirts out some dinner roll batter on a cooking sheet, grinds some pepper onto a baked ham, flambés some shrimp, checks out some pork chops he's got cooking in the oven and likes what he sees]"
133,14,14,Randy Singing,"Crème fraîche, Cafeteria Fraîche. Lalalalala fraîche. Ho ho hohoho."
134,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, what are you doing?"
135,14,14,Randy Singing,[as his head floats across the screen] Fraîche. [a logo finally shows up]
136,14,14,Randy Marsh,Fraîche.
137,14,14,Randy Singing,Cafeteria Fraîche.
138,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan. [does so] Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh..."
139,14,14,Craig Tucker,"Can we have some food, please? [behind him stand Craig, Kevin, and some more fourth graders]"
140,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche. [the crew is shown: Stan operates the camera, Kyle the boom mike, Cartman and Kenny the klieg lights. Randy grates the cheese over the ziti] Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah."
141,14,14,Stan Marsh,Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
142,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Quiet on set, please."
143,14,14,Stan Marsh,"No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!"
144,14,14,Randy Marsh,[distracted] Back from where?
145,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this."
146,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.
147,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, thanks Shake Weight."
148,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.
149,14,14,Sharon Marsh,You're right.
150,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Tell me again about the women who you do not like.
151,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all."
152,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful. [two beeps] How about a quick workout?
153,14,14,Sharon Marsh,[takes off her sunglasses] A workout? Right now?
154,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Just a quickie. You can do it.
155,14,14,Sharon Marsh,I don't really like working out in public.
156,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"Come on. You can do it. [Sharon thinks about it, then picks up the weight with her left hand and shakes it. At first she keeps it at a distance, but soon shakes it normally] That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster. [Sharon does as told] You are amazing. Switch arms. [Sharon switches] Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster. [Sharon does as told] I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes. [a ring and two squirts] Your workout is finished. Your cab fare. [pours out some fare onto Sharon's left hand] Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]"
157,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,"We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?"
158,14,14,Stan Marsh,He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
159,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,"He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay."
160,14,14,Eric Cartman,"[on stilts, dressed as Ramsay] Oy! Bebebebebebebe."
161,14,14,Stan Marsh,"That's stupid, Cartman."
162,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
163,14,14,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it's really good.)"
164,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's hear it, Cartman!"
165,14,14,Eric Cartman,"Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!"
166,14,14,Stan Marsh,"You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded."
167,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[enters the room] Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay! [backs out the door quickly and hides behind the door. Stan follows him out] Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!"
168,14,14,Stan Marsh,"...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you."
169,14,14,Randy Marsh,Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
170,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You have not worked out in seven hours.
171,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh God, not right now."
172,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Come on. Let's get to it.
173,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Ugh, I'm tired."
174,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You have not worked out in seven hours.
175,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, where is that sleep mode button?"
176,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?
177,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Ugghh.
178,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.
179,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[sighs] All right. Fine. [a few moments later, with the lights on, she begins shaking the weight]"
180,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"That's it. Good. [Sharon sighs] A little faster. Harder. [Sharon simply switches arm position, but doesn't shake any faster] Come on. Get into it. That's it. Now switch arms. [Sharon switches] You are so attractive and you have interesting things to say. [Sharon shakes the weight faster, but soon has to support her left arm with her right hand] Come on. You are almost there. Faster. Do it faster. [ding, two squirts, some change comes out] Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]"
181,14,14,Sharon Marsh,[relieved] Ahhh.
182,14,14,Eric Cartman,"[still dressed as Ramsay] What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!"
183,14,14,Randy Marsh,Yes chef!
184,14,14,Eric Cartman,"Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!"
185,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up."
186,14,14,Randy Marsh,"No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!"
187,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! [another camera crew comes in, with another chef]"
188,14,14,Bobby Flay,"Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?"
189,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!"
190,14,14,Bobby Flay,I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!
191,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, are you serious?? [fist pump] Yes, yes!"
192,14,14,Announcer,"A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme?"
193,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Hey no, no. All you people get out of here."
194,14,14,Jamie Oliver,"[appears] Hold on. Wait. School cafeteria food needs to be healthy. [begins to cry] Why, why won't people listen to me?"
195,14,14,Randy Marsh,Jamie Oliver!
196,14,14,Announcer,"And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen [she waves], and Giata De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head."
197,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
198,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"""Your room is being serviced""? Ugh, oh well. [enters the room and finds the maid working out with the Shake Weight] Uhh, excuse me?"
199,14,14,Rosemary,"Oh, [turns around] uh no, no, [tosses the Shake Weight onto the bed] sorry. I done with cleaning, [runs to her cleaning tray and exits with it] thank you. Please, sorry. [after she leaves Sharon drops her shopping bag and walks to the bed. She crosses her arms and looks at the Shake Weight angrily]"
200,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What? [moments later Sharon is on the phone with the manufacturer]
201,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[pacing back and forth] Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!"
202,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.
203,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
204,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.
205,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!"
206,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest. [Sharon stops and glares at it.]
207,14,14,Announcer,"Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!"
208,14,14,Randy Marsh,[walking with a huge metal pot past Mario Batali] Behind you!
209,14,14,Announcer,"[looks at Giata De Laurentiis, then turns to face the camera] Whose cafeteria food will win? These chefs are cooking their hearts out and bringing their A-game to serve the kids of this elementary school. [the cafeteria is shown full of kids] These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again."
210,14,14,Jamie Oliver,[on the floor] Kids' food should be healthy. Why ain't it healthy?
211,14,14,Announcer,And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.
212,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[walking around, frantic] Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home! [leaves the kitchen, goes through the cafeteria, and leaves] I'll be right back!"
213,14,14,Announcer,The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
214,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche. [comes in through the garage and goes to the refrigerator, opens it, and rifles through the food] Where is it?! Where is it?! [goes to the sofa in the living room and takes off the cushions] Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?! [runs upstairs and into the master bedroom. He goes to the dresser and rifles through the top drawer] Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!"
215,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[appearing at the doorway] Randy, I'm back."
216,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[looks over his shoulder] Oh, thank God! [quickly walks up to her] Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??"
217,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, we should talk."
218,14,14,Randy Marsh,I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
219,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?"
220,14,14,Randy Marsh,"You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!"
221,14,14,Sharon Marsh,What'd you say?
222,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[stops searching and crosses his arms] I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!"
223,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Can I try something?
224,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned. [Stan walks into view] Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah! [Stan stops and looks at the door] Now uh, switch arms. [Stan looks away, trying to make sense of what he's hearing] Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this? [Stan figures it out, turns, and walks away] You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time. [yawns] Ugh, I'm tired."
225,14,14,Sharon Marsh,You gonna go back to the kitchen?
226,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?"
227,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"No, I'm good, thanks. [smiles]"
228,14,14,Randy Marsh,"I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy. [closes his eyes] Love you, Sharon. [farts, and he's asleep. Sharon remembers something and goes downstairs.]"
229,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,I guess my work here is finished.
230,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?"
231,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress."
232,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"I'll remember that now, thanks to you."
233,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer."
234,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Goodbye, Shake Weight."
