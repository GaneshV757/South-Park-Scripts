0,14,2,Mr Garrison,"Okay kids, let's take our seats. [sets the box down on the desk] There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read."
1,14,2,Eric Cartman,"[sarcastically, folds his arms together] Aww, books? God, I hate those!"
2,14,2,Mr Garrison,"Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. [the book in question is J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye]"
3,14,2,Eric Cartman,Oh really? Sweet.
4,14,2,Mr Garrison,"It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqu√© parts... [begins handing out the books individually]"
5,14,2,Stan Marsh,All right!
6,14,2,Mr Garrison,...and strong vulgar language...
7,14,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Awesome, dude!)"
8,14,2,Mr Garrison,...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
9,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Oho man, I can't wait!"
10,14,2,Mr Garrison,"Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-"
11,14,2,Eric Cartman,"No on, come on, let's read it now!"
12,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?"
13,14,2,Mr Garrison,"Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! [jabs his left index finger at the floor]"
14,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!"
15,14,2,Mr Garrison,"You will read it at home, [jabs his left index finger at the floor again, then puts his palms on his hips] and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!"
16,14,2,Class,Awww!
17,14,2,Stan Marsh,Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
18,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is."
19,14,2,Stan Marsh,"[turns the page] I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times."
20,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. [the door opens and a pissed-off Cartman enters and closes the door]
21,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Motherfucker! [Kyle turns around to face him, Stan stands up and walks up to him] The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"""
22,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,[picks up his book] Why the hell was this book banned?!
23,14,2,Eric Cartman,"They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! [the door opens again and Kenny enters with his book]"
24,14,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)"
25,14,2,Eric Cartman,"We know, we were just saying that."
26,14,2,Stan Marsh,Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
27,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Kill John Lennon... [leaves his chair and walks across the kitchen] Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon... [reaches into a bottom drawer and pulls out a large steak knife] Kill John Lennon! [walks by his dad's study and stops to look in] Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?"
28,14,2,Stephen Stotch,"John Lennon's dead, Butters."
29,14,2,Butters Stotch,[lowers the knife instantly] Aww. Dangit. [drops it and walks away]
30,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene."
31,14,2,Eric Cartman,"It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!"
32,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. [Kyle breaks into a grin]"
33,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one."
34,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, sweet."
35,14,2,Kenny McCormick,(Awesome.)
36,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[starts typing] The Tale of... [can't think of anything, so his smile disappears]"
37,14,2,Eric Cartman,The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
38,14,2,Kenny McCormick,"(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)"
39,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh that's, [giggles] yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one..."
40,14,2,Eric Cartman,"It was a... a warm spring morning. [background music plays and a montage follows. Next is the school playground where, as other kids play, Stan and the other three sit on the steps of a side entrance and continue working on their book, with Cartman taking notes Next is Stan's room where Stan is typing the next part of the book. The boys are having fun with the writing. Next scene is in Cartman's room where Cartman is again writing the story down. Kyle has brought Ike over for company. Finally, a few days later, Sharon enters Stan's room to put away his clean clothes. She puts away some underwear, but notices something in the drawer. Under Stan's shirts is the manuscript to the story the boys have been working on. Sharon reaches for it.]"
41,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"""The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs""? [goes to the first page] ""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his""... [reads silently] Ew. ""He took a..."" [stunned] What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! ""He then grabbed his dog's"" [stifles a gag but can't hold it in, and barfs] Ehohoh, oh my God! ""Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered"" [tries not to barf again, but can't hold it in] Nooo! Nooo! [reads some more, but then coughs, then barfs] Noho! Nooo! [Sharon then falls unconscious and rolls on her back]"
42,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"Randy? [spots him working on a small wooden ship and runs in] Randy! Randy, you need to read this!"
43,14,2,Randy Marsh,Read what?
44,14,2,Sharon Marsh,This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
45,14,2,Randy Marsh,So?
46,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!"
47,14,2,Randy Marsh,Huh?
48,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"I mean it's disgusting. [hands the manuscript over to him] It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!"
49,14,2,Randy Marsh,"""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-"" Ew, Sharon, gross!"
50,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"Nono, just keep reading."
51,14,2,Randy Marsh,"""He took a- and then-"" Oh, man. Oh, this- [turns to his left and barfs on the floor. Sharon turns away and shields herself]"
52,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end."
53,14,2,Randy Marsh,"Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!"
54,14,2,Sharon Marsh,Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
55,14,2,Randy Marsh,"""Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-"" What? ""He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"" [barfs again. He spends a couple hours more reading, and finally reaches the last few pages. There's a pail in front of him now, but the vomit has gone all over the place. He has a small towel in his left hand covered in vomit. His voice is now soft and beat] ""That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest."" Oh... Oh, man."
56,14,2,Sharon Marsh,Well?
57,14,2,Randy Marsh,It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
58,14,2,Sharon Marsh,Right? It's not just me.
59,14,2,Randy Marsh,"No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!"
60,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean."
61,14,2,Randy Marsh,"NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff."
62,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!"
63,14,2,Stan Marsh,"[runs into the living room in a panic] Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!"
64,14,2,Eric Cartman,...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
65,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!"
66,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!"
67,14,2,Eric Cartman,"And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!"
68,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, somebody has got to go down!"
69,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, what are you up to?"
70,14,2,Butters Stotch,Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
71,14,2,Kim Kardashian,Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!
72,14,2,Butters Stotch,Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
73,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!"
74,14,2,Butters Stotch,I am?
75,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it."
76,14,2,Butters Stotch,Oh no. Which book was that?
77,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!"
78,14,2,Butters Stotch,I don't even remember that. [gasps] But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
79,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this."
80,14,2,Sheila Broflovski,We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
81,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. [Butters walks in hanging his head]"
82,14,2,Eric Cartman,That's right.
83,14,2,Randy Marsh,Butters? Is that true?
84,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did."
85,14,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read."
86,14,2,Butters Stotch,Huh?
87,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,What? [the other boys can't believe it]
88,14,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, it's really amazing."
89,14,2,Butters Stotch,"[brightens up] Oh, thanks."
90,14,2,Sheila Broflovski,"We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it."
91,14,2,Mr Needlebaum,"Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel."
92,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!"
93,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we wrote that!"
94,14,2,Randy Marsh,"Ohkay boys, you already told the truth."
95,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters."
96,14,2,Butters Stotch,I wrote that. [the adults begin to murmur amongst themselves]
97,14,2,Stephen Stotch,Really amazing.
98,14,2,Stan Marsh,What? Hey! [Butters is pleased for once]
99,14,2,A News Anchor,"It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called ""literary genius."" The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting."
100,14,2,A News Anchor,The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages.
101,14,2,A News Anchor,"The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. [a picture of Butters in a pensive pose pops up]"
102,14,2,Clyde,"Hey, here he comes!"
103,14,2,Mr Adler,"Amazing book, Butters. [Mr. Garrison comes out of his classroom]"
104,14,2,Butters Stotch,Thank you! [clasps his hands together and congratulates himself as he walks down the hallway]
105,14,2,Mrs Streibel,"You've changed my life, young man."
106,14,2,Butters Stotch,"That's nice. [waves to everyone and walks on, but runs into Stan and the boys, who are mad at him]"
107,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!"
108,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?"
109,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!"
110,14,2,Butters Stotch,"But, you told me I did!"
111,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! [two girls rush up to Butters' aid]"
112,14,2,Red,"Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist."
113,14,2,Lola,He's so brooding and full of angst.
114,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I'm broooding."
115,14,2,Eric Cartman,Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
116,14,2,Rebecca,"Oh God, you guys are pathetic!"
117,14,2,Lola,"Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once. [the girls leave]"
118,14,2,Stan Marsh,God-damnit!
119,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-"
120,14,2,Butters Stotch,"No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!"
121,14,2,Eric Cartman,That inconsiderate jerk!
122,14,2,An Announcer,"Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, ""How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook"" [the studio audience joins in] ""And Not Vomit?"" [a contestant is fitted with headphones and place in a soundproof booth. The front panel is a glass door so the audience can see the contestant's reaction without getting sprayed with vomit. It only takes two seconds of listening before the contestant vomits all over the door] The book is full of disgusting words and acts, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times. [a shot of Parker and her date at the Oscars] Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book?"
123,14,2,Matthew Broderick,"Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me."
124,14,2,An Announcer,"Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress? [cut to a shot of the Stotch family sitting in Butters' room]"
125,14,2,Matt Lauer,"Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents."
126,14,2,Stephen Stotch,Hello Matt
127,14,2,Linda Stotch,Hi everyone.
128,14,2,Matt Lauer,You must be pretty proud of your son.
129,14,2,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented."
130,14,2,Meredith Vieira,And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?
131,14,2,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course."
132,14,2,Butters Stotch,I have to come right to my room after school.
133,14,2,Stephen Stotch,But we are very very proud nonetheless.
134,14,2,Al Roker,"[chuckles] Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?"
135,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly."
136,14,2,Matt Lauer,"All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's [jumps off his stool and tries to vomit into a pail nearby, but misses. He vomits agin and this time gets it into the pail, burps, and coughs a few times, getting the last of the vomit into the pail, and finally spits. He gets back on the stool] Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?"
137,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so."
138,14,2,Meredith Vieira,Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings? [begins to vomit immediately]
139,14,2,Al Roker,"Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?"
140,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh. [gets into a trance] Kill Ronald Reagan. [hops off his bed and heads for the door] Kill Ronald Reagan."
141,14,2,Al Roker,"Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters."
142,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh really? [goes back to his bed] Oh yeah, gosh dangit."
143,14,2,Stan Marsh,"More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!"
144,14,2,Assemblyman 1,That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
145,14,2,Eric Cartman,There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
146,14,2,Assemblyman 2,You just fail to understand what the author meant.
147,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
148,14,2,Assemblyman 3,"[chuckles] No, no no, that's such a simplistic view."
149,14,2,Stan Marsh,Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
150,14,2,Assemblywoman 1,"Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?"
151,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yes!
152,14,2,Assemblywoman 1,But what would be the point?
153,14,2,Eric Cartman,There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
154,14,2,Assemblywoman 2,No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.
155,14,2,Stan Marsh,Yes they would!
156,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yes they would!
157,14,2,Eric Cartman,Yes they would!
158,14,2,Assemblywoman 2,It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.
159,14,2,Stan Marsh,"What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!"
160,14,2,Assemblyman 2,"Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country."
161,14,2,Stan Marsh,What?
162,14,2,Assemblywoman 2,"Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!"
163,14,2,Assemblyman 2,What book did you read?!
164,14,2,Stan Marsh,There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
165,14,2,Assemblyman 4,"Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake? [an assemblyman nearby throws up]"
166,14,2,A Field Reporter,"Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room. [The reporter and Butters are yelling at each other to be heard.]"
167,14,2,A Field Reporter,Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
168,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!"
169,14,2,A Field Reporter,Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
170,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!"
171,14,2,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!"
172,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. [walks out of view]"
173,14,2,Stan Marsh,I can't believe they won't ban our book!
174,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
175,14,2,Kenny McCormick,(It's fucking disgusting!)
176,14,2,Eric Cartman,"All right you guys, I know what we have to do. [stands up and walks onto the street] We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker."
177,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,What?! [Stan's hands go from his chin to his knees]
178,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned."
179,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! [Sarah Jessica Parker hears her name and looks at the boys]"
180,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Shhh. [addresses Ms. Parker] Be right with you. [hushed tones to the other boys] We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed."
181,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. [he and Kyle walk away]"
182,14,2,Eric Cartman,Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
183,14,2,Kenny McCormick,"[looks over at Ms. Parker, then at Cartman] (Okay.)"
184,14,2,Eric Cartman,"[turns and walks over to Ms. Parker] Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. [Kenny follows.]"
185,14,2,Matt Lauer,"Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed."
186,14,2,Meredith Vieira,"Al, how is it out there?"
187,14,2,Al Roker,"[giggles] I don't know if you could see this, guys, but uh, the line stretches all the way around the block. People waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel. [the camera pans across the line from front to back and back again. The people in line smile and wave at the camera] And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith."
188,14,2,Meredith Vieira,"Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat."
189,14,2,Matt Lauer,"That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman."
190,14,2,Morgan Freeman,"[reading slowly, with gravitas] The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, ""I need to poop."" ""Okay,"" Rebecca replied, ""I like poop."" Douglas squatted down [turns the page] over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener. [turns the page] Chapter 2..."
191,14,2,Eric Cartman,See any hunters yet?
192,14,2,Kenny McCormick,(Not yet) [Ms. Parker is in a nearby clearing with moose horns attached to her head]
193,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there."
194,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, stop, stop! [Kyle and Stan walk into view towards Cartman and Kenny] We don't have to do this!"
195,14,2,Kenny McCormick,(Huh?)
196,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,Butters wrote a second book!
197,14,2,Eric Cartman,So what?
198,14,2,Stan Marsh,"So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!"
199,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,We can get people to believe us now!
200,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh dude, sweet! [all four boys walk away, leaving Ms. Parker all alone at the mercy of any moose hunter that walks by her]"
201,14,2,Morgan Freeman,"""Why are we here?"" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all."
202,14,2,Shopper 1,"""The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs."""
203,14,2,Shopper 2,"""And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt."""
204,14,2,Stan Marsh,"[in store with the other boys] Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. [grins]"
205,14,2,Eric Cartman,People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
206,14,2,Shopper 3,"Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?"
207,14,2,Some Woman Named Marsha,"So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book."
208,14,2,Shopper 4,"I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots."
209,14,2,Eric Cartman,What?!
210,14,2,Stan Marsh,You can't be serious! You people like this?!
211,14,2,Shopper 5,Some of the imagery is unbelievable
212,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
213,14,2,Shopper 6,"Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh? [slides into taunting] Didn't like what the book had to say?"
214,14,2,Some Woman Named Marsha,What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!
215,14,2,Eric Cartman,Oh come on!
216,14,2,Stan Marsh,"God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!"
217,14,2,Shopper 7,"""And the poop and the pee lived happily every after. The end."" [closes the book...] Kill the phonies. Kill the phonies!"
218,14,2,Kim Kardashian,Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.
219,14,2,The rest of the Kardashians,Yaaay!
220,14,2,Male Guest,Can I go with you girls? [the seventh shopper breaks into the set and guns everyone down]
221,14,2,News Anchor 2,"Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians.. [cries a bit and sheds a tear] wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book."
222,14,2,News Anchor 2,Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK! [the anchorman falls silent and the door opens. Cartman and the other boys enter]
223,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters."
224,14,2,Butters Stotch,I know.
225,14,2,Stan Marsh,"They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!"
226,14,2,Butters Stotch,[lifts his head up. He's been crying] You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
227,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah... Oh Butters, [steps forward] it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning."
228,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television."
229,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this."
230,14,2,Eric Cartman,"That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something."
231,14,2,Butters Stotch,What?
232,14,2,Eric Cartman,[sighs heavily] You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
233,14,2,Butters Stotch,What?! Oh no!
234,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. [walks out of the room with the other boys]"
235,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. [leaves his desk and follows the other boys downstairs]"
