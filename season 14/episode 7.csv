0,14,7,Towelie,"[walking down the street being friendly] Hey everybody, how's it goin'?"
1,14,7,Towelie,[taking a hit from a bong] I just... I just can't seem to stop.
2,14,7,Towelie,Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. [coughs]
3,14,7,Towelie,"[stumbling around, tattered and wasted] Get out of my face! Get out of here! [runs at the camera and shoves it out of his face. The camera spins around in a blur of lights]"
4,14,7,Towelie,"[in studio] My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills. [a man spills his drink in a mall and Towelie throws himself at it, soaking it up. Next, he sends himself into a washing machine at a laundromat] And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways. [hangs himself up to dry on a clothesline in someone's backyard] Except for one. [back to the studio] I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. [next scene is a wasted Towelie taking another hit from his bong]"
5,14,7,Towelie,"[scorched and wasted, walks down the street] Hey buddy, want your dick sucked? [bends over for a moment] Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?"
6,14,7,Stan Marsh,"Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!"
7,14,7,Kyle Broflovski,"If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im."
8,14,7,Butters Stotch,"[cries, taking a tissue from the box next to him] Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!"
9,14,7,Stan Marsh,"There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! [Towelie is shown lighting a joint as the camera pulls away]"
10,14,7,Singers,"Are you ready for the summer?
Are you ready for the good times?
Are you ready for the birds and bees?
The apple trees?
And a whole lot of fooling around?

11,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year."
12,14,7,Timmy Burch,Timmeh!
13,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,"We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!"
14,14,7,Frances,"[practicing how to light a fire with a stick, a bow, and a small board] Hi Jimmy, hi Tim."
15,14,7,Timmy Burch,"[waves, grinning] Timmy."
16,14,7,Specialist 1,"Wow, look at Lenora everyone. [Lenora dog-paddles her way to the shore] Good job. Come on, good job Lenora. Ahahall right, good, let's get Lenora a towel. [Lenora begins to shiver. The song ends at this point] Come on, come on, where's the towel?"
17,14,7,Specialist 2,[looks inside the towel cart] The towel isn't here. I think it's off getting high again.
18,14,7,Specialist 3,"[walks nearby looking for him] Hey! [startled, Towelie lets the rubber band snap off and fall to the ground] Where is that towel?!"
19,14,7,Towelie,"Oh yeah, just a sec. [the specialist sees him]"
20,14,7,Stan Marsh,[in studio] We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us! [crosses his arms] Stupid towel!
21,14,7,Specialist 3,"[now next to Towelie] What's going on, Towel?"
22,14,7,Towelie,Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
23,14,7,Specialist 3,We got wet campers down there! Move your ass!
24,14,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[in studio] When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything."
25,14,7,Towelie,[now wasted and tattered] I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. [walks by a campfire circle where Jimmy is holding court with his team]
26,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition."
27,14,7,Elmer Fudd,"Oh we're weady aww wight. We can weawwy stick it to the wed team this yeaw, wahahahaha."
28,14,7,Beaky Buzzard,"No way, Red Team can beat us, no way. Haha, hahaha."
29,14,7,Droopy Dawg,Red Team won't know what hit them.
30,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
31,14,7,Blue Team,Yeah!
32,14,7,Timmy Burch,Timmy!
33,14,7,Blue Team,Yeah! [a couple of members go on separately] Alright!
34,14,7,Nathan,"I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl."
35,14,7,Mimsy,"Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha."
36,14,7,Nathan,"[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy!"
37,14,7,Mimsy,"Doh, sorry, boss."
38,14,7,Nathan,Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
39,14,7,Nathan,"What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete."
40,14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?"
41,14,7,Nathan,"[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him."
42,14,7,Specialist 1,"There you go, Lenora, all better now?"
43,14,7,Lenora,"Yes, thanks."
44,14,7,Towelie,"That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... [throws up all over Lenora]"
45,14,7,Lenora,Uhhh!
46,14,7,Specialist 3,"Who hired that towel? It can barely walk, let alone dry somebody off."
47,14,7,Towelie,[picking a fight] You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
48,14,7,Stan Marsh,"[in studio] A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody."
49,14,7,Towelie,"You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! [walks off in disgust]"
50,14,7,Butters Stotch,"[in studio, sobbing] The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked. [a picture of the couple is shown, but her face is blurry. The picture was taken at a restaurant booth] And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth. [A picture of the three of them at the hospital. She shows off Washcloth, but her face is still blurry] Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house."
51,14,7,Towelie,"[wasted. wandering in the woods] Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!"
52,14,7,Towelie,No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday! [the anger leaves his face] Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
53,14,7,Specialist 1,"[over the megaphone] All right, campers! Our first event is the big canoe race!"
54,14,7,Pete Puma,"Oh boy, the canoe races! Heeee! [the team turns right and walks away]"
55,14,7,Porky Pig,"We gotta be uh bitty bitty uh we uh we gotta be we gotta be uh we gotta bibbity beat the Red Team. [turns and walks off with the others. Nearby, Nathan and Mimsy listen in again]"
56,14,7,Nathan,"I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good."
57,14,7,Mimsy,"Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?"
58,14,7,Nathan,"Simple, Mimsy, [pulls out a bag with something in it] We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe."
59,14,7,Mimsy,"Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh? [Nathan pulls a snake out of the bag by its head] Oh! It's a snake."
60,14,7,Nathan,"Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a Black Mamba."
61,14,7,Mimsy,"Aww, dah, jee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? [Nathan shushes him]"
62,14,7,Specialist 4,You boys excited for the canoe race?
63,14,7,Nathan,"Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe."
64,14,7,Specialist 4,"[encouraged] Canoes are fun, aren't day? [walks away]"
65,14,7,Nathan,"[now that the counselor is gone...] Now take the Black Mamba, [hands the bag to Mimsy] Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready."
66,14,7,Specialist 1,"All right, campers are we ready?"
67,14,7,All,Yeah!
68,14,7,Nathan,"Good luck, Jimmy."
69,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,"You too, Ne-n-Nathan."
70,14,7,Nathan,"You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole."
71,14,7,Specialist 1,"Oh your mark, get set. [shoots off her gun, and both boats take off. Nathan switches his oar to his right side, but notices something on the floor: the Black Mamba Mimsy was to put in the other canoe.]"
72,14,7,Nathan,"Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!"
73,14,7,Mimsy,"Darrr, you said to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss."

[kicks the door in and is instantly shocked at what he sees: Towelie on his knees in front of an elderly man who's pulling up his pants]
78,14,7,Towelie,"Hey, you own me money, asshole!"
79,14,7,Specialist 1,"That's it, we're done! You are no longer employed here!"
80,14,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, sir."

83,14,7,Specialist 3,"All right campers, next event is the big scavenger hunt! Blue Team is gonna go first. [Nathan and Mimsy stand nearby, overhearing the specialist]"
84,14,7,Nathan,"I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team."
85,14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh boss?"
86,14,7,Nathan,"Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans. [reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a map] Here, take this. [Mimsy takes it and opens it up] It's a fake scavenger hunt map."
87,14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?"
88,14,7,Nathan,"No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation."
89,14,7,Mimsy,"Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? [again Nathan shushes him as a specialist draws near to them]"
90,14,7,Counselor Steve,Are you boys excited for the neat scavenger hunt?
91,14,7,Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt. [Steve walks away] Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!"
92,14,7,Mimsy,"I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map. [walks away]"
93,14,7,Mimsy,"Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?"
94,14,7,Nathan,"Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too."
95,14,7,Mimsy,Dahhhoh boy!
96,14,7,Nathan,"This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. ""Turn left at the..."" Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the? [finds his way onto the Tardicaca Burial Grounds] Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!"
97,14,7,Mimsy,"Why sure it is, boss."
98,14,7,Nathan,I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
99,14,7,Mimsy,"No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. [his motions indicate he just flipped the map this way and that]"
100,14,7,Nathan,"Miiimmmssssyyyy! [all of a sudden, Indians appear on horseback.] Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled. [the Indians fire at him and arrows go flying all over the place. He's struck a few times.] AAAAA!"
101,14,7,Towelie,Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. [inside he grabs as many bottles of computer duster as he can]
102,14,7,Cashier,You must have one dusty computer.
103,14,7,Towelie,"[irritated] Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch! [goes to his red car outside, gets in, and closes the door. Inside he takes out a bottle of computer duster and starts sniffing. He goes through bottle after bottle, screwing up his face more and more] I feel like I could conquer the world."
104,14,7,Towelie,[taking a short break from his sniffing] It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.
105,14,7,Butters Stotch,"[in studio] I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance. [at the Supply Max parking lot, walks up and kicks the door on Towelie's car] Towelie! Open the door!"
106,14,7,Towelie,Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!

113,14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?"
114,14,7,Nathan,"Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark. [pulls out a small box in which is a whistle. He opens the box and takes out the whistle, and hads it to Mimsy] Here, take this. [Mimsy takes it, and Nathan puts the box back in his back pocket] It's a shark-mating whistle."
115,14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'"
116,14,7,Nathan,"No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf."
117,14,7,Mimsy,Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off. [getting excited] Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. [Nathan shushes him again as Steve walks by]

132,14,7,Nathan,"Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you."
133,14,7,Mimsy,"Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle. [blows hard into the whistle]"

139,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"You wanna come over, have a seat with your friends? [Butters takes a seat between Kyle and Cartman, making space for Towelie to sit between him and Kyle. Towelie follows Butters to the sofa]"
140,14,7,Towelie,What is everybody doing here?
141,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"We've all just been talking, Towelie, and and what I'm hearing is a bunch of people here who just love the heck outtaya. And, they're gonna way what they wanna say, and you're gonna say what you wanna say, and we're done. Okay?"
142,14,7,Butters Stotch,"[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways."
143,14,7,Towelie,"Aw Jesus, man."
144,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Ah ah Towelie, you need to let him finish."
145,14,7,Butters Stotch,"You're not the towel you used to be. [sniffles] Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?"
146,14,7,Towelie,"I I don't, I don't get this."
147,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,Kyle?
148,14,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men."
149,14,7,Towelie,Could we just end this please?
150,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"You have to let him finish, Towelie."
151,14,7,Kyle Broflovski,If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
152,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next?"
153,14,7,Eric Cartman,"[reads his note] Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-."

160,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Kyle please, It is not your turn!"
161,14,7,Eric Cartman,"[takes his note back. Kyle walks back to his seat] You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.
