0,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""? [Gerald and Sheila pause. They look at each other, then turn back to their son]"
1,14,9,Gerald Broflovski,[confused] Muff cabbage?
2,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,[also confused] Where did you hear that?
3,14,9,Ike Broflovski,Muff cabbage!
4,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage""."
5,14,9,Ike Broflovski,Muff cabbage.
6,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,A new family moved in? Where are they from?
7,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,She said they're from New Jersey.
8,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,[drops her fork] New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
9,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
10,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[fearful, quickly leaves her chair and walks off a bit] Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?"
11,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Know what, Ma?"
12,14,9,Ike Broflovski,Muff cabbage!
13,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,Never invite a New Jersey housewife into your home.
14,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","[at the head of the table. Sharon is to her right] And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!"
15,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me."
16,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
17,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Linda, huh?"
18,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage! [the girls at the table just look on and continue eating] I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you got a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!
19,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","[as Teresa rattles on] So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?"
20,14,9,Randy Marsh,I don't really work out.
21,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Well, I gotta find somethin'. [flexes his left biceps] My biceps are goin' flat."
22,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?"
23,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah."
24,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Ears out to here! [spreads her arms out as far as they could go] So I tell her, ""You got big ears, sweetie."" I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? [to Sharon] I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections."
25,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. [Teresa's expression changes to a dark mood]"
26,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No."
27,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution... [slams her hands on the table] ...whore! You probably sell your muff... [slams her hands on the table] ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you! [lifts the table, which causes it to dump the food on the floor. Sharon quickly hides behind Randy] You're nothin' but garbage! [Joe comes up and restrains her from behind] That's what you are! You're garbage! [Stan's eyes dart back and forth] You sick, old woman! Muff garbage! [Joe takes her into the kitchen] Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!"
28,14,9,Sharon Marsh,Wow.
29,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! [to Joe] Okay, I love you."
30,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Take it easy.
31,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",I love you. [they kiss] I love you.
32,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am. [she takes Joe's hand and walks him back into the dining room] Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine."
33,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Meeee!"
34,14,9,Stan Marsh,You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
35,14,9,Eric Cartman,"You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep."
36,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,[glaring at him] Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
37,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Oops, busted. [avoids eye contact]"
38,14,9,Stan Marsh,"They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, ""Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."""
39,14,9,Jersey Man 2,"Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey."
40,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Aw, crap, there's more of them?"
41,14,9,Jersey Man 2,"'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey? [a lot of people respond excitedly]"
42,14,9,Steve Last Call,"So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, ""Who's from Jersey?"", and people are all like, ""Yo! Woo-hoo!"" Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler. [the restaurant is transformed into a club]"
43,14,9,Jersey Woman,"[nude in a in a Jacuzzi] Yeah, let's get this party started. [a random fight breaks out]"
44,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where the hell are they coming from?! [a bottle of Corona beer lands in front of the boys and shatters]
45,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
46,14,9,Woman 1,"Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!"
47,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage! [Sharon walks into the salon. Teresa gets up to greet her] Oh, Sharon! [they hug] Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey."
48,14,9,"Jacqueline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",And Sicilian.
49,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",That's Danielle. She's from Jersey. [Danielle is extremely tanned] And that's Caroline.
50,14,9,"Caroline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.
51,14,9,Salon Girl,"I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down? [Teresa didn't like that request]"
52,14,9,"Jacqueline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit."
53,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
54,14,9,"Caroline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Teresa! Calm down.
55,14,9,Salon Girl,I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!
56,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Get her, Sharon!"
57,14,9,Sharon Marsh,What?
58,14,9,"Jacqueline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Sharon, just stay out of it!"
59,14,9,"Caroline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Be the bigger person, Sharon!"
60,14,9,Sharon Marsh,You people are crazy.
61,14,9,"Caroline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?! [grabs Sharon by the hair as she screams] Is my family crazy?!
62,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch! [pulls Sharon back by the hair]"
63,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[barges in ready to fight] Let go of her, you piece of trash! [the other ladies turn to look]"
64,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Who the fuck are you to tell ME what to do?!
65,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,[walks up to the women] All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
66,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Psycho bitch!
67,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[slaps her hand away] No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho biiitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! [the Jersey women begin to leave]"
68,14,9,"Jacqueline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",[turns to look at Sheila] You're cabbage! [then leaves]
69,14,9,Sharon Marsh,Sheila?
70,14,9,Randy Marsh,"People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. [this includes Puerto Rica and Cuba]"
71,14,9,Mr Garrison,Jesus! Why are they doing this?
72,14,9,Randy Marsh,"More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey."
73,14,9,Jimbo Kern,"Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!"
74,14,9,All,Yeah!
75,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool."
76,14,9,Jimbo Kern,"How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? [Sheila is on the spot.]"
77,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey. [the adults present are Stephen and Linda Stotch, Randy and Sharon Marsh, Stuart McCormick, his wife, and Liane Cartman] Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang. [a picture of her is shown] I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face. [a picture of one such incident is shown] Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey. [turns away from the other adults] I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or or, somehow, you know, hold it against me."
78,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Sheila, who are you talking to?"
79,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. [walks away]
80,14,9,Eric Cartman,"You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!"
81,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaching] Hey, dudes."
82,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes the ball from Kenny and confronts Kyle] Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him."
83,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,What are you talking about?
84,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!"
85,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,So what?
86,14,9,Eric Cartman,So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
87,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it doesn't!"
88,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] He's from Jersey, you guys. [inches away] Let's just get away from him."
89,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
90,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!"
91,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,What's strike three?!
92,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes off Kyle's hat] You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!"
93,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut the fuck up! [takes his hat back and puts it on, then looks at the other boys] What?"
94,14,9,Stan Marsh,Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
95,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why does it matter?!
96,14,9,Stan Marsh,"No, uh, it just explains a lot."
97,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[moves Kyle aside] Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!"
98,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it isn't!"
99,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Yes, it is. It's getting oranger."
100,14,9,Stan Marsh,"Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is."
101,14,9,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
102,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you. [walks away, then turns and glares at him] And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!"
103,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No. [removes his hat] Couldn't be. [opens the top drawer of the vanity and pulls out a pair of scissors. He begins to cut his hair, slowly, then faster and faster. He gets some styling gel and rubs it into his hair. He gets a razor out to shape his eyebrows, cuts more of his hair off, rips the sleeves off his shirt, gets a bracelet and puts it on his right forearm, gets more gel and rubs a design onto his shirt, then is shocked at what he sees in the mirror] Oh, my God."
104,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,[knocks on the bathroom door] Kyle? You in there?
105,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. [goes about putting stuff away and closing all the drawers]"
106,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, open the door."
107,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Not now, Mom. Please."
108,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, this instant! One, two. [Kyle goes to the door]"
109,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, all right. [opens the door and see his mom, who's really Jerseyfied herself. He's speechless]"
110,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,I guess we need to talk.
111,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle."
112,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[enunciating] What am I, Mom?"
113,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus."
114,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,[getting scared] What are you saying?!
115,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey."
116,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,[looks at his new look] No! I don't wanna look like this!
117,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice."
118,14,9,Ike Broflovski,[walks by and looks] Aaaaiiiiihhhhh! [faints on his back]
119,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,I can hide it! [hops off the bed] Nobody ever has to know! [puts his hat back on and walks out the bedroom door] I can't ever let anybody know!
120,14,9,Announcer,"Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the ""Jersey News"" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!"
121,14,9,P Train,"What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago."
122,14,9,Reporter,"People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out. [the Giudice family is forcibly hauled out of their new home and stuffed into their car] And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops! [South Park Salon is bombed and everyone in there runs out] It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!"
123,14,9,Tan Jovi,What's up with that?!
124,14,9,P Train,What's up with that?!
125,14,9,Tan Jovi,"Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!"
126,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own."
127,14,9,Arnold Schwarzenegger,"Ve are very sore-y, but Cal-i-for-ni-a cannot afford helping you at this time."
128,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?"
129,14,9,Arnold Schwarzenegger,"No, because U-tah is between Colo-rah-do and Cal-i-for-ni-a."
130,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!"
131,14,9,Arnold Schwarzenegger,Nevada.
132,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!"
133,14,9,Eric Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?!
134,14,9,Stan Marsh,Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
135,14,9,Eric Cartman,[points to Kyle] And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy!
136,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!"
137,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!"
138,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,That's enough!
139,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!"
140,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Aaaarrghhhhhh! [runs at Cartman and pins him hard against a tree] I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! [lets go and walks away angrily. Cartman backs up a bit without saying a word, then breaks down]"
141,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[Whining] That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the treeee! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it! [Stan and Kenny walk away silently] Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?!"
142,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people! [waits for an answer] Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month! [throws his cell phone away and claps his hands free of it] That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!"
143,14,9,Stuart McCormick,We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
144,14,9,Randy Marsh,"There is no support! Every ally America ever had is... [thinks of something] Wait a minute. [strokes his chin] Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help."
145,14,9,Mr Garrison,What are you talking about?
146,14,9,Randy Marsh,We could ask Al Qaeda.
147,14,9,Stephen Stotch,[steps forward] Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
148,14,9,Randy Marsh,Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
149,14,9,Stephen Stotch,"And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!"
150,14,9,Bar Patron 1,"Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bar quick! There's trouble!"
151,14,9,Randy Marsh,People from Jersey?
152,14,9,Bar Patron 1,I don't know what the hell I saw.
153,14,9,Skeeter,It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed the cigarette machine in half.
154,14,9,Officer Barbrady,"Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. [a soft, high growl is heard and a figure runs by in the shadows, bumping into a few tables. The figure runs by again, grunting. The flashlights follow the sound and find a woman who looks like a troll cowering in a corner. Her arms are really short, her ears are elfin, her skin is orange]"
155,14,9,Bar Patron 2,"It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! [the thing moves closer to the ATM and smokes]"
156,14,9,Randy Marsh,What is it?
157,14,9,Bar Patron 2,It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. [Snooki sips from her drink and eats straight out of a pickle jar]
158,14,9,Randy Marsh,That thing is famous? Why?
159,14,9,Bar Patron 2,I don't know!
160,14,9,Jimbo Kern,"Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! [aims his shotgun and fires at her. She drops the pickle jar and it shatters.]"
161,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",[walking away from the ATM] Snooo-ki.
162,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Don't let it get away! Where is it?! [hears a sound] Who was that?! [his beam lands on Snooki, who has taken Stephen Stotch down and is raping him]"
163,14,9,Stephen Stotch,Aaagh! Get it off of me!
164,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",[raping him] Snooki smoosh.
165,14,9,Stephen Stotch,"Shoot it! [another gunshot is heard and Snooki heads for a window and jumps out through it, running away]"
166,14,9,Eric Cartman,"So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open."
167,14,9,Butters Stotch,Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
168,14,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler. [Kyle is cleaning his rifle nearby and lifts his head to see what the other boys are doing] Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh? [Kyle returns to cleaning his rifle. Cartman then moves to the opposite side of the circle] He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!"
169,14,9,Butters Stotch,Are you being serious?
170,14,9,Eric Cartman,"This is very serious, Butters."
171,14,9,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die."
172,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?! [Kyle looks up again. Cartman notices and turns to look back at him] Hey, Kyle. [stretches] Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh. [turns around and goes into a low voice as Kyle watches from nearby] We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up."
173,14,9,Operative,"[walks up to bin Laden with a package] Istagia makuman? [bin Laden turns around and takes the package, which is a video tape. He puts it into a tape player and watches the video. Randy pops up onscreen]"
174,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. [Jersey Shore's live-action show open begins to play]"
175,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
176,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you guys, hurry!"
177,14,9,Stan Marsh,"[climbs in behind him] Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?"
178,14,9,Eric Cartman,"I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!"
179,14,9,Kenny McCormick,[climbs in behind Stan] (What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) [Kyle climbs in last]
180,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[leads them to a spot] Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool. [stops] It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out."
181,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,[looks at Cartman for a few seconds] Why?
182,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!"
183,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
184,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh."
185,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
186,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights! [the lights go on and the fourth graders Cartman was talking to earlier pop into view] Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! [the group of six come up and take Kyle away]"
187,14,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are you doing?"
188,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[stops Stan and Kenny in their tracks] Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. [rushes up to the freezer door] Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted."
189,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll... [his expression changes quickly] Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?"
190,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!"
191,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you?"
192,14,9,Eric Cartman,You ginger Jersey Jew! [Snooki rises up behind him] Your tactics don't work on me!
193,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
194,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[looks over his shoulder, then looks back at the other boys] Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?"
195,14,9,Stephen Stotch,"Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?"
196,14,9,Mr Garrison,He's still questioning that new prisoner.
197,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!"
198,14,9,"The Situation (from ""Jersey Shore"")","Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him hard on the left cheek]"
199,14,9,Randy Marsh,What does that mean?!
200,14,9,"The Situation (from ""Jersey Shore"")","You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him again, kicks him with the left foot, punches him with the left hand, kicks him on the side of his head with the right foot]"
201,14,9,Randy Marsh,Stop playing stupid!
202,14,9,Jimbo Kern,"Maybe he really is stupid, Randy."
203,14,9,Randy Marsh,[shoots back at Jimbo] Nobody's this stupid! [turns to The Situation again] What are you people planning?!
204,14,9,"The Situation (from ""Jersey Shore"")","It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it. [Randy punches him again with the left hand, kicks him with the left foot, delivers a roundhouse kick with the right foot, flips over him and kicks him on the back of the head]"
205,14,9,Gerald Broflovski,[keeping a lookout atop the barricade] Here they come! [the adults get into position]
206,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Is it them, Randy?"
207,14,9,Randy Marsh,Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
208,14,9,Jersey People,Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!
209,14,9,Jersey Man 2,Let's go creepin' in this town!
210,14,9,Jersey Woman,[to another woman] Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!
211,14,9,Randy Marsh,This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! [some people cheer]
212,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Fuck New Jersey! [some people cheer and begin firing. The advancing Jersey folk begin to fall one by one] Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!"
213,14,9,DogPoo Petuski,[Screaming] Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
214,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
215,14,9,Stan Marsh,"[tries to get out, but finds the doors locked] Try to find a way past it!"
216,14,9,Eric Cartman,What does it want?!
217,14,9,Butters Stotch,Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
218,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")","[leaves DogPoo, reaches Cartman, and starts raping him from behind] Smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh."
219,14,9,Eric Cartman,"No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!"
220,14,9,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?"
221,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, God. [gets a grabs his head and stumbles away, then falls on all fours] Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!"
222,14,9,Stan Marsh,[flatly] Why? [Kyle continues writhing and throws his hat away]
223,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Agggh! Agggh! [pulls out a tube of gel and puts some on his left hand] No! [quickly greases up his hair, takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves, puts on a necklace, combs his hair, puts on rings on his left hand, and writes ""KYLeY-B"" on his T-shirt]"
224,14,9,Stan Marsh,Dude.
225,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Snooki; in Jersey accent] Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!"
226,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")","Snooki just, uh, smoosh in the... the tenth..."
227,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage! [Snooki babbles and says her name] You've got cabbage in your muff! [Snooki continues babbling] You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! [Snooki continues babbling and Kyle finally fells her with a left hook. Snooki cries and escapes through a window. Cartman sobs a bit and puts his pants up]
228,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[Sniffling] Thank you, Kyle."
229,14,9,Jimbo Kern,That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
230,14,9,Randy Marsh,Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
231,14,9,Stuart McCormick,What's the point? Can't you see it's over? [the sound of roaring jets is heard and grows louder]
232,14,9,Jimbo Kern,Who is that?! [thirteen planes appear over the horizon]
233,14,9,Randy Marsh,"It's Al Qaeda! [cheers go up from the crowd. An Al Qaeda pilot salutes from his cockpit. Soon they're diving their planes into the Jersey crowd and killing the Jersey folk] Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! [More cheers go up from the crowd]"
234,14,9,Randy Marsh,"On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, ""Go away!"" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. [bin Laden is shown seated on a chair. Cheers go up and Randy places a garland on him, and kisses him on the cheek]"
235,14,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal."
236,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel."
237,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster. [Pinches Kyle's cheek] But you're my little monster."
238,14,9,Stan Marsh,"I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage?"
239,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing."
240,14,9,Randy Marsh,"On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. [a paratrooper descends from the rafters and quickly kills bin Laden with one shot]"
241,14,9,Paratrooper,"[to his pilot] Tango is down, tango is down."
242,14,9,Randy Marsh,We got him!
