0,20,9,Harrison Yates,"Everyone calm down, please. We have to have civil order. Listen to me."
1,20,9,,[crowd stops chattering]
2,20,9,Unknown person,Really?
3,20,9,Harrison Yates,"Now I know everyone's scared, but we have to keep control. Yes all of our emails and Internet histories are about to become public knowledge."
4,20,9,,[crowd chatters]
5,20,9,Harrison Yates,"[raises his arms] But, but,"
6,20,9,,[crowd stops]
7,20,9,Harrison Yates,"we all need to understand that TrollTrace will never happen if people don't log on to use it. The website is a massive database that cross-references everything ever said on the Internet. It relies on people typing in a name and address of someone else [lays arms on stand] to add to that database. If we could all agree to resist the urge to look up other people's Internet histories, [looks at Maggie] Maggie, okay? As long as we all respect each other's privacy, darling, [looks straight ahead] then our town won't suffer the same fate as Fort Collins."
8,20,9,Stephen Stotch,"And what are the police gonna do to make sure people don't use it?! I know I'll certainly respect others' privacy, but about other people like [points at Laura] Laura Tucker the Blabbermouth?"
9,20,9,Laura Tucker,Excuse me?
10,20,9,Harrison Yates,"And that's why we have to come together as a community, and resist any temptation to use TrollTrace, [looks at Maggie] Maggie. We have to stay in control. [looks in front of him] This hack of our city will never happen, so long as we rely on the rationality and the basic decency of the American people."
11,20,9,,[crowd panics and runs away]
12,20,9,Harrison Yates,Guess I could've worded that differently.
13,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[yells] What were you thinking?! How dare you outright defy me like that! Your brother was being punished for using the computer and you decide to just leave with him?
14,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I just felt bad for him, ma."
15,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"You felt bad for him, after all the horrible things he said to people online?! Your brother is a sick troll, Kyle! You just wait until your father gets home! [leaves the room and closes the door]"
16,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Ike, where the fuck have you been?! Daddy needs your help. You don't want Mommy and Daddy to get divorced, do you? [paces] You know how bad your mom is, she completely overreacts to everything. That's where your brother gets it from. You don't want to be like Kyle, do you?"
17,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,[goes in front of the computer] Hi dad.
18,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[gets shocked] Hey, buddy! Everything good there?"
19,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It was you, this whole time. You're the troll that caused all of this trouble."
20,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"No, it was your brother. I don't know what's wrong with him, Kyle. He needs counseling..."
21,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Heidi Turner did an emoji analysis. It was an adult. It was you.
22,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[starts talking right before Kyle finished] Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Okay, keep your voice down."
23,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,[talks softly] Why dad? Why did you do this?
24,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Because it's fucking funny, Kyle. It's called having a sense of humor, and laughing. You should fucking try it once in a while!"
25,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Putting a penis in the mouth of a mom who has cancer is funny?!
26,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Because it's so not funny, God! Pushing people's buttons to get a reaction can actually be very good for society, Kyle. Listen to me, the Danish are fucking crazy. You have to get people to stop them."
27,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,How?!
28,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Go get people riled up. Call the President. I don't know. When you push people's buttons, they go and push other people's buttons. Now get out there and... [ends call]"
29,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[enters Ike's room and yells] Kyle, Ike! What the hell is this?! What did I say?! Get off of that computer riiight nooooow!"
30,20,9,Ike Broflovski,[puts his head down]
31,20,9,Secretary,"Uh everyone, please listen! We don't have any rockets going to Mars! Yo-you're not listening! We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet. We're working as hard as we can. There's a little girl working on the people right now and apparently she's incredibly smart and funny."
32,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe?"
33,20,9,Heidi Turner,"[grabs mug] Babe, I have no idea what any of this means."
34,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it."
35,20,9,Heidi Turner,"Girls rule, women are funny, get over it."
36,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back."
37,20,9,Heidi Turner,[sighs]
38,20,9,Elon Musk,"Uh excuse me. Sorry, can we have a word please?"
39,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk]"
40,20,9,Elon Musk,This doesn't seem like it's gonna work out and we're rather busy.
41,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth."
42,20,9,Elon Musk,I haven't really heard her say anything funny.
43,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself."
44,20,9,Butters Stotch,"[sits on chair, watching the conversation] He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot."
45,20,9,Eric Cartman,[faces Butters with a mad face]
46,20,9,Dick,Here they come.
47,20,9,,"[Dane 2 opens the door as Bedrager, Dane 1, Dane 4, and him enter. The trolls stand up]"
48,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh thank god. There's been a mistake, okay?! I'm not one of [points at the other trolls] them. My son is Skankhunt42. Go online and see, he's still doing it!"
49,20,9,Dane 2,[points a gun at the trolls]
50,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"All of you, remove your clothes."
51,20,9,Anonymous821,What are you gonna do with us?
52,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,Remove your clothes now!
53,20,9,,[the trolls strip themselves naked]
54,20,9,Dane 2,"[enters] In here, move."
55,20,9,,"[trolls enter the room in a line where they are put on separate chairs, handcuffed]"
56,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[gets frieghtened] Oh god! Oh god, they're gonna [gets kicked by Dane 5] kill us! No no, wait! Okay okay, it was me! You're right, I'm Skankhunt! But I am not like them. Please, [gets put on a chair] I have a good job! I'm a good guy! [gets handcuffed] I'm sorry! [sighs heavily] I was just being funny! I was trying to make people laugh! [sees the Danes leaving the room] That's a positive thing, right?! I wasn't doing it to hurt people, I was just doing comedy. It's different! Please, it's different!"
57,20,9,,[the door closes]
58,20,9,Father Maxi,"Lord, we look to thee on this to our most trouble hour. We have been let astray and now all we could do is wait for the inevitable to happen. Soon everything we have said and done online is going to be known to all. Many lives will be turned upside down. Of course, I have nothing to worry about; since I'm a priest, there's nothing I'm ashamed of doing on the Internet, so [turns a page] definitely no reason to look up my history. But uh for many, this is a time to pray."
59,20,9,Everyone,"[speak in unison] O'Lord, please forgive for things we might have done online."
60,20,9,Harrison Yates,Maggie.
61,20,9,Men,"Please try to understand that even some of us who were on MatchingMavis.com, it was only out of curiosity, and not because we actually having an affair. Please understand that we might have used racial slurs, but only because it was to a close friend and never meant to be public."
62,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters with Ike] What are you all doing?! [walks closer to the priest] Somebody's threatening your way of life and you all are just sitting here praying, like uh a bunch of babies?"
63,20,9,Ike Broflovski,[follows Kyle] Like a bunch of pussies!
64,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, this isn't South Park! What's happened to us?! We used to have a challenge and deal with it, then move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling and Internet stuff over and over, week after week; and I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of it."
65,20,9,Randy Marsh,Yeah.
66,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,[stands on a step near Maxi] Now for once let's take a stand and try to end this. We can't let Denmark change who we are.
67,20,9,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, fuck Denmark."
68,20,9,Prayers,[speak after one another] Yeah!
69,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys need to, you know, call the President and get him to take action."
70,20,9,Prayers,[speak in disappointment] Aw!
71,20,9,Stephen Stotch,The President? He won't listen to us. He hates us now.
72,20,9,Randy Marsh,"No, [stands up] but there is somebody he will still listen to."
73,20,9,First General,"Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization blinked we've never seen. Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked."
74,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Well what do they want me to do about it?
75,20,9,Second General,You're the leader of the free world.  Everyone's looking to you to be the call and steady voice they all need.
76,20,9,Army Soldier,"[salutes] Mr. President? Mr. President, the Isreali prime minister is on Line 1, the chancellor of Germany is on Line 2, and a Mr. Slave is on Line 3."
77,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Mr. Slave? [picks up the phone on Line 3] This is the President.
78,20,9,Mr Slave,"[talks at his house while looking at his fingernails] Hey, what's up?"
79,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Well well well, crawling outta the woodwork to try and get me back now that I am a big cheese?"
80,20,9,Mr Slave,"No, I'm calling because people want you to bomb Denmark."
81,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Who wants me to bomb Denmark?
82,20,9,Mr Slave,Lots of people 'cause it's like gonna ruin their freedom of speech or something.
83,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Slave, this is all very complicated, diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't just go bombing other countries."
84,20,9,Mr Slave,"Oh Jesus Christ, you're such a little bitch."
85,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh I'm a bitch, huh? I happen to be President, bitch!"
86,20,9,Mr Slave,"You're a little bitch, President. You're too scared to bomb anybody."
87,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"I'm not scared, my advisors have told me that I..."
88,20,9,Mr Slave,"Yeah, you're scared, just do what your little advisors tell you to do."
89,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"If I decide a military strike on Denmark is warranted, then I will..."
90,20,9,Mr Slave,"You don't have the balls to bomb them, pussy."
91,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Pussy ass bitch.
92,20,9,Mr Slave,"Pussy ass bitch, fuck you."
93,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh [rambles] okay! You think so, huh?! Well watch this you gay asshole! [yells at the generals] Bomb Denmark!"
94,20,9,First General,Sir?
95,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"[turns around] The TrollTrace building or the whole fucking thing! Whatever it is, get the missiles ready!"
96,20,9,Mr Slave,"[talks to others in his house] Yeah, it worked."
97,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Alright!
98,20,9,,[everyone else cheered]
99,20,9,Butters Stotch,[talks to woman employee walking by] Hello. [enters the bathroom]
100,20,9,Eric Cartman,[enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing?
101,20,9,Butters Stotch,[talks to Cartman] Going pee!
102,20,9,Eric Cartman,"I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!"
103,20,9,Butters Stotch,Because you keep on telling everyone she is.
104,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Butters, Heidi is everything to me.  If you take her, I swear to god..."
105,20,9,Butters Stotch,"Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends! [walks closer to the toilets] I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart."
106,20,9,Eric Cartman,What are you talking about?
107,20,9,Butters Stotch,"That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop."
108,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny."
109,20,9,Butters Stotch,"Sure buddy, sure."
110,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Officials have stated that all communication with Denmark has end, and that a military strike on the country is now imminent."
111,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Yay!
112,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,The President stated that since then...
113,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[enters the room] Are you serious right now?!
114,20,9,Kyle Ike,Augh! [get off the chair]
115,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[yells] Get off that computerrrr!
116,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ma, we were just using it to look at the news."
117,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"I don't care, I said no computers! You kids are addicted to the Internet! You're sick, and you're addicted! It's changed your brother, and now it's turning you against me, Kyle!"
118,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm not against you, mom."
119,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"You are! Your father goes away on business and all you do is defy me at every turn! The next time you defy me, it will be your last! Do you understand?!"
120,20,9,Kyle Ike,"Yes, mom."
121,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"And when your father is home from Denmark, you two are both going in for counseling."
122,20,9,Kyle Ike,[in complete shock] Denmark?
123,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,What is dad doing in Denmark?!
124,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"The government sent him over to do paralegal training, so it would've nice if you could've shown a little support! [leaves the room and shuts the door]"
125,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Ohhh shit.
126,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,[whimpering]Oh God! [continues whimpering]
127,20,9,Anonymous821,Will somebody shut him up?
128,20,9,Dick,"Skank. Skank, get ahold of yourself"
129,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"You were right, Dildo, when you said I was a dick, when you called me an asshole. I am. And now I'm going to die alone, just like you said (starts crying again)"
130,20,9,Dick,Come on. You're not an asshole
131,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[sobbing] You said I was, though, 'cause I only trolled to be...funny."
132,20,9,Dick,"Well--Well, maybe being funny is just sort of how you deal with serious subjects."
133,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[sobbing] Really? You don't think I'm a bad person? I'm sorry. All you guys, I'm sorry"
134,20,9,Trolls,"That's okay. Okay, Skank. All right"
135,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,[calling out to TrollTrace staff] Excuse me. Hello?
136,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Could I please speak to the person in charge? [Bedrager hears Gerald and walks over to the monitor] I have something to say. [security camera zooms in on Gerald] Please, just for a moment?"
137,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,[stares intently at the monitor with the other employees] Bring him to the conference room
138,20,9,Heidi Turner,"[sighs], Dude, I am so not getting this."
139,20,9,Eric Cartman,[walks away in shock]
140,20,9,Eric Cartman,[walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.
141,20,9,Butters Stotch,"Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us."
142,20,9,Eric Cartman,[Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?
143,20,9,Butters Stotch,"The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars."
144,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!"
145,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for talking to me. I just really needed to get something off my chest. I'm so sorry. I had the biggest epiphany about the damage I've done, the people I've hurt, but the fact of the matter is I'm not really a troll. [Bedrager continues eating and not paying attention to Gerald.] I actually have a job. I'm a lawyer. I've got a loving wife and great kids. Uhm, I've got a family that really misses me and needs me."
146,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[continues eating and not looking at Gerald] Freja Ollegard, the volleyball player, had a family, too. They miss her quite a lot too."
147,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"And that--that is so tragic. And I'm so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling. It's--It's wrong. But, you know, I just sort of set things in motion. See, I'm a satirist. I challenge people's point of views by being sort of edgy. [Bedrager stops and hears Gerald out] And sometimes, people can be like ""Whoa!"" and mistake that for hate, but its not hate. Its pointing out hypocrisies in out society."
148,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,You're so full of skinkinslat I can smell it from here.
149,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"If you say mean things and you're mean, then I agree, you should be killed. But if you're being funny, which spreads joy --"
150,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,You really think my plan is to kill you?
151,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,It's not?
152,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[To the two Danes standing guard] Leave us. [shoos them away with his hand] Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
153,20,9,,[The two Danes walk out of the room.]
154,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,[In a sinister tone] Do you want to know what's really funny?
155,20,9,First General,"Mr. President, the bombers are en route to Europe."
156,20,9,Second General,Are you sure you want to proceed with this?
157,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"[Licking his ice cream spoon]Yeah, yeah. Bomb the shit out of them. We have to be tough here."
158,20,9,Army Soldier,"Mr. President? Mr. President, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg is on Line 1, the Chairman of the Worker's Party is on Line 2, and Kyle is on Line 3."
159,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Oh geez. What does Kyle want.
160,20,9,,[Walks over to red phone and picks up the receiver]
161,20,9,Mr. Garrison,This is the President
162,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[in his bedroom, with Ike] Mr. Garrison, you can't bomb Denmark!"
163,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Kyle."
164,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's--It's wrong and it could start a bigger war.
165,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle, this is all very serious diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't understand the political complexities involved here."
166,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,[Looks at phone in shock and then thinks of an answer] I understand that you're a dipshit little gay puppet.
167,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Excuse me?
168,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.
169,20,9,Mr. Garrison,Who told you that?
170,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Everyone knows that. You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into doing.
171,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle, I am the President."
172,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're a little dipshit president.
173,20,9,Ike Broflovski,With a dirty...asshole.
174,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,With a dirty asshole.
175,20,9,Ike Broflovski,And...you shit out your dick.
176,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,And you shit out your dick. [covers phone with hand and looks at Ike] Where did you learn to talk like this?
177,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Daddy!
178,20,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh that's what people think, huh? Well, maybe I won't bomb Denmark. What do you think about that?"
179,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you will, because you're a little retarded shit bitch."
180,20,9,Mr. Garrison,[Yelling] God fucking damn it [slams receiver] Hold up! Hold up on the fucking bombs a minute!
181,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?"
182,20,9,Heidi Turner,"[Stares intently at white board, not paying attention to Cartman] I don't understand what any of these symbols mean, so in my head I'm trying to replace them with something I know to try and see patterns."
183,20,9,Eric Cartman,"[Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?"
184,20,9,Heidi Turner,"And when I do that, I can see how everything lines up except for one thing."
185,20,9,,"[As Heidi continues staring at the board, the formulas start changing into random emojis]"
186,20,9,Heidi Turner,"[Thinking] I call it [echo] ""Emoji Analysis"" [the formulas keeping changing into emojis as the echo continues]."
187,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like ""Could you--Could you hand me my water,"" or something. I can't--I can't remember."
188,20,9,Heidi Turner,"These two don't line up, babe. The only things that are out of order."
189,20,9,Eric Cartman,Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?
190,20,9,Heidi Turner,[Turns to Elon Musk and his staff] Excuse me. Is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence?
191,20,9,,[the Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker review his clipboard notes]
192,20,9,SpaceX Employee,I'm sorry?
193,20,9,Heidi Turner,That stuff there. Its in the wrong place. It needs to come before that.
194,20,9,,[the employees review their notes again]
195,20,9,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,[Looks at his laptop] Wait a minute. She might be on to something here
196,20,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, now could you just do the ""my vagina"" thing for them? Could you just say ""my vagina""?"
197,20,9,Heidi Turner,[Turns around and runs towards Elon Musk] They're out of sequence! I'll show you! [Cartman looks on in shock as she leaves]
198,20,9,Eric Cartman,What the fuck is happening?
199,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[picks up an empty glass] Do you remember, Mr. a-Skankhunt, when you and your little buddies trolled the entire country of a-Denmark?"
200,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"And that was wrong, too. I certainly want to apologize for that."
201,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[pours himself a glass of wine] That was certainly a display of the power of a-trolling, wasn't it.[turns around to face Gerald] But, what would be even more impressive?"
202,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,I-I don't understand.
203,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"What if you could troll the entire world? Somebody who could rise to political power through nothing more that pushing people's a-buttons and getting them all riled up, become the leader of...a Scandinavian country, perhaps, get them to listen to you when, actually...[speaks with an American accent] you're not even fucking Danish."
204,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,No way.
205,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,Use that country to create a machine that relies on the shittiness of people to fuck over other people and watch the whole world go completely batshit.
206,20,9,,[Bedrager walks over to a microphone and starts talking over the P.A. system]
207,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,[speaking with a Danish accent] Attention all a-TrollTrace workers. Please report to assembly hall one for a big announcement. [speaking with an American accent] Completely fool everyone [sits at table with Gerald] and keep your real intentions completely anonymous.
208,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,"You would--deliberately start World War III, let the people of Denmark die, set everyone on Earth against each other? Why?!"
209,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"Because its freakin' hilarious! Getting a Scandinavian country to fight trolls by building a giant machine that actually shows everyone on Earth is kind of a troll, too?"
210,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,That's not funny.
211,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"That's not funny?! Don't be a fag, dude! That's real bro shit there. Sorry to step on your fucking dicks in the mouth and tit jokes, you amateur little pussy. Come on! Have some fucking balls!"
212,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,You can't do this to people! It's not right!
213,20,9,Lennart Bedrager,"[chuckles] Listen to you. [picks up microphone from under the table and starts talking in a Danish accent again] All right, everyone. Show's about to begin. [clicks on remote]"
214,20,9,,"[Two Danes try to access a door with their access card, but are denied access and try manually opening the door with a crank handle. The wall panels slide back and show the remaining trolls in the Observatory room, who can also see the TrollTrace employees.]"
215,20,9,Dick,What the fuck is going on?!
216,20,9,,"[The trolls and TrollTrace employees look at each other, before an overhead project starts up and a countdown begins on the panels. The music video for ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" then starts up]"
217,20,9,Music video,Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you.
218,20,9,TrollTrace Employee,Uh-oh.
219,20,9,,"[""Never Gonna Give You Up"" continues playing in the background]"
220,20,9,Dick,Wow. That's pretty impressive.
221,20,9,Gerald Broflovski,Waaiitt!!!
222,20,9,,"[Bedrager smiles as the doors shut and he slides his access card to lock the doors, trapping Gerald inside. He tries to break the glass doors open as Bedrager happily walks away.]"
223,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[standing in the hallway] Ike...It's time. [walks up to Ike] I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this, but its the only way now."
224,20,9,Ike Broflovski,I know.
225,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Just remember--I always loved you, little brother."
226,20,9,Ike Broflovski,"I love you too, big brother."
227,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,Let's...just get this over with.
228,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Mommy?
229,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,Yes?
230,20,9,Ike Broflovski,Suck my balls. You're a fat bitch. [runs off]
231,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[angrily] Whhaaatt! [tosses book aside and jumps out of bed] You get back here, you little monster!"
232,20,9,,[Ike hops down the staircase and runs into the kitchen with Sheila behind him]
233,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[yelling] I have had it with you! Don't you run away from me, Ike! Who do you think you are?! [runs into the kitchen and sees Kyle standing there] Where is he?! Where is your brother?!"
234,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,He's in the pantry.
235,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[yelling] Don't you try and hide from me now! You are in big trouble now, Ike! [She continues on into the pantry before Kyle shuts the door on her and puts a chair against it] Whaaatt!  What, what! Kyle, you open this door right now. [starts to pound her fist on pantry door]"
236,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ma. Mom, we are really sorry..."
237,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[yelling] Open this door! [continues pounding on the door]
238,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,But Ike and I have to do something and we have to be able to use the computers
239,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[yelling] What,what?! No computers! Do not touch the computers! [continues pounding on the door]"
240,20,9,Kyle Broflovski,"We have to do this, Mom. Its the only thing that can save our family now."
241,20,9,Sheila Broflovski,[continues pounding on the door] You are done! You hear me?! You are both done! [screams]
