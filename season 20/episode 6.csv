0,20,6,Eric Cartman,[jumps] Whee! [waves at someone far away] Hi! [looks at a human city] So cool! [leaps towards the city]
1,20,6,Unnamed characters 1 and 2,[wave at Cartman] Hi!
2,20,6,Unnamed character 3,[waves at Cartman] Hi!
3,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Hi! [stops and sees a roller coaster] Dude, Mars rules. [leaps to the roller coaster] Mars rules!"
4,20,6,Heidi Turner,"What are you thinking about, Babe?"
5,20,6,Eric Cartman,Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.
6,20,6,Heidi Turner,"You're worried about him again, aren't you? Your friend, Kyle?"
7,20,6,Eric Cartman,"[sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi."
8,20,6,Heidi Turner,Then talk to him babe. Tell him what we're doing. Maybe you can get him back.
9,20,6,Eric Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Heidi."
10,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[repeatedly clicks on keyboard and talks softly] Ha ha, yeah. I'm yours, bitch. Ha ha. [speaks louder]. Suck it! [moves the mouse] How about a dick in your mouth?! There you go! Ha ha, ha ha ha ha. [notices the door bell ringing] Aw! [walks to the front door, and opens it]"
11,20,6,Trolls,Hi Skankhunt!
12,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,[gets shocked] Ah! [tries looking behind him] What are you guys doing here?!
13,20,6,Dick,We came to celebrate!
14,20,6,PurpleheadedQueeflicker,Not everyday you troll a whole country.
15,20,6,Anonymous821,[showed a case of John Adams beer] We brought some beer. Let's have a trolling party.
16,20,6,PurpleheadedQueeflicker,We did it!
17,20,6,Dick,"I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world."
18,20,6,Trolls,Yeah! Yeah!
19,20,6,Troll 7,You said it!
20,20,6,SupersexyLisa18,Thanks to us!
21,20,6,Dick,"And I think on the next one, [raises his beer] we're only gonna get better."
22,20,6,Troll 4,No doubt about it.
23,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Wh-what are you talking about ""next one""?"
24,20,6,Dick,"Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world?"
25,20,6,Anonymous821,We're like super-trolls who could change anything.
26,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,[leans to Dick] Can I talk to you for a second?
27,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,Why did you bring them here?!
28,20,6,Dick,"What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt."
29,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are!
30,20,6,Dick,But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election.
31,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political!
32,20,6,Dick,Of course it's political!
33,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?!"
34,20,6,Dick,I remember being called a fag for no reason.
35,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go."
36,20,6,Dick,"Okay. [puts down his beer mug] Sure, Skankhunt. Whatever you say. [walks away]"
37,20,6,Garrison,Presidential election is only two weeks away. We have to [lifts a bag of memberberries talking] destroy these things.
38,20,6,Jar Berries,'Member the Bi-wing fighters? 'Member the Service Droids? I 'member.
39,20,6,Randy Marsh,[setting up experiment] That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried.
40,20,6,Experiment Berry,"'Member, 'member Mos Eisley? 'Member the Rancor, 'member? 'Member sand people? 'Member the Cantina? 'Member-- [gets torched by Randy and screams] My eyes!"
41,20,6,Jar Berries,"What's going on now? They're using a torch on him. Oh, are they gonna use a torch on us?!"
42,20,6,Experiment Berry,"Ah, Aaaaah! [stops getting torched] 'Member Bespin? 'Member Wedge? I loved Wedge. 'Member?"
43,20,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh, there has to be something."
44,20,6,Garrison,Try the acid.
45,20,6,Experiment Berry,'Member Mon Mothma? 'Member the rebel transports? [screams while acid is poured on him]
46,20,6,Jar Berries,"They're trying to destroy us. They are?! Our whole species?! They can't do that?! Yeah they can! 'Member the Death Star blowing up Alderaan? Oo, Alderaan, I 'member."
47,20,6,Experiment Berry,"[keeps on screaming until Randy runs out of acid] 'Member the Cloud City? 'Member IG-88, the bounty hunter droid? 'member, that was fanta'tic."
48,20,6,Randy Marsh,Damn it! [takes off flashlight] These things are impossible to get rid of.
49,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,[tilts head up] Yeah.
50,20,6,Eric Cartman,"[opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute?"
51,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, what do you want now?!"
52,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Just a second. Please, Kyle?"
53,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hurry up!
54,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby."
55,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah! Dude, what the fuck?"
56,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom."
57,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,I'm going to the bathroom!
58,20,6,Heidi Turner,"Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset."
59,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
60,20,6,Eric Cartman,"[walks away from the toilet] I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle?"
61,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks down] I have to stay with my group, Cartman."
62,20,6,Eric Cartman,"[walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think."
63,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little-- [sees FaceTime call from Dick] Ah. Oh no, not again! [accepts his call] Yes?"
64,20,6,Dick,"Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins."
65,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting.
66,20,6,Dick,"Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy."
67,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed.
68,20,6,Dick,"[sighs] Oh, alright. Look, [grabs his guitar] I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?"
69,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,No!
70,20,6,Dick,[sings badly while strumming his guitar] Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie  flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the--
71,20,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[ends the call] Bye! Jesus, what is wrong with people?! [drinks wine] Huh. [keeps typing] Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank."
72,20,6,Heidi Turner,"[To Kyle.] This is gonna seem a little weird to you, okay?"
73,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,What is?
74,20,6,Heidi Turner,"Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was."
75,20,6,Eric Cartman,"Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it."
76,20,6,Heidi Turner,"Before I stopped searching, I learned something. [opens her door] Take a look."
77,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,What is all this?
78,20,6,Heidi Turner,"To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it ""emoji analysis"". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away."
79,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that's pretty smart."
80,20,6,Eric Cartman,"She's funny too, Kyle."
81,20,6,Heidi Turner,"After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult."
82,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,You mean like one of the teachers?
83,20,6,Heidi Turner,I think... it's one of the parents.
84,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,Are you sure?
85,20,6,Heidi Turner,"I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match."
86,20,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Emoji analysis, it's genius!"
87,20,6,Eric Cartman,You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.
