0,20,10,General Revaur,"Mr. President? Russians are scrambling bombers to attack Denmark. NATO wants to know how we intend to stop them. Mr. President?...Mr. President you can't just sit there with your ""stank face""."
1,20,10,Mr Garrison,Iah-uhk-uh-I cain't?
2,20,10,Military Officer,"The TrollTrace website is set to go online in less than fifteen minutes, the world is in complete chaos!"
3,20,10,NSA Agent,"[From a nearby workstation.] Sir, someone is leading a coordinated cyber strike on the TrollTrace website."
4,20,10,Mr Garrison,"[Joyously.] A cyber attack, well that's good! Where's it comin' from?"
5,20,10,NSA Agent,"It could be Russian, we don't know. Whoever this troll is, he's pretty fucking hardcore sir."
6,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, okay, Token? Token are you there?"
7,20,10,Token Black,"I'm here, what's this about Kyle?"
8,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't tell you dude, I just need your
Smokin'


help...Please, my life depends
Smokin'

 on it."
9,20,10,Token Black,"Okay, okay sure.
I feel alright, mamma..."
10,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, 
I'm not jokin', yeah

 I need you to tell me the worst thing I can say on the United Negro College Fund website to piss off black people."
11,20,10,Token Black,What!?
12,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Token, please! There's no time to explain!"
13,20,10,Token Black,Beyonce ain't nothin' but a Taylor Swift ripoff.
14,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,That helps thank you.
15,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Tweek, Craig, I need you to get on the GLAAD website and respond to all the horrible shit I just said about gay people."
16,20,10,Craig Tucker,Why'd you say horrible shit about gay people?
17,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not important, just get on it and respond."
18,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[To Tweek & Craig.] Hang on. [To Stan.] Stan! Finally. Dude I need everybody online now!
19,20,10,Stan Marsh,For what?
20,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, there's no time to explain, you gotta go out and get everybody, tell them to get on their computers, go!"
21,20,10,Stan Marsh,[Pumped up] Okay!
22,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, what's the worst possible thing you could say on a website for handicapped Syrian refugees?"
23,20,10,Jimmy Valmer,Wuh-Wuh-Waddle back to Syria you desert-tard. [Jimmy smiles gleefully]
24,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,You boys...better not be on that computaaaaaaah! I'll make you pay for this. You locked your mother in the pantry? I'll lock you in your rooms forevaaah.
25,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,Skank
26,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,Dildo?
27,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skankhunt, can you hear me?"
28,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yes! Yes, where are you?"
29,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers.
30,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,How long before the website goes online?
31,20,10,Danish Worker,Less than ten mienutes.
32,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,Oh God!
33,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate."
34,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Skank, whoever's doing it is doing it from your account."
35,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,My account?
36,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people."
37,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,[Proudly.] That's my boy!
38,20,10,Female SpaceX Worker,"The core energy is completely stable, and very easy to reduce. It's the most massive energy source of its size we've ever seen."
39,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"We've done it Elon, with this type of energy we can easily get mankind to Mars."
40,20,10,Elon Musk,"This is amazing! And it's all thanks to you little girl, how did you get to be so smart?"
41,20,10,Heidi Turner,I just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me.
42,20,10,Elon Musk,"Well, c'mon, I wanna know everything about you."
43,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them."
44,20,10,Butters Stotch,Yep.
45,20,10,Eric Cartman,"We have to tell someone the truth, Butters."
46,20,10,Butters Stotch,Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars.
47,20,10,Eric Cartman,"It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before."
48,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Hey, you guys need anything? Water, Soda?"
49,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?"
50,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Sure, about what?"
51,20,10,Eric Cartman,The end of our species.
52,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, who else we got now, Kevin are you there, Kenny?"
53,20,10,Kevin Stoley,"Ye-I, I typed in everything you told me to."
54,20,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Me too dude, what's next?)"
55,20,10,Ike Broflovski,"Kyle, I wanna help tooo."
56,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say."
57,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins.
58,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Who are you?
59,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you."
60,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,O-- Okay?
61,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too."
62,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell is ""Trevor's Axiom""?"
63,20,10,NSA Agent,Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling.
64,20,10,NSA Agent,"It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C."
65,20,10,NSA Agent,"Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity."
66,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected."
67,20,10,NSA Agent,"Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers..."
68,20,10,General Revaur,[Interrupting] It could blow up the Internet before TrollTrace ever does substantial damage.
69,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll."
70,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars."
71,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"You keep saying that, but not why."
72,20,10,Butters Stotch,Because Eric knows the future.
73,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,What are you talking about?
74,20,10,Eric Cartman,"I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her."
75,20,10,Eric Cartman,But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.
76,20,10,Cartman Voiceover,"At first, you'll be super-happy, bouncing around the red sand."
77,20,10,Eric Cartman,Everyone will be really nice.
78,20,10,Female 1,Hi!
79,20,10,Female 2,Hi!
80,20,10,Eric Cartman,Hi!
81,20,10,Eric Cartman,You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.
82,20,10,Eric Cartman,"But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women."
83,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Hmm, let's see"
84,20,10,Eric Cartman,"And then you'll start to wonder, ""Where are all the other guys?"""
85,20,10,Butters Stotch,[Whispering] Look underground.
86,20,10,Eric Cartman,"And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for."
87,20,10,Eric Cartman,What is this place?
88,20,10,Eric Cartman,And that's when you'll learn the truth...
89,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women."
90,20,10,Eric Cartman,"They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes."
91,20,10,Eric Cartman,"What?! No, no!"
92,20,10,Eric Cartman,You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!
93,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Nooooooo! No, no!"
94,20,10,Female 3,Write jokes!
95,20,10,Eric Cartman,No! No!
96,20,10,Eric Cartman,"And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars."
97,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"That's, That's ridiculous. Why would women need us to do that? They're just as funny as men."
98,20,10,Eric Cartman,"If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on."
99,20,10,Female SpaceX Employee,What?
100,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,What?
101,20,10,Eric Cartman,You have to help us stop this!
102,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,[Frustrated.] Ah! God damn it!
103,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,Skank! You still there?
104,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"[He walks over to the TV.] Yeah, I'm here."
105,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers."
106,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,[He looks up at the monito.r] I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room.
107,20,10,TrollTrace employee,"Oh, the key code to the conference room is 9..."
108,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,[He runs over to the panel and presses 9.] Yeah...?
109,20,10,TrollTrace employee,That's it. 9.
110,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"[Frustrated.] Oh, for fuck's sake! [The panel light turns green, the door opens, and Gerald runs out.]"
111,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[She's pounding the door.] Kyle! You better run if I get out of here! You better pray that--[The chair moves and she is begins to pry open the door with her hands.]-ah!
112,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank. Skankhunt, are you there yet?"
113,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I'm up with all the servers."
114,20,10,TrollTrace employee,The first breaker should be there. Tell him to look for a large red lever.
115,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, do you see a large red lever?"
116,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"[notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever]"
117,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,[He speaks over P.A. system.] Flip it off
118,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,[He speaks over P.A. system.] That's good. Keep going Skankhunt.
119,20,10,Ike Broflovski,You are all dumbass fuckwads.
120,20,10,Ike Broflovski,"Lick my asshole, you Mexican bitch."
121,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Ike!
122,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Aah!
123,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Yelling.] You dare lock me in the pantry, so you can play on your computer?!"
124,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Mommy!
125,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[Yelling.] You're gonna pay for what you've done!
126,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Aah! [He runs out into the hallway.]
127,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Kyle!
128,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Ike!
129,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[He throws down headset.] Shit!
130,20,10,Ike Broflovski,Mommy got out!
131,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[Panting.] You...! You helped turned your brother this way!
132,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help--"
133,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!
134,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent"
135,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[Yelling.] Do you think I'm stupid?!
136,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Mom. You just don't know everything. [Kyle straps a vest around his chest.]"
137,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"You both march out of here, right now!"
138,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family"
139,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Look, Elon, I'm just saying before we go any further, you might want to hear this kid out. [They both stop in front of Cartman and Butters.]"
140,20,10,Male Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker,"Go on, tell Elon."
141,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground."
142,20,10,Elon Musk,For what?
143,20,10,Eric Cartman,What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.
144,20,10,Elon Musk,That's two things.
145,20,10,Eric Cartman,They're pretty related.
146,20,10,Elon Musk,Women don't need us for comedy. They can be just as funny as men. You should meet my girlfriend. She's really smart and really funny.
147,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon."
148,20,10,Butters Stotch,"I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it."
149,20,10,Eric Cartman,"It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon."
150,20,10,Eric Cartman,They can live without us. We can't live without them.
151,20,10,Eric Cartman,"If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon--[He turns around and notices that Elon isn't there.] Elon?"
152,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care."
153,20,10,Ike Broflovski,You fat hooker.
154,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out."
155,20,10,Ike Broflovski,You clean your fucking mouth out.
156,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now!"
157,20,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town."
158,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Shit!
159,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hold on...
160,20,10,Mr Garrison,Kyle?!
161,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[Surprised.] Oh, hey, Mr. President"
162,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?!"
163,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Uh...what do you mean?
164,20,10,Mr Garrison,Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you.
165,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Surprised.] It is?
166,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Keep up the good work. We're gonna take that big shitstorm of hate you're creating and amplify it. We'll try to create enough energy to blow up the whole fucking internet. [He gives Kyle a military salute] You're doing God's work, son. Keep it up."
167,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[He gives Mr. Garrison a half-hearted military salute.] Thanks?
168,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"Oh, no, you don't."
169,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me."
170,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,What? What? What?
171,20,10,Laura Tucker,[She wipes her nose with a tissue.] The son of a bitch. He's such a bastard.
172,20,10,Laura Tucker,When you marry someone and you think you know them...
173,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,I don't know what you're talking about.
174,20,10,Laura Tucker,TrollTrace. Its up and running. [She points to the laptop sitting on the table.]
175,20,10,Laura Tucker,It can tell you anybody's Internet history. [She starts to walk to her couch.]
176,20,10,Laura Tucker,I couldn't resist. I looked up my husband. [Sheila approaches the laptop.] The websites he's visited are just...disgusting!
177,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,May I use this a moment?
178,20,10,Laura Tucker,Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see.
179,20,10,Eric Cartman,"What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars."
180,20,10,Butters Stotch,"Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy."
181,20,10,Eric Cartman,"If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat."
182,20,10,Butters Stotch,What?!
183,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! Where the fuck are you?!
184,20,10,Butters Stotch,"Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you?"
185,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,SpaceX? Why?!
186,20,10,Butters Stotch,"Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it."
187,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,[He swivels his chair around.] Like...how ginormic of an energy source?
188,20,10,Butters Stotch,Like enough to get humanity to Mars.
189,20,10,Eric Cartman,[He is heard over Kyle's phone.] Is that Kyle?
190,20,10,Eric Cartman,"[He takes Butters' phone.] Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now."
191,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other."
192,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,"[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, there's no more time! Have you found the last breaker?"
193,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway.
194,20,10,TrollTrace employee,That last breaker should be there
195,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,Heading to it now!
196,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,I'm ten steps ahead of you!
197,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh?"
198,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong!
199,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to?
200,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,It's completely heartless and malicious!
201,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious?"
202,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical.
203,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,How is not satirical?
204,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,There's nothing here.
205,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Maybe Kyle was telling the truth. [She gets off of chair and walks towards Laura.]
206,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me.
207,20,10,Laura Tucker,About what?
208,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"I accused Ike of...of...well, I can't really say, but this thing says that he's clean. I got to find my boys, Laura. Thank you so much. [She approaches the front door.]"
209,20,10,Laura Tucker,Its not our kids we have to be worried about. [Sheila stops and turns to her.]
210,20,10,Laura Tucker,"My husband was on three ""married-but-dating"" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends?"
211,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy."
212,20,10,Laura Tucker,"Sure, yeah. Respect. Nice of you to give him that. [She walks toward the laptop.]"
213,20,10,Laura Tucker,"Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?"
214,20,10,NSA Agent,There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can.
215,20,10,Army General 2,"Mr. President, TrollTrace has been online for almost 15 minutes now. Its too late. We need to get you down to the bunker."
216,20,10,Mr Garrison,Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good.
217,20,10,Soldier,"[He holds the red telephone.] Mr. President, we have an urgent call from Kyle."
218,20,10,Mr Garrison,"[He picks up the phone.] Sorry, Kyle. Looks like its not going to work."
219,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[He types on his computer.] Mr. Garrison, I might have just found a lot more energy. Is there anyway the Pentagon can connect to SpaceX?"
220,20,10,Mr Garrison,SpaceX? What the fuck is that?
221,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[He types on his computer.] You know, the company trying to find new forms of energy, create jobs and get mankind to Mars."
222,20,10,Mr Garrison,"Okay, that's dumb, but go on."
223,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?"
224,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter.
225,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"No, but see, that's just nihilism."
226,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"Oh, come on!"
227,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,That is!
228,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,"So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous!"
229,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other.
230,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire.
231,20,10,Eric Cartman,Attention all SpaceX employees. [Elon Musk and his group turn away from the energy source chamber and look up.]
232,20,10,Eric Cartman,Please evacuate the building immediately. [A group of men working on Tesla cars stop and hear the announcement.]
233,20,10,Eric Cartman,We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. [Heidi walks over to Cartman from behind.]
234,20,10,Eric Cartman,"The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can. [He notices Heidi.] Ah! [He puts the microphone away.] Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up?"
235,20,10,Heidi Turner,There's a bomb threat?
236,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. [He grabs Heidi and runs with her to the energy source chamber before she stops him.]"
237,20,10,Heidi Turner,"Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately."
238,20,10,Eric Cartman,Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.
239,20,10,Heidi Turner,Did I do something wrong?
240,20,10,Eric Cartman,"[He grabs Heidi's hands.] No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? [He then turns her away, so she doesn't see what's going on with the chamber.]"
241,20,10,Heidi Turner,"You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh?"
242,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on."
243,20,10,Heidi Turner,"Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings."
244,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. [He puts his arm around her while looking back at the guys.]"
245,20,10,Eric Cartman,Now come on we got to get outside.
246,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,I shouldn't do this.
247,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true. [He turns around.]"
248,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people. [Bedrager looks down, agreeing with Gerald.]"
249,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have. [He slowly shuffles forward towards Bedrager.]"
250,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself. [He stops a few inches from Bedrager.] With only one minor difference."
251,20,10,Lennart Bedrager,Noooooo!!!
252,20,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!"
253,20,10,Dildo Shwaggins,That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!
254,20,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. President, do it!"
255,20,10,Mr Garrison,Reroute the internet through SpaceX!.
256,20,10,Pentagon Employee,Rerouting now!
257,20,10,Sheila Broflovski,[She stares at the black screen.] What the hell just happened?!
258,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?."
259,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?"
260,20,10,Heidi Turner,"Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh?"
261,20,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares."
262,20,10,Heidi Turner,"Well, what do you mean?"
263,20,10,Eric Cartman,It was a joke.
264,20,10,Kyle voiceover,"And so, life goes on."
265,20,10,Kyle voiceover,The end of civilization didn't happen.
266,20,10,Kyle voiceover,A massive electrical pulse completely erased the internet.
267,20,10,Kyle voiceover,We've been given a second chance.
268,20,10,Kyle voiceover,A mulligan.
269,20,10,Kyle voiceover,"Anything we might be ashamed of, gone forever."
270,20,10,Kyle voiceover,Maybe now boys and girls can learn to respect each other again.
271,20,10,Kyle voiceover,Realize how careful our online lives have to be.
272,20,10,Kyle voiceover,"Because we've all seen what happens when the Twitters, Facebook and trolls decide our reality."
273,20,10,Kyle voiceover,"Now that we've been given this second chance, it is up to all of us to see what we do with it."
274,20,10,News Anchor,"And the first new e-mail since the internet was erased was successfully went out at 6 a.m. today. The honor went to a Mr. Dave Beckett of Boca Raton, Florida."
275,20,10,News Reporter,"Mr. Beckett, you had the honor of being the first person to socialize on the new internet. Could you tell us what you did?"
276,20,10,Dave Beckett,"Well, I sent an e-mail with a photo to my old friend, Thomas Winger, up in Connecticut."
277,20,10,News Reporter,And what you did say to Mr. Winger?
278,20,10,Dave Beckett,"[He pauses.] I showed him my dick, called him a fag."
