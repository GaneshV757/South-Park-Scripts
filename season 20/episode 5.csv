4,20,5,Lola,Take him out!
5,20,5,Nelly,"I don't care if you're a boy, I'm gonna kick your ass!"
6,20,5,Butters Stotch,"[is seen with his pants put down and shirt pulled up] Anytime anywhere, skank."
7,20,5,Boys except Butters,Yeah!
8,20,5,Boys except Butters,Yeah!
9,20,5,Nelly,Pull up your stupid pants first.
10,20,5,Butters Stotch,Why? You're afraid to fight me like a man?
11,20,5,Clyde Donovan,"Kick her ass, Butters. She called you stupid."
12,20,5,Wendy Testaburger,He is stupid! Look at him!
13,20,5,Jimmy Valmer,At least he's not a zzzzitty-faced ggirl.
14,20,5,Boys expect Butters and Jimmy,Yeah!
15,20,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks from the girls side of the fight to the in between Nelly and Butters and spreads his arms] Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys! [crowd stops yelling] Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl?"
16,20,5,Annie Knitts,"Get out of here, Cartman; nobody's buying it."
17,20,5,Red,"Yeah, everyone knows you're the worst!"
18,20,5,Heidi Turner,"Hey, leave him alone! [walks from the boys side of the fight to near Cartman] Eric tries to help [spreads her arms] and you call him names?! [talks to Cartman] Sorry, babe, I had to step in."
19,20,5,Eric Cartman,"It's cool, Baby."
20,20,5,,[Heidi and Cartman kiss each other and causing the others to be flabbergasted]
21,20,5,Wendy Testaburger,Heidi?!
22,20,5,Annie Knitts,[faints]
23,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl."
24,20,5,Advisor 1,"All right sir [gives Garrison his lines], don't be nervous for your speech; I know we're down a bit in the polls, but there's still a great chance we can win the Swing States."
25,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"There's [flips through pages] still a chance, are you serious?!"
26,20,5,Publicist 1,"Just one thing sir, be a little careful of what you say about women. Uh, seems like that might be losing us some votes. [walks away]"
27,20,5,Herbert Garrison,[puts his hand under his chin] Oh you don't say?
28,20,5,Chris Christie,"Ladies and gentlemen, out country's divided like never before. And we all know that only one man has the guts to say what we're all thinking. Please, welcome the man who with your help will soon be the next President of the United States! [Mr. Garrison comes out to great fanfare and takes the mic.]"
29,20,5,Crowd Members,Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! [somewhere in there a man shrieks. Garrison lights up a cigarette and starts pacing]
30,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"So I'm standin' in line at the airport, waitin' in security 'cause of all the freakin' Muslims. [cheers and applause]"
31,20,5,Supporter,Ow!
32,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"And the TSA security people all look like black thugs from the inner city; I'm like ""Oh good, you're gonna protect us?"" [laughter] Well maybe it's good they're all gang members. At least they can tell the difference between Muslims and Mexicans, 'cause God knows I can't. [applause] You know, I'm standin' there in line and you know what I do? I stick my finger in this chick's asshole, [applause and laughter] and she turns to me and says, ""Hey, aren't you that guy that's running for President?"" I say Yeah. She says ""Why you got your finger in my ass?"" I say ""I'm just keeping it warm, honey, 'cause that chick next to you is way hotter and I'm gonna stick it in her clam."" [the men are clapping, the women just look at him now] Yeah, let's make America great again. No dude wants his finger in some ugly bitch's ass. [the men laugh] You gotta be careful though, it's only about half an inch away, you know, that asshole and that clam, so you gotta be careful. Right dudes? [A woman gets up and makes her way to the aisle] Oh. Oh, where are you goin'? Are you leavin? [the woman turns right to leave the rally] I'm sorry, did I offend you? Where did I lose you, honey? You've been okay with the ""fuck everyone to death,"" all the Muslim and Mexican shit, but fingers in the ass did it for ya? [she reaches the door and exits] Cool, just wanted to see where your line was! [some more women get up, one of them leaves with her husband] Oh yeah, look, I guess some more broads are leavin'. Oh Jeez you were so on board, I can't believe I let that little offensive mark slip. Poor girls. Did you get your feelings hurt after ""Fuck all the immigrants"" and?"" Jeez, I'm sorry. Jeez."
33,20,5,Bedrager,"[in a weird accent] Hello. Are you tired of hate speech? Are you sick of sexism and-a bigotry? Then please, help the Danish put an end to trolls."
34,20,5,Danes,Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
35,20,5,Bedrager,"Right now, the people of Denmark are working on a biometric computer superstructure which will allow people all around the world to identify the trolls in their communities."
36,20,5,Danes,Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
37,20,5,Bedrager,"But to make this dream into a reality, we still need your donations. We are just a few million kroners away, so please donate via the social media of your choice."
38,20,5,Danes,[four windows open and some Danes sing out] Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
39,20,5,Bedrager,"Just imagine it, knowing who said what on the Internet."
40,20,5,Dane 1,The whole world will be-a peaceful and happy.
41,20,5,Dane 2,"Like-a here, in Denmark."
42,20,5,Dane 3,Help fund our project on social media today!
43,20,5,Danes,"Together, we will rid the world of trolls. Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang tjing nutillej!"
44,20,5,Dick,"Fellow trolls, we have gathered together because our anonymity is being threatened. Individually, we are some of the most notorious trolls in Colorado. We must now find a way to unite. Each one of us has the power to make message boards go haywire, The power to make individuals buckle and fall. Imagine if we use those skills against a common enemy."
45,20,5,Troll 2,They have an entire government at their disposal.
46,20,5,Dick,And we... have Skankhunt42.
47,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,[sighs] It's Gerald. Alright?
48,20,5,Dick,I believe that he... is the key to stopping all this.
49,20,5,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. This school is falling apart, and it needs to stop. Boys are harassing girls, and girls are stereotyping boys as- Not now, Mr. Stotch! Put it away!"
50,20,5,Butters Stotch,[with his pants down and dick out] Well okay. [pulls his pants back up.]
51,20,5,PC Principal,"Now I've asked for some ideas and a couple of students wanna try and help. Please welcome Heidi and Eric. [they come up wearing matching shirts: ""COME TOGETHER as a school""]"
52,20,5,Eric Cartman,Hey you guys?
53,20,5,Heidi Turner,What's up? [the other kids stay silent]
54,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny."
55,20,5,Heidi Turner,"Eheh, stop, Eric."
56,20,5,Eric Cartman,"You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby."
57,20,5,Heidi Turner,"Thanks, babe. I don't know if you guys have heard, but right now, Denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past. They're asking for help, and I thought ""why not a school fundraiser?"""
58,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?"
59,20,5,Heidi Turner,What? How did I say it? [from here their voices get softer and softer until they're whispering to each other]
60,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Remember, you were like ""Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?"" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh-"
61,20,5,Heidi Turner,When was this? Were we at Denny's?
62,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?"
63,20,5,Heidi Turner,"[giggling] Oh, and you kept spilling it and everything?"
64,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it"
65,20,5,Heidi Turner,He had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head.
66,20,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that..."
67,20,5,Heidi Turner,Then we should all come together [mimicking Cartman] as a skewl. [Cartman giggles and sighs happily. Bebe throws up involuntarily]
68,20,5,Advisor 1,"Sir, what were you thinking? We said to be careful how you talked about women."
69,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"[satisfied with himself] Yeah I don't know, I guess I just kind of screwed the pooch on that one. [checks for any Pabst Blue Ribbon cans with beer left in them]"
70,20,5,Chris Christie,We are way down in the polls. I don't know how we recover from this.
71,20,5,Herbert Garrison,Oh really? Jeez that's too bad. [dusts off his pants and checks his shoes]
72,20,5,Chris Christie,A lot of us have staked our lives on backing you! You can't just go bonkers like this!
73,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Hey, sorry. I didn't realize women were racists."
74,20,5,Advisor 2,You have... millions of supporters who are looking to you to lead! They're gonna wanna know what you're gonna do about this!
75,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"I mean, I don't know. Nothin'. Whatever."
76,20,5,Chris Christie,You wanna tell them that? They're outside. [Garrison is horrified.]
77,20,5,Supporter 1,What's goin' on?!
78,20,5,Supporter 2,What are ya doin?!
79,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"[steps outside] Oh, uh hey everybody. Uh, looks like we're tanking in the polls, but you know what? It's fixed. I was never gonna win in the first place. I knew it from the beginning. And on November 8th, when I lose, I'll be able to say ""I told you so!"" [grins. The crowd is not amused.]"
80,20,5,Supporter 2,This son of a bitch pulled a fast one on us!
81,20,5,Supporter 3,It's like he's not even trying!
82,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Oh no, I'm I'm trying. I just-"
83,20,5,Supporter 2,Get him!
84,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Shiiit! [he runs off, and the crowd gives chase] Ohhh Jeeez! [people in the crowd come armed with shovels, pitchforks, bats, axes, knives, guns... One person even has a chainsaw he has trouble starting up.]"
85,20,5,Supporters,Kill him! Tear his head off! Don't let him get away!
86,20,5,Supporter 4,[ginally gets that chainsaw going] Yeah haw!
87,20,5,Andrew,[knocks on the door]
88,20,5,Anonymous821,What do you want? Go away.
89,20,5,Andrew,"Hey, just checking to see if you needed any more refreshments for the conference room?"
90,20,5,Anyomous821,We're fine. We don't need anything.
91,20,5,A Troll,[within the room] Some more creamer?
92,20,5,Anonymous821,Just some more creamer.
93,20,5,Andrew,"Alright, well, I just wanna say ""thanks for choosing the-"" [the troll shuts the door]"
94,20,5,Anonymous821,"Okay, we're clear again."
95,20,5,Dick,"You were saying, Skankhunt?"
96,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Alright, look. How do you troll somebody?"
97,20,5,Troll 4,Say really fucked up shit and make them quit social media?
98,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh."
99,20,5,Anonymous821,Wow... that seems kind of... mean.
100,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,It's not mean if it's hilarious.
101,20,5,Dick,"If we all worked with you, Skank, could we do it? Could we troll an entire country?"
102,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,If we all worked together? Maybe. [makes a fist with his left hand] Maybe.
103,20,5,Heidi Turner,"Hey guys. Today we're gonna start our school fundraiser. It's an idea I came up with called ""Danishes for Denmark."""
104,20,5,Eric Cartman,[almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome.
105,20,5,Heidi Turner,"We need everyone to do their part, so later on in the cafeteria, we are all gonna need to- [the classroom door opens and Heidi looks to see who opened it. Mr. Garrison rushes in and gets to work immediately]"
106,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"[frantic] Okay children, let's take our seats! Let's uh, get back to our lessons on grammar, shall we?"
107,20,5,Stan Marsh,Mr. Garrison?
108,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Okay, does anybody, uh, remember where we left off? No? Alright, uh, who can tell me what an adjective is? [to Mrs. Nelson] You can go now, I'm back. [to the class] Who can t-who can tell me what an adjective is?"
109,20,5,Token Black,"Uh, aren't you running for President?"
110,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"Adjectives usually come before what? They come before nouns, that's right."
111,20,5,Chris Christie,"[clears his throat] Mr. Garrison, you can't just act like nothing happened! You're spiraling out of control, and you have to answer to the people!"
112,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"I don't know what you're talking about! I am a teacher! [back to the board] Okay, adjectives describe nouns, and there are several types of them-"
113,20,5,Chris Christie,Mr. Garrison.
114,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"What are some examples of adjectives you can give me for this sentence? Anybody? [writes ""Jack threw the  ball."" on the board.]"
115,20,5,Chris Christie,"You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison, and you have to make good on it!"
116,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"The yellow ball. That's a good one. Or we can say ""the slippery ball,"" can't we?"
117,20,5,Chris Christie,Come on. [his advisers come in.]
118,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"What else about the ball? No, please! [The advisers gather around him and carry him off] What else can we say about the ball, children? No, please! Leave me alone!"
119,20,5,Butters Stotch,The bouncy ball?
120,20,5,Herbert Garrison,"[grabs a chalk stick and scratches it against the blackboard] No! No, I'm not going back! Please! They're gonna kill me, children! Please! Help me, children! Help me! [Chris Christie shuts the door]"
121,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, come on. Office is upstairs. [they run into Sheila] Oh, hi honey."
122,20,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, you're back from your convention?"
123,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up."
124,20,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, can I make you guys somethin' to eat?"
125,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much! [he and Dick go on upstairs.] Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins."
126,20,5,Dick,Hello. [Gerald closes the door]
127,20,5,Dick,"I gotta hand it to you, Gerald. You have a really nice home, nice family."
128,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am.
129,20,5,Dick,And who is that?
130,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,What?
131,20,5,Dick,I've studied your work. You're so good at lashing out at the system. Bringing people down off their high horses. Why do you do it?
132,20,5,Gerald Broflovski,"I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz."
133,20,5,Dick,"I don't believe that. I think there's more to Skankhunt. When I was in school, kids teased me. Called me ""midget,"" even though I'm not. My mother was a little person, but she actually married a guy who had gigantism syndrome. She thought, if she was a little person and had a baby with a giant, I would come out normal. [Gerald stifles a laugh] We can't let these Danish pricks take our online lives, Skank. For some of us... it's all we have."
134,20,5,Heidi and Cartman,Let's come together as a skewl.
135,20,5,Eric Cartman,We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that
136,20,5,Heidi and Cartman,We came together as a skewl.
