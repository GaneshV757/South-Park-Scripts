0,9,6,Stan Marsh,"[impatiently tapping the table] Dude, where is she? We can't wait."
1,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"God, this is gonna be sooo yummy."
2,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!"
3,9,6,Sharon Marsh,Hi boys.
4,9,6,Stan Marsh,Mom!
5,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,She's here!
6,9,6,Eric Cartman,She's got Colonel!
7,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,I want some!
8,9,6,Eric Cartman,Oh boy!
9,9,6,Stan Marsh,[twirling around] I want a breast!
10,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy?"
11,9,6,Sharon Marsh,"Uuh uh uh, not so fast. You boys can help bring in the other groceries in the car, then have your chicken."
12,9,6,The Boys,Awww!
13,9,6,Stan Marsh,"But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!"
14,9,6,Sharon Marsh,It won't take a minute.
15,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast."
16,9,6,Stan Marsh,All right.
17,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[firmly] Let's go. Oh my God, that smells good. [Cartman stays behind and quickly sits back down. As the other boys head out of the kitchen, Cartman rips the skins off the chicken pieces and wolfs them down. Sharon and the other boys return with the groceries.]"
18,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, this is everything, mom. [the boys return to their seats]"
19,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, let's eat Colonel! [Cartman leaves as the others sit]"
20,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh, boy! [they see the denuded chicken pieces. Stan looks at Cartman in anger] Cartman, you ate the skin off of EVERY PIECE OF CHICKEN!"
21,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Well, I saved you all the chicken part. [quiet burp]"
22,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,The skin's the best part...
23,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[puts on his jacket] Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow. [he leaves the kitchen. The boys are puzzled as to what to do about it. Burying his head in his arms, Kenny sobs]"
24,9,6,Stan Marsh,I can't believe that fat asshole!
25,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
26,9,6,Stan Marsh,Well this time he's gone too far!
27,9,6,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, fuck him!)"
28,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?"
29,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
30,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!"
31,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, but he thrives on that."
32,9,6,Stan Marsh,"All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him."
33,9,6,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck yeah!)
34,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,That sounds great!
35,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[arriving] Hey fags, what's going on? [no one says a word] Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. [silence]"
36,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
37,9,6,Stan Marsh,I think I have extra.
38,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one. [Stan fishes around for some money in his pockets, walks over a bit, and gives it to Kyle] Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?"
39,9,6,Stan Marsh,Here you go.
40,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks. [Stan returns to his post next to Kenny]
41,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Dude, Stan, yuh you know why Jews have glassy eyes? Like Kyle? [neither of them says a thing] Eh. K-Kenny, you see that chick on the news that had her left titty cut off? [chuckles. Kenny scratches his right side a bit] Kenny? Kenny?? [the bus pulls up and opens the door. The boys head inside. Stan enters first] Stan? Stan, it's me, Eric! [Kenny enters next] Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents? [Kyle enters last] Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here! [Seeing no reaction, Cartman is stunned. The door closes and the bus pulls away] Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were... [close-up] dead. [dramatic music] No. No, I can't be dead. [runs off] I can't be dead!!"
42,9,6,Black Plumber,"All right, ma'am. We've got your new toilet installed and we'll haul away the old one away for ya."
43,9,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh, you've been so helpful, I uh, just don't know how to thank you."
44,9,6,Black Plumber,"Hunh, I could think of a few ways, hunh."
45,9,6,Liane Cartman,"Ohoho, nhn."
46,9,6,Eric Cartman,No! No!!
47,9,6,Fat Plumber,What happened? Did they say?
48,9,6,Thin Plumber,Apparently there was so much chicken skin in the system it just ruptured the insides.
49,9,6,Fat Plumber,"Aww, that's tragic."
50,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, this can't be happening! [he then hears his mother wailing softly, then louder] Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true! [he gets closer to her window. Inside his mother's room, on her bed, the black plumber is pounding Liane from behind, but the bed's noise does not reach Cartman's ears. Cartman turns, wailing.] Oh, it's not fair! [falls to his knees and cries out] Why??? Why??? [cries some more. Liane cries out some more as well]"
51,9,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman? [Kyle catches a football]"
52,9,6,Stan Marsh,Cartman isn't our friend anymore. [throws the football back]
53,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,We're ignoring him.
54,9,6,Token Black,Ignoring him? How come?
55,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,Because he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
56,9,6,Token Black,Oh yeah.
57,9,6,Craig Tucker,"Hey, I hate Cartman too. Can I ignore him with you?"
58,9,6,Blond,Yeah.
59,9,6,Kevin Stoley,Me too.
60,9,6,Other boys,"Yeah, screw him! Yeah."
61,9,6,Clyde Donovan,I never realized ignoring him was an option.
62,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[arriving] Guys! Guys? [the two teams are seen: On screen left are Jimmy, Token, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. On screen right are Timmy, Craig, Clyde, Kevin, and the blond boy. The teams toss the football at each other] Can anybody hear me? You guys?? [approaches Token] Token, Token, I'm here! [leaves] Hello! Hello! Hello! [approaches Clyde] Clyde, can't you feel me? [moves him around, but no reaction from Clyde] Feel me, Clyde! [moves on to Jimmy] Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric! [blows on Jimmy] Jimmy! [puff] Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me! [turns away] They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead. [begins to tear up] Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul."
63,9,6,Woman,What is that kid doing?
64,9,6,Man,"Ah I don't know, just ignore him."
65,9,6,Butters,"Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-"
66,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[walking by, lamenting his fate] What did I do to deserve this?! [Butters pays attention] How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!"
67,9,6,Butters,Hey Eric! [goes back to shoveling snow. Cartman stops in his tracks]
68,9,6,Eric Cartman,...What did you say?
69,9,6,Butters,"Huh I just said, ""Hey Eric!"""
70,9,6,Eric Cartman,Butters... [runs back to Butters] Butters! You can see me??
71,9,6,Butters,"Well, sure I can see you."
72,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, and you can hear me??"
73,9,6,Butters,"[giggles] Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?"
74,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Because, Butters, I'm... dead. [a few moments of silence]"
75,9,6,Butters,"[screams and drops his shovel and runs off, hiding behind the family car. Cartman follows him]"
76,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!"
77,9,6,Butters,You died?? How??
78,9,6,Eric Cartman,I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
79,9,6,Butters,"But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?"
80,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, but you're the only one who can."
81,9,6,Butters,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [runs toward the front door, opens it and runs inside, slamming it shut]"
82,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters! [tries to open the door, then pounds on it furiously] Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!"
83,9,6,Linda Stotch,"Butters, what on earth are you doing??"
84,9,6,Butters,Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
85,9,6,Linda Stotch,Dead people?
86,9,6,Stephen Stotch,Who's seeing dead people?
87,9,6,Butters,Me! I saw a ghost!
88,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts."
89,9,6,Butters,But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
90,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you."
91,9,6,Butters,"Ruh, really?"
92,9,6,Stephen Stotch,Yeess.
93,9,6,Butters,So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
94,9,6,Stephen Stotch,That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.
95,9,6,Butters,Huh s-s-super-AIDS?
96,9,6,Stephen Stotch,That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.
97,9,6,Butters,AAAH! [drops his flashlight] Oh Jesus.
98,9,6,Stephen Stotch,So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.
99,9,6,Butters,"Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder. [closes his eyes, but a thunderclap opens his eyes wide] Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. [he looks out the window again. Cartman is seen standing by the bedroom door]"
100,9,6,Eric Cartman,Butters...
101,9,6,Butters,[points] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [turns away and ducks under his covers]
102,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you have to help me!"
103,9,6,Butters,Go away! You aren't real!
104,9,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. [pulls out a chain, rattles it, and utters ghostly sounds]"
105,9,6,Butters,"[panics, screaming] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [Cartman leaves the bedside and hides. Butters' door opens and his parents walk in]"
106,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, what is going on?!"
107,9,6,Butters,Well I saw... [points to... nothing] Well he was... [sees there's nothing to prove] Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
108,9,6,Stephen Stotch,Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!
109,9,6,Butters,"Y yes, yes sir. [they leave, but Stephen takes one last quick look around, then closes the door. Butters mumbles a few things, then tries to sleep]"
110,9,6,Eric Cartman,[suddenly on the bed] Butters.
111,9,6,Butters,AH- [quickly muffles his mouth so his parents don't hear]
112,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!"
113,9,6,Butters,But I don't want to see you!
114,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven."
115,9,6,Butters,Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?
116,9,6,Eric Cartman,What do you mean?
117,9,6,Butters,Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
118,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!"
119,9,6,Butters,Oh.
120,9,6,Eric Cartman,Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
121,9,6,Butters,"I can't. Ahah, I have school tomorrow."
122,9,6,Eric Cartman,"This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life! [brings out the chain, rattles it, and makes ghostly noises with his voice]"
123,9,6,Butters,"Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!"
124,9,6,Butters,Mrs. Cartman?
125,9,6,Liane Cartman,Yes? [turns around] Oh hi.
126,9,6,Butters,"This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something."
127,9,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh, what is it?"
128,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I love her."
129,9,6,Butters,"He says, he love you. [Cartman sobs]"
130,9,6,Liane Cartman,"[moved] Oh, that's so nice."
131,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[emotional] Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!"
132,9,6,Butters,He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
133,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[emotional] It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!"
134,9,6,Butters,"He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted."
135,9,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins! [sobs. Cartman sobs too, and then Butters sobs in sympathy]"
136,9,6,Butters,"Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew. [Cartman sobs. Kyle looks, then gets annoyed] He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times."
137,9,6,Eric Cartman,Just the good times.
138,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
139,9,6,Eric Cartman,I can't! Don't you understand?!
140,9,6,Butters,He can't! Don't you understand?!
141,9,6,Eric Cartman,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!"
142,9,6,Butters,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!"
143,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[whips out a notepad] All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. [turns around and walk off]"
144,9,6,Butters,"Uhh alright then. [Butters turns to follow, and Kyle is left looking puzzled]"
145,9,6,Stan Marsh,Who was that?
146,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
147,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he did that to me this morning."
148,9,6,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
149,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle."
150,9,6,Kenny McCormick,(That guy would try anything)
151,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we know better than to think that."
152,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's everyone, I guess. [turns around] All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you."
153,9,6,Butters,"[shuffles his right foot out of modesty] Aww, that's okay, Eric."
154,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[puts away the notepad in his inside jacket pocket.] Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now."
155,9,6,Butters,So I won't see you again?
156,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash."
157,9,6,Butters,Wow.
158,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[backs up and waves his hands in front of him as if in a haze] G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! [Cartman steps back a bit more, then stops, then is annoyed]"
159,9,6,Butters,Yeh you're still here.
160,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?"
161,9,6,Butters,"Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough."
162,9,6,Eric Cartman,What else do I have to do?!
163,9,6,Butters,"Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did."
164,9,6,Eric Cartman,Atone?
165,9,6,Butters,Did you ever do anything really bad?
166,9,6,Eric Cartman,[thinks] Not really...
167,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it."
168,9,6,Butters,[writing] Broke fence...
169,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid."
170,9,6,Butters,"Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for."
171,9,6,Eric Cartman,Really?
172,9,6,Butters,"Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this."
173,9,6,Eric Cartman,I know how.
174,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna make, make it right.
I'm gonna take a little time and set things right.
Make, make it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
It feels so good to be making up
For all the things I've done wrong.
I know now what the Good Lord in Heaven
Wanted from me all along.
All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.
'Cause Jesus wants me to have a clean slate.
Not faking it, I'm making it right.
I'm payin' for my sins and it sure feels great.
Make, make it right!
Make, make it right!
Gonna make it right, girl, I've got to have your lovin' tonight!"
175,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, there's everything, Butters. [stands up and walks off a bit] I've made everything right."
176,9,6,Butters,Does this mean... you have to go now?
177,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave. [waves his hands around again as if in a haze] Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye... [his back hits the wall under the window, and he looks at his hands] Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!"
178,9,6,Butters,Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
179,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?! [grabs Butters' bat and begins destroying his room with it. First to go is the lamp on top of the foot locker, then something else, then a picture of Butters sitting on a tree stump, then the television, then the television stand, ] Do you think this is funny,..?"
180,9,6,Butters,"Eric! Calm down. [Cartman destroys the bookshelves, then the toy area] Stupid butthole God! [chucks the bat at Butters, who leans out of the way. The bat smashes his mirror apart. Cartman leaves. Butters surveys the damage, then his parents show up]"
181,9,6,Stephen Stotch,Butters! What have you done?!
182,9,6,Butters,I-I-it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
183,9,6,Linda Stotch,"Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor."
184,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him."
185,9,6,Linda Stotch,"What do you think, Doctor?"
186,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests.
187,9,6,Linda Stotch,Oh no. [buries her face in Stephen's shoulder] NO!
188,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,"[in a booth with Butters' parents] All right, Butters, just try to relax. [two robot arms grab Butters along the sides of his torso and head, pick him up, and flip him over] Doin' just fine, Butters. [the arms reposition themselves and raise Butters a little higher. A big red anal probe closes in and begins to vibrate] Just stay perfectly still now, Butters."
189,9,6,Butters,"[nervous, tries to look back] Lu lu lu, lu lu lu [the anal probe enters and shakes him violently]"
190,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,"Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters. [the probe takes one last, deep jab. Then, to Stephen.] Don't worry, Mr. Stotch. Whatever traumatized your son in his past, we'll find it. [the robot arms now rock Butters back and forth as the probe does its stuff.]"
191,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,"Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear."
192,9,6,Butters,So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
193,9,6,Stephen Stotch,"Now do you believe us, Butters?"
194,9,6,Butters,Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.
195,9,6,Mental Health Doctor,"Good. We're making a lot of headway. We'll do some more testing tomorrow. All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest. [they leave]"
196,9,6,Linda Stotch,"[stays behind long enough to kiss Butters on the forehead] Goodnight, baby. [leaves. The lights go out]"
197,9,6,Butters,[relaxing and sleeps...] Ahhh. [...but Cartman appears at the foot of the bed]
198,9,6,Eric Cartman,Butters.
199,9,6,Butters,AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
200,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here."
201,9,6,Butters,"Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore."
202,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look! [shows Butters an ad for a psychic] Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!"
203,9,6,Butters,"Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event."
204,9,6,Eric Cartman,She's gonna close soon! Come on! [pulls Butters out of bed and away]
205,9,6,Butters,Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
206,9,6,Butters,"[still with heavy eyelids] Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?"
207,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic",Certainly. Come in. [Butters and Cartman follow her in] Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.
208,9,6,Butters,"Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane."
209,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic","Well, many times, the reason that the soul stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event."
210,9,6,Butters,"Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!"
211,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic","But now, you shouldn't think you're crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time."
212,9,6,Butters,Really?
213,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic",Yes. When's the last time you saw yours?
214,9,6,Butters,"Well, he's sittin' next to me right now."
215,9,6,"Dr. Lindsay, Psychic",AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [runs out of the room screaming. The TV turns on mysteriously behind the boys]
216,9,6,Butters,"Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost."
217,9,6,Eric Cartman,"I told you, Butters. [a breaking news item comes on]"
218,9,6,Announcer,This is breaking news!
219,9,6,Anchor Tom and,A tragic event is unfolding in South Park. Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the Red Cross!
220,9,6,Reporter Chris,"Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash."
221,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!"
222,9,6,Officer,"Stay back, people!"
223,9,6,Man,"Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!"
224,9,6,Det Yates,Stay calm in there. We don't want anybody getting hurt.
225,9,6,Lead Convict,"You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin', man!"
226,9,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages."
227,9,6,Butters,"Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me."
228,9,6,Eric Cartman,Don't worry. I have a plan. [movers towards an entrance]
229,9,6,Butters,"Eric. [Cartman turns around] Well, be careful, ghost pal."
230,9,6,Eric Cartman,"They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. [Cartman moves towards the front door. The detective notices]"
231,9,6,Det Yates,What the hell is that kid doing?
232,9,6,Bald Convict,Somebody's comin' in!
233,9,6,Convict 2,"It's just some little fat kid. [the door opens and Cartman walks in. He starts making haunting, ghostly noises and rattling desks]"
234,9,6,Bald Convict,What the hell is going on?
235,9,6,Convict 2,I have no idea.
236,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, it's working! [hops on a chair, picks up a book, waves it around, and flips the pages in the lead convict's face]"
237,9,6,Lead Convict,"This is really weird. [Cartman walks over to a file cabinet, opens a drawer, and tosses out all sorts of papers. Butters enters the building, walking quietly as Cartman keeps the three convicts distracted]"
238,9,6,Reporter Chris,"An incredible development here, Tom. Two little boys have fearlessly gone inside the Red Cross. [footage of Cartman entering the building is shown]"
239,9,6,Stan Marsh,Cartman?
240,9,6,Bald Convict,"[scratches his head] I'm so confused! [Butters goes over to the office, removes the chair blocking the door, and opens the door.]"
241,9,6,Butters,"Hurry. Go, go! [the hostages leave quickly, quietly. They exit the Red Cross.]"
242,9,6,Officer 2,The hostages are clear!
243,9,6,Det Yates,"[through the bull horn] All right, move in! [the officers move in. Cartman is dancing around shaking the bells and making ghostly noises]"
244,9,6,Convict 2,The hostages are gone!
245,9,6,Bald Convict,What?! [the officers pour in and arrest the convicts] Son of a bitch.
246,9,6,Reporter Chris,"Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes."
247,9,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day."
248,9,6,Butters,"Boy, we sure did."
249,9,6,Eric Cartman,"My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends."
250,9,6,Butters,Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
251,9,6,Eric Cartman,"We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you."
252,9,6,Butters,"I'll miss you too, ghost pal."
253,9,6,Eric Cartman,"[backs up again, waving his hands before him] Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I'll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters! Goodbye! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him from his right side, Clyde, Token and Jimmy approach him from his left]"
254,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey Cartman, that was really cool what you did."
255,9,6,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah Eric, we're gonna stop ignoring you now. [both Cartman and Butters are stunned that everyone can suddenly see Cartman]"
256,9,6,Kyle Broflovski,"We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have."
257,9,6,Stan Marsh,"Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow."
258,9,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. S-see ya, Eric. [Butters looks down]"
259,9,6,Eric Cartman,[pissed off] You sonofabitch Butters!
260,9,6,Butters,Huh?
261,9,6,Eric Cartman,You told me I was a ghost!
262,9,6,Butters,Huh but I thought you were one!
263,9,6,Eric Cartman,"How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to [points his finger at Butters] GET YOU BACK! [runs off. Butters just looks at him, baffled. His parents arrive with the doctor]"
264,9,6,Stephen Stotch,[angered] Butters?!
265,9,6,Butters,Oh hamburgers.
