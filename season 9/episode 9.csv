0,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,What are all you guys doing here?
1,9,9,Clyde Donovan,I don't know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. [shows letter]
2,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, us too."
3,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[closes the door and comes downstairs] Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge."
4,9,9,Craig Tucker,What?
5,9,9,Eric Cartman,"What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future."
6,9,9,Stan Marsh,What?
7,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,How do you know?
8,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
9,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"[in an English accent. Cartman looks on, startled] YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS! [bangs on the table twice with his fist] NOW DAMN YOU, LET HIM SPEAK!"
10,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true. [pulls TV from the back] I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera [shows the camera]. I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children."
11,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Okay. I'm not lookin'. [buries his face in his arms]
12,9,9,Eric Cartman,Video playback initialized. [presses play on the remote control and the screen shows the girls playing]
13,9,9,Girls,[laugh]
14,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!"
15,9,9,Kale,Okay Bebe. What do you want to know?
16,9,9,Bebe Stevens,I want to know if I'm gonna live in a big mansion in the future.
17,9,9,Kale,"Okay, let's find out. Ready? [pulls out a paper fortune teller] Pick a number."
18,9,9,Bebe Stevens,Four.
19,9,9,Kale,"One, two, three, four. Okay, pick a color."
20,9,9,Bebe Stevens,Blue.
21,9,9,Kale,B-L-U-E. All right pick another color
22,9,9,Bebe Stevens,[off-screen]Red.
23,9,9,Kale,"'Kaaay. Okay, will Bebe live in a big mansion in the future? [opens an interior flap] Definitely yes!"
24,9,9,Bebe Stevens,All right!
25,9,9,Girls,"Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!"
26,9,9,Boys,Whoa! Wow!
27,9,9,Red,Do me next. I wanna know if I'm gonna marry somebody cute.
28,9,9,Heidi Turner,I'll do it! I'll do it! [takes the teller from the Kal] Pick a number.
29,9,9,Red,Three.
30,9,9,Heidi Turner,"One, two, three. Now, pick a color."
31,9,9,Clyde Donovan,Where did they get that thing? [Kyle shushes him]
32,9,9,Heidi Turner,G-R-E-E-N.
33,9,9,Red,Now blue!
34,9,9,Heidi Turner,The answer is no. [girls laugh at her]
35,9,9,Red,Aw dangit!
36,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, how does it know the answer?"
37,9,9,Craig Tucker,I... don't believe it.
38,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image! [presses the pause button] Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device."
39,9,9,Eric Cartman,[comes to Clyde and Kevin's table] How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?
40,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"It's all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we're dealing with."
41,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Good man.[goes over to the computer Kyle, Stan, and Token are working on] Any luck here?"
42,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
43,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it. [moves to the middle of the tent] All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here."
44,9,9,Craig Tucker,Let's go take it!
45,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?"
46,9,9,Stan Marsh,So what do you suggest?
47,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Heidi Turner [turns on a projector on which is shown her picture] is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There's no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it."
48,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party."
49,9,9,Eric Cartman,"No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town."
50,9,9,Kevin Stoley,"You mean like that movie, Juwanna Mann?"
51,9,9,Eric Cartman,"No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!"
52,9,9,Stan Marsh,"But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went."
53,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy."
54,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,That's a pretty solid idea. But who?
55,9,9,Officer 1,Mr. and Mrs. Stotch?
56,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Yes? What is it, officer?"
57,9,9,Officer 1,You'd better come quick.
58,9,9,Officer 2,Your son is at the Bowery Building threatening to kill himself.
59,9,9,Linda Stotch,What?!
60,9,9,Officer 3,Don't do it son! You have too much to live for! [a patrol car pulls up with Stephen and Linda]
61,9,9,Linda Stotch,"Oh my God, Butters!"
62,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Oh uh, hi Mom."
63,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[behind Butters] Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. [Clyde, Stan, and Craig dress the pig while Cartman makes a Butter mask for it]"
64,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[grabs the bullhorn from the officer] Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn't the answer. Look at all these people who've come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won't ground you for more than a couple of weeks."
65,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too."
66,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. [the pig is done, Butters steps down, and the pig is shoved into place]"
67,9,9,Linda Stotch,"He, h-he's coming down! Oh thank God!"
68,9,9,Officer 1,"No, wait. What... what's he doing? [the Butters mask appears over the ledge]"
69,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay. One! Two! [Craig, Clyde, and Stan push the dressed pig]"
70,9,9,Officer 3,"JEESUS CHIRST! [Linda screams. The pig drops to the ground and explodes, splattering everyone around with blood and guts]"
71,9,9,Linda Stotch,OHHHH MY GOD!!
72,9,9,Doctor,[walks up to the body and rests his finger on a completely exposed blood vein] He... didn't make it.
73,9,9,Linda Stotch,NOOOOO!! NOOOOO!! My son is DEAD!! NOOOO!!
74,9,9,Eric Cartman,Nice.
75,9,9,Priest Maxi,"And he shall be remembered as the peaceful little boy who warmed his parent's hearts. [Linda sobs uncontrollably] Lord, as we commit this child's body to the earth, may we ask it'd be the last child you strike down so mercilessly. We know this request to be futile, Lord, but just though we would ask. [the casket is lowered]"
76,9,9,Linda Stotch,NOOOO! NOOOO! BUTTERS! [jumps on the casket and Stephen and another woman holds her] Don't put him down there! Don't put him down there!
77,9,9,Ms Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Now I know that we're all still in deep, deep mourning over the tragic death of our classmate, Butters."
78,9,9,Red,Who's Butters?
79,9,9,Ms Garrison,"But we all must try to move on. And so I'd like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to... Marjorine. [Butters enters dressed as Marjorine, a blonde girl, with wig askew]"
80,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Oh... Thank you. [curtsies]
81,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[whispers to Stan]Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. [clears his throat]"
82,9,9,Ms Garrison,"Why don't you tell the children a little bit about yourself, Marjorine?"
83,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and [squeezes his eyes shut] getting my snootch pounded on Friday night."
84,9,9,Clyde Donovan,Nice.
85,9,9,Ms Garrison,"Now Marjorine, that's not very ladylike. Us Colorado girls love to get pounded in the snootch just like any woman, but we keep it to ourselves."
86,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Oh...
87,9,9,Bebe Stevens,That girl sure has a strange sense of fashion.
88,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[pretends like he's yawning]Dude, they totally think he's a girl. [coughs]"
89,9,9,Ms Garrison,"All right, have a seat, Marjorine. I'm sure all the other girls will be happy to show you around the school. [the girls look cross] Won't you, girls?"
90,9,9,Red,Where do you buy your clothes?
91,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places."
92,9,9,Eric Cartman,"[pretends like he's yawning]Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker. [coughs] This is going swimmingly. [coughs]"
93,9,9,Mrs Turner,"[enters the basement carrying a bowl] Heidi, sweetie, I'm just gonna set the snacks over here."
94,9,9,Heidi Turner,'Kay Mom.
95,9,9,Mrs Turner,"Oh, and Heidi, there's going to be one extra girl coming to your slumber party."
96,9,9,Heidi Turner,Who?
97,9,9,Mrs Turner,"The new girl in your class, Marjorine."
98,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Mom, I didn't invite her!"
99,9,9,Mrs Turner,"I know, sweetie, but I got a call from Marjorine's mother."
100,9,9,Heidi Turner,Her mother?
101,9,9,Mrs Turner,"She said Marjorine is having a really hard time being in a new school. Her mom asked me personally if we could have Marjorine over, and besides, her mother told me that she works as a state official and that I should [slows down a bit] respect her authoratay."
102,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Linda? Linda, please come downstairs."
103,9,9,Linda Stotch,[through her tears]Why couldn't we help him? Why is our little boy dead? [continues crying. Stephen leaves her alone and walks downstairs]
104,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[sees Butters on a family portrait] Oh butter! Oh Butters, I miss you so much! [the doorbell rings and he opens the door]"
105,9,9,An old farmer,Mr. Stotch. I know what you're thinkin'.
106,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Who are you?
107,9,9,An old farmer,"[in a spooky accent]I came to talk you out of it. You need to... just accept that your son is dead, not try to bring him back."
108,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Bring him back? W-What are you talking about?
109,9,9,An old farmer,"[comes in] I know you're thinkin' of puttin'; him up there, the Indian Burial Ground up that road. You're thinking if you bury his body there, he will come back alive. Sometimes, dead is better."
110,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Indian... Burial Ground?
111,9,9,An old farmer,"It's been done before, what you're thinkin' of. The Nelson boy, back in '85."
112,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"You're saying if I... dig up my son's body and rebury him at the... old Indian Burial Ground, that I-"
113,9,9,An old farmer,"Don't do it Stotch! What comes out of the ground ain't the thing you put in. The Indians knew that. That's why they stopped using it when the ground went sour. I'm just here to talk you out of it. [walks towards the front door, which is still open, then turns around] Don't bury your son's body at the Indian Burial Ground, Stotch! The one that's right up over there, behind Andersons' bar. Sometimes... dead is better. [walks out]"
114,9,9,Stan Marsh,"All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house."
115,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"[dressed as Marjorine] I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?"
116,9,9,Clyde Donovan,You're gonna be fine.
117,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it."
118,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
119,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there."
120,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
121,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started."
122,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"Good luck, man. [Kyle gives him a push, and Butters is off]"
123,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out. [Kyle glares at him]"
124,9,9,Mr Turner,"All right, now we all want you to have a good time. But as Heidi's parents, tonight it is our responsibility to look out for all of you. There's not gonna be any drinking, no pot, and most importantly, if I catch any boys anywhere near this party, they're gonna be in a world of hurt. [Butters mumbles and sighs a bit] All right, have a nice time, girls. [both parents leave]"
125,9,9,Heidi Turner,"So, what do you guys wanna do first?"
126,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"We could play ""girl talk."" [the other girls approve]"
127,9,9,Red,I bought the new Justin Timberlake CD. We should dance to it. [the other girls approve again]
128,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,How about we read each other's future?
129,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"I know. Let's do ""Light as a feather, stiff as a board."" [the girls approve, then spread out. Kale and Emily light candles and place them on the rug. Bebe turns the lights off, and the girls gather, making a circle around the candles] Who wants to do it first?"
130,9,9,Red,I will. [gets in the middle and lays down]
131,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Oh geez, are we gonna start lezzing out? [the girls look at Butters in astonishment for a moment, then they turn back to the center of the circle]"
132,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Light as a feather, stiff as a board."
133,9,9,Girls,"[getting louder as Red begins to float upwards] Light as a feather, stiff as a board! [Red is floating, making Butters scream]"
134,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, what are they doing in there?"
135,9,9,Eric Cartman,God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
136,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! [Red floats back down, Bebe turn on the lights, and Heidi faces Butters]"
137,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Marjorine, what is your problem?"
138,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?"
139,9,9,Red,"Yeah. I can tell your future, Marjorine! You're going to live alone your entire life because you're a nerdy, dorky geek."
140,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, and your hair is totally stupid. [Butters looks at his hair ashamed]"
141,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"Yeah, and you're flat! [Butters looks down at his chest]"
142,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Marjorine, why don't you just leave? Nobody want you here!"
143,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Hello son. Don't you worry. Daddy's gonna make everything all right again. [begins shoveling dirt out of the way as the sky crackles with thunder and lightning. He finally reaches the coffin and opens it] There he is. There's my boy! Come on, Butters! [lifts the pig out of the coffin] Oh... Butters... you smell like... bacon [carries the carcass] Don't worry. We're gonna bring you back, son. We're gonna bring you back!"
144,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,I think we went too far with Marjorine.
145,9,9,Bebe Stevens,She's in the bathroom crying. [the girls move towards the bathroom]
146,9,9,Heidi Turner,[knocks on bathroom door] Marjorine.
147,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,[sobbing inside] Nobody likes meee...
148,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"Aw gee, she's really upset."
149,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"I feel terrible, you guys. It can't be easy being the new girl in school."
150,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Marjorine? Marjorine? Hey, we didn't mean it."
151,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,You don't know how hard it is to be me. [continues sobbing]
152,9,9,Bebe Stevens,"Marjorine, we were just teasing. We think you're great."
153,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,You think I'm ugly-ehehee...
154,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"You're not ugly, Marjorine."
155,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,You said I'm ugly and flat.
156,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Marjorine, you just have a different look, that's all. We just... we need to help you bring out your inner beauty."
157,9,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?"
158,9,9,Girls,Yeah. Let's go!
159,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,[opens the door] You mean it?
160,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's been too long. Something's wrong.[Craig takes out binoculars to look]"
161,9,9,Stan Marsh,Maybe they found him out.
162,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"Then, he's already dead."
163,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we gotta go check on him. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny move towards the house, reaching the storm cellar.]"
164,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Can you see anything? [the boys see Butters dancing with the other girls to Justin Timberlake's song ""Rock Your Body""]"
165,9,9,Stan Marsh,He's just dancing around.
166,9,9,Eric Cartman,That son of a bitch!
167,9,9,Mrs Turner,"Marjorine, sweetie your mom's on the phone."
168,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,[stops dancing] My mom? [goes upstairs to the kitchen to answer the phone] Hello?
169,9,9,Eric Cartman,Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
170,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends."
171,9,9,Eric Cartman,"You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device."
172,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Well, I'm workin' on it."
173,9,9,Eric Cartman,Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
174,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Now look! I'm getting pretty sick of this! Well I put myself through a lot, and you can't talk to me like that! Uh... mom."
175,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! [hangs up]"
176,9,9,Red,"Hey Marjorine, you wanna know your future?"
177,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?"
178,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Sure. [hands the future teller to Butters, but doesn't take it yet] Here, you do my future."
179,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,How?
180,9,9,Heidi Turner,"Well uh you know, it's easy. You just put your thumbs and index fingers in here..."
181,9,9,Mr Turner,Aha! I knew it! Boys in the slumber party!
182,9,9,Heidi Turner,There's a boy here?
183,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"[moves towards the stairs pointing the future device] Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! [runs up the stairs and outside]"
184,9,9,Craig Tucker,He got it! He got the device! [the boys surround Butters]
185,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! [Clyde runs up, gets it, and runs off]"
186,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Butters."
187,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! [takes off his make up and runs off]"
188,9,9,Heidi Turner,[appears at the doorway with her mom and dad and the other girls] What the hell?
189,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! [turns around and runs as the other boys run away]"
190,9,9,Heidi Turner,...Anybody have a piece of notebook paper so I can make another one?
191,9,9,Jason White,"Go! Go! Get in the containment field! [Clyde enters it and takes the future device attached to a stick, to the incubation shield. He places it inside. A glass covers it and seals it. Clyde then takes off his clothes and enters a decontamination shower]"
192,9,9,Linda Stotch,"Stephen, you did what??"
193,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"I had to, Linda. If there was even the slightest chance it would bring him back! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing anymore!"
194,9,9,Linda Stotch,You dug up our son's body? Performed some kind of pagan ritual?
195,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Linda, I did it for you, you wanted him back so much! So did I!"
196,9,9,Linda Stotch,"Not like this! [slows the voice down] Not like this. He wouldn't be our son, Stephen. He would be a walking abomination. An unholy demon spawn! [knocks are heard on the front door and they both gasp]"
197,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Hello?
198,9,9,Stephen Stotch,It's him.
199,9,9,Linda Stotch,Keep the door locked.
200,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. [his parents are horrified]"
201,9,9,Linda Stotch,"Oh God... [Butters knocks again, then tries to turn the doorknob.] No! [Butters keeps trying to open the door, Linda hides her face on Stephen's shoulder. Silence. Linda begins to cry]"
202,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[soothes her] It's gone, dear. It's gone. Forgive me."
203,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"[enters through the back door] Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- [Linda screams and hides behind the couch]"
204,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Oh God, it's terrible. What have I done?!"
205,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me."
206,9,9,Linda Stotch,It isn't right! Make it go away!
207,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. [handles the future-telling device with black gloves]"
208,9,9,Stan Marsh,Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
209,9,9,Eric Cartman,"No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions."
210,9,9,Clyde Donovan,How come you get to use it first?
211,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Because I do, Clyde."
212,9,9,Craig Tucker,I wanna use it.
213,9,9,Eric Cartman,I'm askin' the first question! Let's just start with something simple. Will Kyle die before he's twenty?
214,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,Wait! I don't wanna know that!
215,9,9,Clyde Donovan,Ask if the Broncos are gonna win on Sunday.
216,9,9,Jason White,"Nah dude, then it won't be fun tow watch."
217,9,9,Eric Cartman,Will you all shut up so I can do this!?
218,9,9,Craig Tucker,"You shut up, asshole."
219,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! [everyone starts arguing]"
220,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Guys, guys, guys, stop! [everyone goes silent] Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now."
221,9,9,Jason White,How could be nothing but trouble?
222,9,9,Stan Marsh,We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
223,9,9,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah. Forget about the girls. What about if the CIA or, or the Russians know we have this? They'll come after us for sure."
224,9,9,Craig Tucker,Maybe we should take it so someplace safer.
225,9,9,Stan Marsh,And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
226,9,9,Bradley Biggle,You mean destroy it?
227,9,9,Eric Cartman,Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
228,9,9,Stan Marsh,"We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are."
229,9,9,Eric Cartman,Think of the power!
230,9,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's too much power. For anybody. Stan's right. It has to be destroyed.
231,9,9,Eric Cartman,Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
232,9,9,Stan Marsh,"Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. [Kenny presses the button, the device explodes, destroying the surrounding area; the explosion is seen from space. Cartman and Kenny get up covered in ashes]"
233,9,9,Eric Cartman,"Damn, Ken."
234,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Here. Here, you see? It's going to be all right. Hello... son. [Butters is shown shackled by the neck with chains attached to the basement walls]"
235,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Hi Dad.
236,9,9,Linda Stotch,He was supposed to stay dead!
237,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?"
238,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Sorry, son, but... you're a demon spawn now. You're an abomination."
239,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry."
240,9,9,Linda Stotch,It's... hungry.
241,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, it must feed."
242,9,9,Rachel,"Hello, I'm Rachel with Quality Curtains."
243,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[nervously] Oh yes, thank you for coming."
244,9,9,Rachel,Which room are we looking at?
245,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Just follow me to the basement.
246,9,9,Linda Stotch,Yes. The basement.
247,9,9,Rachel,"[Rachel enters the basement; she begins walking down the stairs] Oh my, it's pretty dark down here. You sure you need curtains? [sees Butters shackled up] Oh my God!"
248,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,"Uh hello, I'm Butters."
249,9,9,Rachel,"Little boy, what are you doing here? [Stephen kills Rachel with one hit of a shovel]"
250,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Huh?
251,9,9,Stephen Stotch,"[shoves Rachel's corpse closer to Butters with the shovel] Here you go, son. Eat!"
252,9,9,Linda Stotch,What are we becoming?!
253,9,9,Stephen Stotch,Come on. Don't watch it eat. [they turn around and go up the stairs]
254,9,9,Butters Stotch/Marjorine,Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?
