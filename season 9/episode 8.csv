0,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you are right, Cartman. Your uncle Roy has a sweet boat."
1,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around."
2,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Man, I wish I could really drive this thing."
3,9,8,Eric Cartman,You know how?
4,9,8,Stan Marsh,Sure I do!
5,9,8,Eric Cartman,Well here. [reaches down to grab something] Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
6,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it."
7,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Nobody's gonna know. We just drive it around the marina real quick. Look, if anything happens, I'll take full responsibility."
8,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[reaches over and grabs the keys.] Okay, turn on the ignition,"
9,9,8,Eric Cartman,[puts on sunglasses as the engine purrs to life] Awesome.
10,9,8,Stan Marsh,Okay... [pulls on a handle]
11,9,8,Eric Cartman,We're not moving.
12,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[pulls harder. The motor creates a froth of water behind the boat, which is still in place]"
13,9,8,Eric Cartman,Maybe you have the parking brake on.
14,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! [presses that and the boat lunges out of its landing, spinning around a few times as it jumps another dock nearby. The boat goes forward in a haphazard manner. Both boys scream]"
15,9,8,Eric Cartman,Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
16,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[pushes the handle forward again, but it breaks in his hand. He can no longer control the boat, so he and Cartman scream again, then] Jesus Christ!!!"
17,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Stan... beaver dam! [the boat approaches the dam quuickly] Very large beaver dam, Stan!! [the boat runs aground on the dam and the boys quickly jump out. The boat begins to smoke as the boys swim to the nearest shore. Stan, being lighter and faster, reaches shore first, then turns to wait for Cartman. The boat blows up and Stan shields his eyes. Cartman reaches the shore and walks up to Stan]"
18,9,8,Stan Marsh,Oh dude! Oh Jesus!
19,9,8,Eric Cartman,[turns around and sees] Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
20,9,8,Stan Marsh,You said you'd take responsibility to your uncle Roy!
21,9,8,Eric Cartman,I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
22,9,8,Stan Marsh,What?
23,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! [hustles up the beach]"
24,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh God, I hope I didn't hurt any beavers."
25,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns to look at Stan] Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! [Cartman turns back and continues up the beach. Stan turns and follows Cartman up]"
26,9,8,Announcer,"With an eye on America and all of today's events, it's South Park Evening News, with Tom Pusslicker"
27,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"Herro, crisis and fear tonight, as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of Beaverton, Colorado, home of the world's largest beaver dam. [the Marshes are shown eating off small folding tables with dinners on them and looking at the TV] Earlier today, a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open, trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives. [a helicopter camera catches the flooding]"
28,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my gosh, those poor people."
29,9,8,Field Reporter Mitch,"Tom, I'm currently ten miles outside of Beaverton, unable to get inside the town proper. We do not have any reports of fatalities yet, but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions. Beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand, Tom, so this would be quite devastating."
30,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"Any word on how the survivors in the town are doing, Mitch? [Stan has stopped eating. Sharon and Shelly continue.]"
31,9,8,Field Reporter Mitch,"W-we're not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of Beaverton, uh Tom, but we're reporting that there's looting, raping, and yes, even acts of cannibalism."
32,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"My God, you've, you've actually seen people looting, raping and eating each other?"
33,9,8,Field Reporter Mitch,"No, no, we haven't actually seen it Tom, we're just reporting it."
34,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"[rises and begins to pick up the spent trays] You all done with your fishsticks, Stan?"
35,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[rises and takes his own tray up] I'll help you, Sharon. [looks at the screen] Boy, that's just awful."
36,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"In the nearby town of South Park, the cause of the Beaverton flood is being investigated."
37,9,8,Man 1,That's right! We know whose fault this is!
38,9,8,Stan Marsh,Huh oh. [puts his hands to his cheeks. Shelly gives him a funny look]
39,9,8,Man 1,It's George Bush's fault!
40,9,8,Man 2,Yeah! George Bush doesn't care about beavers!
41,9,8,Man 3,George Bush didn't break that beaver dam! It was terrorists and Al Qaeda!
42,9,8,Man 4,They've been secretly building beaver dam WMDs for years now! [a few other voices rise up to mention WMDs]
43,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad? [hesitating] Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?"
44,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"I don't know. You know, to me, it seems like the mayor of Beaverton should've done something about that dam years ago."
45,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault."
46,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Ye-but, uh, s-somebody's gonna help the people off their, their rooftops, right?"
47,9,8,Randy Marsh,"That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. [nothing more is exchanged between Stan and his parents]"
48,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?"
49,9,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah.
50,9,8,Stan Marsh,You saw all those people trapped on their roofs?
51,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Shyeah, that was pretty funny."
52,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!"
53,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Hehey, no no! We aren't the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam, okay?! That's their fault!"
54,9,8,Stan Marsh,But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
55,9,8,Eric Cartman,Well they should've gotten out of there!
56,9,8,Stan Marsh,Maybe they couldn't get out!
57,9,8,Eric Cartman,We did!
58,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, ah I just... [walks around in a fog of worry] ah I don't know what to do here."
59,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!"
60,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up behind Stan] Hey dudes. [Stan stands to one side so he can see Kyle clearly] Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. What'd you guys do?
61,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[looks at Cartman, then] Nothing"
62,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[smiling proudly] Hngh, totally."
63,9,8,Butters Stotch,"[appearing] Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! [the other kids present in the hall follow Butters away. Kyle goes as well.]"
64,9,8,Eric Cartman,[throws down his cap] Aw crap!
65,9,8,Mr Mackey,"Quiet, children, quiet! We need to hear."
66,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,"At first, nobody knew what caused the dam to break, but now, shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in Beaverton was caused by... global warming! [everyone gasps. A new graphic appears onscreen - a globe] It now appears that... all rumors of global warming were true. We were warned this would happen and ...we didn't listen! [buries his face in his hands in anguish] We didn't listen! [composes himself] All the top Colorado geologists have gathered at the governor's office for an emergency meeting."
67,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. [excited voices fill the room]"
68,9,8,Geologist 1,"Excuse me, sir, but, ...when? When is this going to happen?"
69,9,8,Randy Marsh,"My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. [excited voices fill the room again: ""Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots!""]"
70,9,8,Geologist 2,"[an elderly gent] Excuse me, I'm sure we're all very impressed with your wild theories, Doctor uh, Marsh, but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed that global warming exists. Are you suggesting we shut down the economy?!"
71,9,8,Randy Marsh,"With all due respect, cliché dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. [excited voices fill the room again: ""Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots! Peas and carrots!"" The double doors open]"
72,9,8,Scientist 1,Listen! Listen! We've finished running the tests!
73,9,8,Scientist 2,Global Warming is going to strike... two days before the day after tomorrow.
74,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[alarmed] Oh my God... That's today! [a few seconds of silence, then all the geologists begin to panic. Papers fly around the room as most of the geologists run outside.]"
75,9,8,Man 5,[runs by in front of the school] We didn't listen!
76,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[pulls up in the family car, with everybody else already inside] Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!"
77,9,8,Man 6,"[runs by in front of the camera] We didn't listen! [Wendy and her father run by, Anne and her mother run by.]"
78,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[beeping his own horn] Come onnn, come on!"
79,9,8,Sharon Marsh,It's useless. This traffic isn't moving!
80,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all."
81,9,8,Randy Marsh,"No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems."
82,9,8,Driver,We didn't listen!
83,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[hears this and rolls down his window] We, we didn't listen! [rolls up his window] Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! [the Marshes get out the car, carrying what they can, and leave the highway. In town the looting continues. An elderly man carrying a TV comes into view...]"
84,9,8,Man 7,"[drops the TV and points] Oh Jesus, here it comes!"
85,9,8,Man 8,"Global warming! [everyone runs away from whatever the man was pointing to, and soon the street is empty.]"
86,9,8,Man 9,[in the middle of the crowd] It's coming! Here comes global warming!
87,9,8,Man 1,"We didn't listen! [a camera in the sky begins to act the part of Global Warming as it focuses on a man and zooms in on him. The man turns and freezes in his tracks. The POV changes to a camera on the sidewalk watching the man's reactions. The man turns over a few times and stops moving, but no other camera is seen]"
88,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[moving along with his family] Come on, hurry! [the panicking crowd overtakes them]"
89,9,8,Man 11,"It's right behind us! [the Marshes stop to let the crowd through, then start moving again. The crowd returns and passes them again in the opposite direction] It's coming the other way! [the Marshes stop, then run back the way they came]"
90,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Go back, go back!!"
91,9,8,Stephen Stotch,Everyone into the community center! Hurry! Go!
92,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[arrives to lend a hand] Get inside! We have to close these doors! [everyone for miles around comes and fills up the center. Again, the Global Warming camera focuses on the entrance and floats its way towards it. The last two people around, Stephen and Randy, close the doors just before the camera gets there.]"
93,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Come on, we've got to board up that last window! Seal off all the doorways! We must try to protect ourselves from the global warming."
94,9,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, are you all right?"
95,9,8,Mrs Garrison,I'm in pretty bad shape. My... leg is broken and my... left boob is leaking
96,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"[arrives with a blanket to wrap around Stan, who has a cot to sleep in, and is seated on it] Here you go, sweetheart."
97,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Mom, you know, those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood."
98,9,8,Sharon Marsh,"I know, but, I'm afraid it's too late for them, sweetie. We have to try and save ourselves now."
99,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Shh, shh! We've got the television working! [one of two TVs in front of the crowd comes to life]"
100,9,8,Announcer,This is a FOX News update! Global Warming Disaster!
101,9,8,Anchor,"Global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the Colorado Rockies! All around the country, panic and chaos are settling in!"
102,9,8,Field Reporter Mitch,"Tom, I am standing just outside of Chicago, where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths. Already we're reporting that the death toll here in Chicago is over 600 billion people"
103,9,8,Officer Barbrady,Oh God.
104,9,8,Stephen Stotch,"[turns around in anger] This is all your fault, Jimbo!"
105,9,8,Jimbo Kern,Me??
106,9,8,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah! You drive that damn SUV around! You didn't even think about global warming, DIDJA?!"
107,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[with a cup of water, approaches Stan] Can you believe it, Stan? I never thought global warming could happen so fast. I guess... I didn't listen."
108,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it... it isn't global warming."
109,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
110,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[hops off his cot] Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood."
111,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,How do you know that?
112,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Because, I know what did cause the flood."
113,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,George Bush?
114,9,8,Stan Marsh,No.
115,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Terrorists?
116,9,8,Stan Marsh,No.
117,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Communists?
118,9,8,Stan Marsh,No.
119,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Chinese radicals?
120,9,8,Stan Marsh,No.
121,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,...Cartman?
122,9,8,Stan Marsh,...sort of.
123,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,[throws down his cup] Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
124,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[pulls him aside to a more private area] Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam."
125,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinks a bit] Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now."
126,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[arrives] Hey Stan. [studies Stan and Kyle's faces] Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!"
127,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside."
128,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!"
129,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves."
130,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,How?
131,9,8,Eric Cartman,Why?
132,9,8,Stan Marsh,"We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it."
133,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[addressing the crowd] Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!"
134,9,8,Mrs Garrison,"But... we need supplies, food, silicone."
135,9,8,Randy Marsh,"You go outside, and you'll die! By now, the global warming has... shifted the climate, [steps up to a laptop and presses a key. A rotating graph appears, with the graph line dipping low] bringing on a new ice age. Within the hour, the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero!"
136,9,8,Stephen Stotch,Jesus.
137,9,8,Randy Marsh,"All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can."
138,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,And... the rest of the country?
139,9,8,Randy Marsh,"[sighs as he moves from the laptop to the blackboard and pulls out a marker] Everyone below this line [draws a line from the border of Colorado and New Mexico to West Virginia] will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line [draws a line from the border of Colorado and Montana to Lake Erie] is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out. [draws two lines connecting the two longer lines, around Indiana] The balmy southwestern states [draws an open circle around Arizona, most of New Mexico, California and Nevada] might have a chance but, New York [draws a short line around it] will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast. [the crowd looks at it for a long time, then a man puts his hand to his mouth and starts chuckling] What, Frank?! [Frank points at the inadvertent phallus Randy drew on the map. Randy looks and realizes what he did] Aw awww, Goddammit! [goes to scribble all over the map so the dong isn't so noticeable.]"
140,9,8,Resident 1,"Hello? Anybody? We'd like to be rescued, please. Any day now."
141,9,8,Resident 2,Why haven't they come for us?
142,9,8,Resident 1,I... I don't know.
143,9,8,Resident 3,"Wait, look! Here comes a boat!"
144,9,8,Resident 2,Really? Oh! It's about time!
145,9,8,Wife,"Oh Kevin, we're saved! [buries her face in his shoulder]"
146,9,8,Resident 3,It looks like... three little boys.
147,9,8,Resident 1,"Hey, we'll take it! [they all start waving their arms] Over here, yes! Thank you! Thank you! [the boys appear, going backwards and screaming. They head for Beaverton Oil, a refinery nearby, and crash into it. The boys fall out of the boat and into the water, then pop up right away. Oil begins to pour out of pipes the boat broke upon crashing, and fire follows the oil. The oil slick rushes past the flooded homes, with fire riding it, and a wall of flames rises up] Oh, thanks. Thanks. That's a LOT better."
148,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,We can't get out! The flames are too big!
149,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and heads towards Stan] Oh great! You see, Stan?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle! [Kyle turns and looks at him] ""Oh, you've gotta help those people. It's your responsibility."""
150,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks towards Stan] Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! [Stan looks down, unsure what to do]"
151,9,8,Randy Marsh,Stan?? Stan!!
152,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,Randy! We've looked everywhere! Kyle's missing too!
153,9,8,Sharon Marsh,Oh my God! Where would they go?!
154,9,8,Stephen Stotch,"[on the public phone] Randy, Randy! Your son's on the phone!"
155,9,8,Randy Marsh,[gets to the phone and takes the receiver from Stephen] Stan??
156,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hey Dad."
157,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you're alive!"
158,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!"
159,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!"
160,9,8,Stan Marsh,"No, Dad, listen: I need to tell you something."
161,9,8,Randy Marsh,"What is it, son?"
162,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?"
163,9,8,Randy Marsh,"You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! [hangs up the phone and struggles with his emotions, then grabs his coat and scarf and bundles up]"
164,9,8,Mr Mackey,"Randy, wheh-where are you going?"
165,9,8,Randy Marsh,I'm going to Beaverton.
166,9,8,Anchorman Tom Pusslicker,[Craig's father] You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
167,9,8,Randy Marsh,My son is counting on me!
168,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,I'm going with you.
169,9,8,Randy Marsh,You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
170,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,You can't do this alone!
171,9,8,Stephen Stotch,Let me go too.
172,9,8,Man 12,You can't go out there. You'll freeze to death.
173,9,8,Randy Marsh,"All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find."
174,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Stephen! [Stephen mumbles but can't get up] Stephen, you have to keep moving!"
175,9,8,Stephen Stotch,I can't go on! Feel so... hot.
176,9,8,Randy Marsh,Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
177,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,Oh Jesus... [looking woozy] I feel warm too!
178,9,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, me too. [walks around Gerald] Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! [bends down to help Stephen up]"
179,9,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Maybe we should... strip these jackets off, and warm our bodies next to each other!"
180,9,8,Randy Marsh,Don't be a fag! [turns around] Come on! We can make it! [the men move forward again] We have to try!
181,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,"Come on, people, we're running out of time! We need all Army helicopters to the Southern states for evacuation NOW!"
182,9,8,Officer Barbrady,Sir! More people in Beaverton are calling. They say they're trapped in floods and fire now.
183,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,"Tell them that the government can't help them, but that we're very sorry. You know the plan, people! We can only evacuate citizens below this line! [the very line Randy mentioned]"
184,9,8,Scientist,"E-excuse me, General?"
185,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,WHAT??
186,9,8,Scientist,"We've just compiled some new information. The er, the flood in Beaverton wasn't caused by global warming after all."
187,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,What??
188,9,8,Scientist,We know the truth now. We know what caused it! [hands the general a photo. The general looks at it and his eyes grow big]
189,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,Oh my God. Quick! Radio the helicopters!
190,9,8,Eric Cartman,Help! Help! [a large drum falls from the ceiling in front of Kyle]
191,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!"
192,9,8,Stan Marsh,We have to find a way out! [the boys start climbing the metal stairs]
193,9,8,Pentagon General and soldiers,"[through his bullhorn] Don't worry, everyone. The government is here to save you. [the helicopters hover above the homes and drop rope ladders down]"
194,9,8,Resident 1,"Oh wow, thank you so much! What a swift and speedy rescue!"
195,9,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! [another drom falls near Kyle, shearing off the stairs they just climbed. Kyle falls on his ass and gets up]"
196,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh Jesus, we have to hurry!"
197,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[stops before an opening in the wall, where he sees sky and...] It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! [Kyle and Cartman are on a landing below. Kyle tries to catch up to Stan, but Cartman blocks his way]"
198,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Not so fast, Kyle."
199,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,What are you doing?
200,9,8,Eric Cartman,Hand over the gold!
201,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,What gold??
202,9,8,Eric Cartman,You know what I'm talkng about!
203,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!"
204,9,8,Eric Cartman,All Jews carry gold in a little bag around their necks! Hand it over!
205,9,8,Stan Marsh,"[drops down a few steps and calls] Guys, come on! [goes back up the stairs]"
206,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
207,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[pulls out a 9 mm handgun, hopefully fake.] I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!"
208,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!"
209,9,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!"
210,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit, you know I don't carry gold in a little bag around my neck, Cartman! Whattaya want from me?!"
211,9,8,Eric Cartman,"I want... your Jew gold! [Kyle has run out of things to say and stands there. Cartman glowers at him, ready to fire the gun if he moves]"
212,9,8,Kyle Broflovski,"...Okay, fine! Here! [opens his coat and pulls out a small black bag, and hands it to Cartman] Now let's go!"
213,9,8,Eric Cartman,"[moves the bag around for heaviness] Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!! [Kyle, angered at this delaying tactic, pulls out another small bag from under his coat and walks over to Cartman. Cartman laughs evilly as Kyle approaches. Kyle smiles an evil smile back and tosses the second bag over his shoulder and into the fire below.
