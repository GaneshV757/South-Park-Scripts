0,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go! [moves to the foot of the bed] MOM, GET UP!"
1,9,4,Liane Cartman,"[sits up, feeling sleepy] Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early."
2,9,4,Eric Cartman,"[goes to the other side of the bed and draws close to her face] Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one! [turns on her light] Come on! [goes back to the door]"
3,9,4,Liane Cartman,"[still sleepy] Sweetie, can't we go after school?"
4,9,4,Eric Cartman,Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
5,9,4,Eric Cartman,I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry! [they pull up to the curb and stop. Cartman gets out of the car] WHAT THE HELL?!
6,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, when did you get here?"
7,9,4,Kenny McCormick,[looks at his watch](Friday)
8,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Friday?! Aw, Jesus! [he switches tactics] I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. [gets in line between Kenny and the Goth Kids]"
9,9,4,Tall Goth,Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing?
10,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line."
11,9,4,Sixth Grader,"There's no saving place, fourthie! Get to the back or we'll beat your face in!"
12,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Goddammit! [moves to the back of the line] They'd better not sell out!"
13,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
14,9,4,Stan Marsh,"[answering for Kenny] It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan. [Cartman walks up to the other boys, but he's quite upset. He crosses his arms] Dude, you see what Kenny got?"
15,9,4,Eric Cartman,"YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE! [Cartman folds his arms]"
16,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Wuh what'd I do?
17,9,4,Eric Cartman,JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!!!
18,9,4,Game Voice,"""Congratulations! You have reached ...level nine!"""
19,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell."""
20,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at."
21,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing? [Yep] Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!"
22,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(I could get to level sixty!)
23,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"Who cares if you almost made it to level sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You're gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!"
24,9,4,Stuart McCormick,"[offscreen] Hey, I heard that, bitch!"
25,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!! [Kenny leaves, having tuned her out all the while]"
26,9,4,Stuart McCormick,[offscreen] How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!
27,9,4,Mrs McCormick,I'd like to see you try!
28,9,4,Stuart McCormick,"Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!"
29,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"It's my house too, you no-good loser!"
30,9,4,Game Voice,You have reached level sixty!
31,9,4,Kenny McCormick,"[starts jumping around excited] (Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) [an ice-cream truck runs over him. The driver misses this, as he's playing on his own PSP]"
32,9,4,Driver,"Oh yeah, level four, sweet!"
33,9,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, that's odd.) [He rises up in the air.] (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) [he then speaks too fast to decipher, but he toes towards heaven.]"
34,9,4,Angel 1,Open the gate!
35,9,4,Angel 2,Open the gate! [the gates open and an elderly man walks towards Kenny. Kenny shields his eyes from the bright rays.]
36,9,4,Peter,"Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter."
37,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(What the fuck is going on?)
38,9,4,Peter,"There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you."
39,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(Me?)
40,9,4,Peter,"Come! There is much to discuss. [they both enter and behold a gleaming city on a hill. Inside, the city has all the appearance of a super-basilica, built with gold and marble. Angels flit around doing stuff] Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven. [they pass the Mormons, who greet them] But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command."
41,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(That I what?)
42,9,4,Peter,"The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe."
43,9,4,Angel 3,"Satan's army grows as we speak. The Dark Lord knows that our armies are few in number, and unorganized. So our only hope... is perfect strategy. [steps aside to show Kenny off]"
44,9,4,Angel 4,A child? This is God's solution?
45,9,4,Peter,He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations.
46,9,4,Angel 4,"Archangel Michael, what say you?"
47,9,4,Archangel Michael,"[looks out into space, then turns around] The child did something none of us could: Reach level sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverance, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against. [two other angels roll a chalkboard to him, and he begins drawing up strategies.] This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more. [sniffs the fumes from the Sharpie] Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong. [sniffs again] We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can single handedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves. [Kenny just sits there.]"
48,9,4,Satan,My fellow damned souls! Now is the time for our assault! [with him is a small hooded figure] You know no fear! You will drink the blood of angels! We go now! Nothing can stop us!
49,9,4,Angel 5,"Step aside! Step aside, I say! [stops when he sees Satan] Satan! God has mocked thee once again!"
50,9,4,Satan,My spy!
51,9,4,Angel 5,God has found a way to defeat your army.
52,9,4,Satan,Impossible! How?!
53,9,4,Angel 5,"A young man. Basically, he-he's like Keanu Reeves."
54,9,4,Satan,[slumps down in his throne] Oh Jesus Christ.
55,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now!"
56,9,4,Satan,What's the point?! They have a Keanu Reeves now.
57,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","Do not fear, my Lord. Your army is great!"
58,9,4,Satan,"Very well. [rises and addresses his army] Demon Army, begin your march on Heaven! [a loud roar comes up from the army]"
59,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven."
60,9,4,Kenny McCormick,(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)
61,9,4,Angel 6,Simple. You will use... this. [bows towards a chair and backs off. A golden PSP descends onto the chair]
62,9,4,Archangel Michael,[gets the PSP and shows it to Kenny] This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.
63,9,4,Angels,Hail the holy PSP.
64,9,4,Archangel Michael,"It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals."
65,9,4,Angel 7,Gabriel returns with news!
66,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven.
67,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Prepare the troops! [the angels take off] We must be ready for them! [walks up to Kenny] The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands. [Kenny vanishes. The angels notice] Where'd he go?"
68,9,4,Female Nurse,"Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!"
69,9,4,The Doctor,Then that's it! We brought him back.
70,9,4,Male Nurse,"Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day!"
71,9,4,The Doctor,Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive.
72,9,4,The Doctor,It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again.
73,9,4,Stuart McCormick,"It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive."
74,9,4,The Doctor,"I'm afraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a ""persistent vegetative state."""
75,9,4,Mrs McCormick,Will he ever recover?
76,9,4,The Doctor,"I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaired once dead. But his soul is still in here. [places his hand on Kenny's chest] Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato."
77,9,4,Stuart McCormick,He can't more on his own-ah how will he eat?
78,9,4,The Doctor,A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomach. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years.
79,9,4,Archangel Michael,[reading a scroll] A feeding tube?!
80,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive.
81,9,4,Archangel Michael,But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!
82,9,4,Angel 3,The child's soul is now trapped inside his vegetative body. We have no one to command the troops with the PSP.
83,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,And Satan's armies are approaching.
84,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Oh, Goddammit."
85,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice. [the boys are shocked]
86,9,4,Stan Marsh,Are we in trouble or something?
87,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"No. Boys, I'm a lawyer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will."
88,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny had a will?
89,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"[clears his throat] ""In the highly likely event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have."""
90,9,4,Stan Marsh,Oh wow...
91,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's... really touching.
92,9,4,Eric Cartman,(looking bored) Fags!
93,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"To Eric Cartman: ""Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP."""
94,9,4,Eric Cartman,"[suddenly excited and cocky] Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?"
95,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,... [Cartman is still dancing. The lawyer reaches the last page and... can't fine it]"
96,9,4,Stan Marsh,Please what?
97,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,I don't know. I lost the last page.
98,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Who cares? Kenny's dead! [rushes up to the lawyer's desk] When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?"
99,9,4,Kenny's Lawyer,"[pulls up a box from nowhere and puts it on his desk] It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours."
100,9,4,Eric Cartman,[salivating] Yes!
101,9,4,Man,[enters the office] He's alive!
102,9,4,Stan Marsh,What?
103,9,4,Man,Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital! [leaves]
104,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God! [he and Stan rush out of there, leaving Cartman incredulous]"
105,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","Your army nears the Kingdom of Heaven, my Lord."
106,9,4,Satan,I don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has.
107,9,4,Spy Angel,Satan! I come bearing good news! The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven.
108,9,4,Satan,"[whispers] Then God is helpless. [aloud] Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!"
109,9,4,Stan Marsh,Kenny?
110,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! You're alive!
111,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, how'd you do that?"
112,9,4,The Doctor,"He can't respond to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain."
113,9,4,Eric Cartman,Well... well then he's NOT alive.
114,9,4,Mrs McCormick,He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...
115,9,4,Eric Cartman,"That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look. [climbs onto Kenny's bed and holds out a $1 bill] Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?"
116,9,4,Stuart McCormick,I-I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I-I just... I don't know what he would want.
117,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, the lawyer lost that page."
118,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube."
119,9,4,Mrs McCormick,He did? When?
120,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Um, it was um, this one time..."
121,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!
122,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Stupid? PSP is stupid?! [steps forth] Did you all hear that? [steps back to his little group] Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!"
123,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,He did not!
124,9,4,Eric Cartman,Did so!
125,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Did not!
126,9,4,Eric Cartman,"Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew! [moves towards the door] I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! [runs out]"
127,9,4,Peter,Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!
128,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP.
129,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel",No! There is another. A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine.
130,9,4,Archangel Michael,"[thinks for a moment] Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls!"
131,9,4,Angel 9,Yeah
132,9,4,Angel 1,Yeah
133,9,4,Angel 11,Yeah
134,9,4,Angel 12,"Yeah, Uriel!"
135,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","Oh, right right, I'm sorry"
136,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do. [walks up to the chalkboard and starts writing] Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime [sniffs those Sharpie fumes] we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Army from breaking through as long as possible. [sniffs those Sharpie fumes] Hopefully, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back."
137,9,4,Eric Cartman,"You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right."
138,9,4,Chief Justice,"Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here."
139,9,4,Eric Cartman,"I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF."
140,9,4,Judge 2,Best friends forever?
141,9,4,Eric Cartman,"That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look. [brings forth a necklace with the left half of a BFF heart medallion] Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is."
142,9,4,Mrs McCormick,"Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again."
143,9,4,The Doctor,[entering with a policeman] But this just doesn't seem right.
144,9,4,Stuart McCormick,"Wha, what's the matter, doctor?"
145,9,4,The Doctor,I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube.
146,9,4,Mrs McCormick,What?
147,9,4,Eric Cartman,[comes in with the Chief Justice] He's right in here.
148,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
149,9,4,Chief Justice,Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish.
150,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
151,9,4,Police Officer,"Sir, take a look at this. [has Kenny's necklace in hand and points to the other half of the BFF medallion. the justice walks over the officer puts the two halves together]"
152,9,4,Chief Justice,"[steps back] That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor."
153,9,4,Mrs McCormick,No doctor! You can't!
154,9,4,The Doctor,I'm sorry. I have no choice. [pulls the tube and drops it on the floor]
155,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Here is the hospital
156,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","[the blonde angel without a shirt] This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed?"
157,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,[exiting the hospital with Stan] That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
158,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! [they walk through the angels, then the angels turn around]"
159,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,The tube has been removed?
160,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
161,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us."
162,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time.
163,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!"
164,9,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
165,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,No!
166,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny."
167,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, come on! [grabs Kyle and they go away]"
168,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","No! No, no boys! Aw Goddammit! [the angels follow]"
169,9,4,HBC Anchor,"This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate is heating up in Colorado, [Kenny is shown] where Kenny McCormick's feeding tube has been removed by his BFF. [a choked-up Cartman shows his half of the BFF medallion] Two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital."
170,9,4,Stan Marsh,Don't kill Kenny!
171,9,4,All,You bastards!
172,9,4,Stan Marsh,Don't kill Kenny!
173,9,4,All,You bastards!
174,9,4,"Angels:
Archangel Michael
Archangel Gabriel
Archangel Uriel","[drifting through the crowd] No! No, they're not killing him, they're letting him die!"
175,9,4,Skeeter,You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!
176,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,"Nono, see, they were playing God when they put the feeding tube IN!"
177,9,4,HBC Anchor,A woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient. [Two officers haul Mrs. Garrison out of the emergency room]
178,9,4,Mrs Garrison,Get your man-hands off of me!
179,9,4,HBC Anchor,"However, a growing number of people are also standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman."
180,9,4,Man 1,"[in a crowd of people wearing BFF chains] We must respect the wishes of people's BFFs. Otherwise, all our BFF necklaces would become meaningless"
181,9,4,Man 2,"We all have BFFs, and we believe that a BFF is the highest legal authority."
182,9,4,Eric Cartman,That's right. Respect our authoritah.
183,9,4,Satan,What mockery is this?!
184,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",My Lord...
185,9,4,Satan,"The feeding tube has been pulled! If the child dies and his soul returns to Heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves!"
186,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",Perhaps the child won't die in time.
187,9,4,Satan,Forget it! I'm calling the attack off!
188,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","No! Keep your army marching, my Lord. I will get that feeding tube put back in. [turns and walks off]"
189,9,4,Satan,How?
190,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans.
191,9,4,George Bush,We Republicans are deeply saddened by the tragic events in Colorado. [the crowd cheers]
192,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","[appears and whispers into Bush's right ear] Removing the feeding tube is murder, hughughughughughugh..."
193,9,4,George Bush,Removing the feeding tube is murder!
194,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",[whispers into Bush's left ear] Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?
195,9,4,George Bush,Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?
196,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure",[whispers into Bush's right ear] It is God's will that he live!
197,9,4,George Bush,It is God's will that he LIVE! [the hooded figure hisses into Bush's left ear] Haaghaghaghaghaghagha...
198,9,4,"Kevin, the Hooded Figure","No no, you don't say that part. [hisses into Bush's right ear]"
199,9,4,George Bush,"No no, you don't say that part, haghaghaghagha. [the crowd looks at him in stunned silence]"
200,9,4,Angel 9,"Jesus, their army is massive."
201,9,4,Angel 1,Heaven help us.
202,9,4,HBC Anchor,The biggest battle of all time is about to begin: the battle of the feeding tube! As people on both sides of the argument vie for media attention.
203,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!"
204,9,4,Eric Cartman,I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
205,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You say tomato, but I say Kenny!"
206,9,4,Eric Cartman,"You say Kenny, but I say tomato! [both sides yell at each other]"
207,9,4,Cartman s Side,Tomato!
208,9,4,Kyle s Side,Kenny! Kenny!
209,9,4,Cartman s Side,Tomato!
210,9,4,Judge,"[The executioner of Kenny's will] Uuhh, excuse me. I uh, just found the last page of Kenny's will. [Everyone quiets down]"
211,9,4,Eric Cartman,What?
212,9,4,Judge,I found the page where Kenny specified his wishes about being on life support.
213,9,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, what does it say?"
214,9,4,Judge,"[clears his throat] If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life support, please... [flips to the last page] for the love of God, don't ever show me in that condition on national television. [not a word is uttered for a few seconds]"
215,9,4,Stan Marsh,Oooo.
216,9,4,Man,Oowhoops
217,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh geez. Maybe we let this thing get out of hand. This issue is so complicated, but... m-maybe we sh-should just let Kenny go in peace."
218,9,4,Stan Marsh,"You mean, Cartman's side is right?"
219,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons."
220,9,4,Both sides,Yeah.
221,9,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. [everyone walks out.]"
222,9,4,HBC Anchor,"We've just received word that Kenny McCormick... has passed away. The debate still rages on in America, but at least now, Kenny... is in a much more peaceful place."
223,9,4,Angel 11,The armies of Satan have already broken through the gate!
224,9,4,Angel 12,We're gonna die!!!
225,9,4,Archangel Michael,Send our troops to the battlefield! I'll command as best I can!
226,9,4,Archangel Gabriel,Michael! Michael! [he and Uriel bring Kenny to Michael] The humans finally did the right thing!
227,9,4,Archangel Michael,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! Get him into the command station! Hurry! [Uriel and Gabriel sit Kenny down and strap him in] Satan's army charges! Tell our troops what to do, Kenny! [Kenny sets to work on the Golden PSP, manning the controls like a pro] So it begins. [Gabriel and Uriel leave Kenny to his task and fly off. The camera focuses on Michael] Now we shall see the final battle between Heaven and Hell play out! [Kenny continues playing, and Michael provides commentary] Yesss, good, Kenny!
