0,9,3,Mrs Garrison,"Children, children, we have a very special announcement. [shown with Token at his side] Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing! Well let's give him a hand! [he claps, and Butters, Annie, and Bebe join him]"
1,9,3,Stan Marsh,Token sings?
2,9,3,Eric Cartman,Of course he sings. He's black.
3,9,3,Mrs Garrison,Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver. And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars.
4,9,3,Class,Whoa!
5,9,3,Stan Marsh,Two hundred dollars.
6,9,3,Mrs Garrison,"Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special."
7,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?"
8,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,How come we never get opportunities like that?
9,9,3,Eric Cartman,"You wanna know what it is, guys?"
10,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,We're not talented?
11,9,3,Eric Cartman,"That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side."
12,9,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.
13,9,3,Eric Cartman,"[leaves the table] Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star."
14,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Probably.
15,9,3,Eric Cartman,"So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!"
16,9,3,Stan Marsh,Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
17,9,3,Eric Cartman,"We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. [strokes his chin]"
18,9,3,Stan Marsh,He's looking at the sign.
19,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there."
20,9,3,Stan Marsh,All right.
21,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk."
22,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
23,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit."
24,9,3,Stan Marsh,It's genius.
25,9,3,Eric Cartman,"[motioning them away] Okay, go go, here he comes. [they leave, and he walks into Token's field of view talking into his cell phone] Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested. [stops just before they collide] Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!"
26,9,3,Token Black,Nothin'
27,9,3,Eric Cartman,"[puts his phone away] Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night."
28,9,3,Token Black,Yeah.
29,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you."
30,9,3,Token Black,I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
31,9,3,Eric Cartman,This will only take a second.
32,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm? [they look at the fountains for a few moments, then Cartman turns Token around] Come on over this way, Token. [the other boys come to greet Token] Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client."
33,9,3,Stan Marsh,"[sitting Token down on the sofa] Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man."
34,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?"
35,9,3,Token Black,[Stan and Kyle walk off...] ...Yeah?
36,9,3,Eric Cartman,"[...and reappear on either side of him] Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of. [his phone rings] Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token. [takes the ""call""] Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln? [Token just looks on. Kyle is stunned that Cartman would mention Lincoln, then gets cross about it] Yeah, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now."
37,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Can I talk to you?! [grabs Cartman's shoulder]
38,9,3,Eric Cartman,"I'll I'll call you back, Abe. [hangs up. Kyle pulls him behind the partition]"
39,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell are you doing?!
40,9,3,Eric Cartman,I'm making it look like important people call us.
41,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
42,9,3,Eric Cartman,[thinks for a moment] ...well Token doesn't know that.
43,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yes he does!
44,9,3,Eric Cartman,How?!
45,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!"
46,9,3,Eric Cartman,Jew! [Stan comes around the corner]
47,9,3,Stan Marsh,"You guys, we're gonna lose our client. [the boys come into view again]"
48,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that. [goes to his desk and clears his throat. Stan and Kyle flank him again] Ah, now, where were we?"
49,9,3,Token Black,We were at why I should give you ten percent.
50,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can."
51,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you."
52,9,3,Stan Marsh,"This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token. With our support, you can have the whole pie."
53,9,3,Token Black,"[thinks a moment] Well, I guess that makes sense. All right. [the boys are a bit stunned at how brief and easy this was]"
54,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? [slides the contract towards Token, and Token signs it]"
55,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Welcome to the team, Token."
56,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!"
57,9,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, terrific!)"
58,9,3,Eric Cartman,"From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us."
59,9,3,Miss Colorado Pageant MC,"And there are your finalists, the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado. Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists, the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest, Token Black. [a soul beat comes up and Token walks onto the stage. The crowd cheers him on, he hits his mark and begins to sing]"
60,9,3,Token Black,You'll never find...As long as you live...Someone who loves you...Tender like I do...
61,9,3,Man in Audience,"[""You'll never find...""] Wow, he's really great. We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah [""No matter where you search...""]"
62,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?"
63,9,3,Eric Cartman,"We represent Token. [hands the man a business card] Give us a call, we'll work out a deal."
64,9,3,Token Black,"Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, babyBut I'm the one who loves youAnd there's no one else! No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh one else."
65,9,3,Mrs Garrison,"Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing."
66,9,3,Principal Victoria,"[winces] Mr. Garrison, for the love of God."
67,9,3,Token Black,"... (you're gonna miss my lovin')I know you're gonna my lovin' (you're gonna miss my lovin')You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my lo-o-ove."
68,9,3,Stan Marsh,"You were awesome, Token!"
69,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,We knew you could do it!
70,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great! And ten percent of two hundred is..."
71,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Twenty dollars.
72,9,3,Token Black,Here you go. [hands Cartman $20]
73,9,3,Kenny McCormick,(All right!)
74,9,3,Eric Cartman,Sweet!
75,9,3,Stan Marsh,This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
76,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","[walks up to the boys] Hey there my man, that was a great performance."
77,9,3,Token Black,Thanks.
78,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles. I think you've got real promise. How'd you like to sign with CAA?"
79,9,3,Token Black,Are you serious?
80,9,3,Stan Marsh,"[interjecting] Uh excuse me, Token already has representation."
81,9,3,Eric Cartman,You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
82,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Mm, no. Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away. If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through."
83,9,3,Token Black,Oh my God! Okay!
84,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Token, you signed with us!"
85,9,3,Token Black,"Oh, come on, guys. You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me."
86,9,3,Eric Cartman,What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
87,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Actually, our fountain is two stories tall."
88,9,3,Eric Cartman,...Oooo...
89,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about."
90,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Mister, you can't do this to us!"
91,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know? [Token goes into the limo and takes a seat. Don follows him in] Do you like steak, Token? I know a great place for you locally. [the limo rolls off]"
92,9,3,Eric Cartman,...Goddamnit! [throws down the $20 bill]
93,9,3,Stan Marsh,So unfair... so unfair.
94,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
95,9,3,Eric Cartman,"This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! [Tuong Li Kim comes into view, climbing down the stairs]"
96,9,3,Mr Kim,"Ahh hello, is this the Talent Agency"
97,9,3,Stan Marsh,Huh?
98,9,3,Mr Kim,"I see this sign on the street for a talent agency? I need a representation. [the boys all perk up and look at Lu Kim, then jump at the chance to get a new client] Hey, wowee, nice fountain."
99,9,3,Stan Marsh,You were looking for a talent agent?
100,9,3,Mr Kim,"No, not me, my wife. [calls her down the stairs. She dutifully appears] This is Wing. She just come over from China. [puts his right hand on to the left side of his face so she doesn't hear] She over here uh irregarry. The Chinese Mafia help me out."
101,9,3,Stan Marsh,And what does she do?
102,9,3,Mr Kim,"Ah, she sing. She very popular in China. Hey, you just sit and listen. You'll be very impressed. [he barks commands at her, then goes over to a tape player, puts a tape in, and waits for Wing to sing. The boys take seats at a row of chairs nearby. Wing begins a bad rendition of ABBA's Dancing Queen] Well? What you think?"
103,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us."
104,9,3,Mr Kim,"Aww, that's too bad. She just got accepted to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres, but I can't take her 'cause I have to mind the restaurant. [the boys think, then blink]"
105,9,3,Eric Cartman,You've ...already done all the work?
106,9,3,Mr Kim,Yes. They say it pays a thousand dowar.
107,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Sir, we would love to sign your wife."
108,9,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
109,9,3,Mr Kim,Rearry?
110,9,3,Eric Cartman,"We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. [Wing continues singing]"
111,9,3,Mr Kim,"Shitty Wok, take your order prease."
112,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?"
113,9,3,Mr Kim,"Oh, don't worry about her. She a very dericate little flower. See, she don't need to eat much."
114,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV."
115,9,3,Mr Kim,"Okay, bye. Oh oh wait! Can I talk to my wife, please?"
116,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh sure, here she is. [Stan puts the phone to Wing's ear, and Mr. Kim begins barking at her again] Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family. [outside there's a flash of light and three shadows pass through the doors] Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease? [the men come into the light. They are three buff Chinese men] Aw crap, Chinese Mafia! [one of the men walks around behind the counter, grabs Mr. Kim's head with one hand and places a knife against his chin with the other] Aaaaahh! [the two men move around to the eating area and are met by four other Tong members]"
117,9,3,Tong Leader,"Mr. Ru Kim, it appears we have a problem."
118,9,3,Mr Kim,"Oh, a problem? Rearry?"
119,9,3,Tong Leader,"We smuggled your wife into the United States for you. You were to pay us ten thousand dollars for that service. Yet, we have yet to be paid."
120,9,3,Mr Kim,"We... we working on it! She, she got tarent agent! She's about to make a whole lotta money!"
121,9,3,Tong Leader,"It's too late for that, Mr. Kim. Your wife is now our property. We taking her to Los Angeles, where she will work in massage parlor.until she works off the debt."
122,9,3,Mr Kim,"No, she... she not here! Prease, just give me a little more time! [the leader punches him in the face] Agh!"
123,9,3,Tong Leader,Where is she?!
124,9,3,Mr Kim,She... she in Arabama.
125,9,3,Tong Leader,You're lying. Turn him around!
126,9,3,Mr Kim,"Yah, wah, aaaah!"
127,9,3,Tong Leader,You don't wanna tell us where she is? All right. Puh la! Ching ga wai pan! [one of the men begins to grab trays of food and dumps the first one over the counter]
128,9,3,Mr Kim,"Ahhh! My shitty chicken! [the man grabs the next tray and dumps that over the counter] Nooo, the shitty beef! [the man grabs the next tray...] No! No wait! Prease! Stop! Prease! Not the shitty shrimp."
129,9,3,Tong Leader,"Tell us where to find her, Ru Kim! You have no choice."
130,9,3,Mr Kim,"She... she go to Ros Angeres with her agents! She gonna be American Idol. [the leader snaps his fingers, the other men let him go, and they all leave. Mr. Kim collapses on the floor sobbing]"
131,9,3,Stan Marsh,There it is! American Idol contestants!
132,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, we made it just in time! [the boys attempt to talk to the attendants]"
133,9,3,Eric Cartman,Excuse us!
134,9,3,Contestant,"Hey kid, what do you think you're doing? [the boys turn to face him]"
135,9,3,Stan Marsh,Ah our client has an audition to this show.
136,9,3,Contestant,Yeah. So do we! [the camera pulls back to show the long line of contestants waiting for their auditions]
137,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh crap!
138,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, how long is the wait?"
139,9,3,Contestant 2,It's been about seventeen days for me.
140,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, no no no, come on! [the boys return to the attendants] Excuse me, ma'am."
141,9,3,Attendant,Wait in line with everyone else. [turns away]
142,9,3,Stan Marsh,"No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. [the woman]"
143,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-"
144,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone. [clears his throat and whips out his phone] Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is."
145,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, just forget it! [hauls Cartman away. The other boys follow, but Wing doesn't]"
146,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders! You shouldn't give her any more chicken."
147,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
148,9,3,Stan Marsh,We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
149,9,3,Eric Cartman,Stupid assholes! [they pass an agent talking on a cell phone]
150,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent",What do you mean your client isn't coming?! We're taping the show tomorrow! Where am I goin' to find another contestant? Fine! Go screw yourself!
151,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?"
152,9,3,Stan Marsh,We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
153,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent",Really?
154,9,3,Eric Cartman,Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
155,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Well yeah, winner gets a thousand dollars."
156,9,3,Stan Marsh,"All right, our client will do it!"
157,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent",Great! You kids just saved my ass! See you over at Stage 6. [moves off.]
158,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?"
159,9,3,"Don Heisman, CAA Agent","Naw, this is better. It's called The Contender. [gets into a cart and drives off.]"
160,9,3,Stan Marsh,"What's ""The Contender""?"
161,9,3,Announcer,"Tonight, two people will compete for glory. One will stay, one will go home, in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone."
162,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,Hello.
163,9,3,Announcer,The Contender!
164,9,3,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender! Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico, Manuelo Furrrrnanda! [Furnanda dances and jabs at the air, then raises his arms. Mexican fans in the audience cheer him on]"
165,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,"[at ringside, slurred speech] Le's go! Le's see a good fight!"
166,9,3,Announcer,"And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!"
167,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Wing!"
168,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Let's do it Wing!
169,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Go Wing! [Kenny cheers on as well, but he's hard to understand. The bell rings. Wing's music comes up and she begins to sing ""Fernando"" as Fernanda sizes her up]"
170,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,Aw yeah! [Fernanda begins to deliver blows to Wing and the boys wince]
171,9,3,The Boys,Awww! [Fernanda delivers more blows]
172,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, dude!"
173,9,3,Eric Cartman,"She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. [Fernanda delivers more blows until Wing is knocked out and falls to the side]"
174,9,3,The Boys,[wincing] Awww! [Kenny draws his hood string tight around his face]
175,9,3,Eric Cartman,Gay.
176,9,3,Stan Marsh,Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
177,9,3,Eric Cartman,Your gift of hope is a great deduction. [no one stops to donate. Stallone and his producers come out and approach the boys]
178,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,Hey kid! [Stan and Cartman turn around and he mumbles at them]
179,9,3,Producer,Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
180,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, thanks."
181,9,3,Sylvester Stallone,Yo kid. [mumbles some more]
182,9,3,Producer,"Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent. [Stallone mumbles some more] He really likes her voice. [Stallone mumbles some more] You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, [Stallone mumbles some more] it brings tears to his eyes."
183,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. [Stallone mumbles some more]"
184,9,3,Producer,"Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding."
185,9,3,Stan Marsh,You do? [Stallone mumbles some more]
186,9,3,Producer,He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
187,9,3,Eric Cartman,Four thousand dollars? [Stallone mumbles some more and hands his producer a card]
188,9,3,Producer,[hands the card to Stan] Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.
189,9,3,Stan Marsh,"We won't! [Stallone mumbles some more, then leaves with his men]"
190,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Waaaaah! [they run over to Kyle and Kenny, who have their own cups]"
191,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Waaaaah! [they run over to Kyle and Kenny, who have their own cups]"
192,9,3,Stan Marsh,"You guys, you guys!"
193,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,What?
194,9,3,Stan Marsh,Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
195,9,3,Kenny McCormick,(What?!)
196,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Get out!
197,9,3,Eric Cartman,That's four hundred for us! We did it! [tosses his cup away]
198,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Woohoo! Yeah!
199,9,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
200,9,3,Eric Cartman,Who let the dogs out?
201,9,3,The Boys,[dancing in pairs] Who? Who? Who who?
202,9,3,Eric Cartman,Who let the dogs out?
203,9,3,The Boys,Who? Who? Who who?
204,9,3,Eric Cartman,Who let-?
205,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? [the joy leaves instantly]"
206,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
207,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Naw, sh-she was with you!"
208,9,3,Stan Marsh,"...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again."
209,9,3,Eric Cartman,[move forward] Wing? Wing?
210,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wing?
211,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Wing? Here, Wing!"
212,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wing?
213,9,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Wing?) [nearby, the Tong have arrived and abducted Wing]"
214,9,3,Tong Leader,"You thought you could run from us, did you? [the boys look around, and Stan spots her]"
215,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh no! [he points towards Wing, who's now being put into a limousine. The boys race over] Hey! That's our client! [the driver gets into the limo and drives off]"
216,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
217,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back."
218,9,3,Tong Leader,"[in one of the rooms] You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away. Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves. It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us. [guards outside the house arm themselves]"
219,9,3,Stan Marsh,"[walking up the driveway with his friends] Two four nine all right, this is the place."
220,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn, CAA is pretty impressive."
221,9,3,Eric Cartman,Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!
222,9,3,Guard 1,"[says something in Chinese. Translations follow] ""It's just four little boys"" [the second guard says something to the boys as they walk up the stairs and pass through the front doors]"
223,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls."
224,9,3,Stan Marsh,Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!
225,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys. Look! [they face a two-story-tall fountain with a curving stairway on each side] They do have an amazing fountain. [four guards appear and run down one of the staircases, getting into positions]"
226,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
227,9,3,Stan Marsh,"You tell 'em, Kyle!"
228,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! [the four guards open fire. the boys look for a place to hide and find shelter behind a counter.]"
229,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!"
230,9,3,Tong Leader,[hears the commotion nearby] What the hell is that?! Go! Go! [sends the guards with him out]
231,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, maybe we should give up!"
232,9,3,Stan Marsh,"No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!"
233,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! [leaves the counter]"
234,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman! [Cartman runs through the gunfire and makes it to a wall on which rest several guns. He takes one and cocks it. The four guards move down to the floor]
235,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Do you wanna play rough?! Okay! [comes out from behind the wall] Take this! [begins firing away. He has no control over the gun, so it fires everywhere. One of the guards is struck down, another one quickly goes up the stairs again]"
236,9,3,Stan Marsh,"We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! [Kyle and Kenny move away from the gunfire, Stan goes towards Cartman. Kyle and Kenny enter a blue room]"
237,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wing?
238,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,[pulls out a yellow toy car] Stupid talent agents!
239,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[stirs] All right, Kenny, let's go! [stops when nothing happens, then looks] Kenny? [the camera pulls back to show Kenny, shot up and bleeding, dead on the floor] Kenny! [walks over to Kenny with his arms open] Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing. [hugs Kenny, sobbing] We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!"
240,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,They killed Kenny!
241,9,3,Stan Marsh,You bastards!
242,9,3,Tong Leader,Enough! [comes into view with a gun to Wing's head] I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
243,9,3,Eric Cartman,Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
244,9,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!"
245,9,3,Tong Leader,This woman has a contract with us! We own her!
246,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,She had a contract with us first! We own her!
247,9,3,Tong Leader,Her life belongs to us!
248,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Her life belongs to us!
249,9,3,Stan Marsh,"[intervening] Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of."
250,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
251,9,3,Stan Marsh,Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
252,9,3,Tong Leader,"[releases his grip on Wing and lowers his gun] Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings."
253,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
254,9,3,Tong Leader,[sighs deeply and turns around] I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business.
255,9,3,Stan Marsh,It's a lousy business. I quit.
256,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
257,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw aw guys, come on!"
258,9,3,Tong Leader,"We quit too. [his guards lower their weapons] It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void."
259,9,3,Stan Marsh,All right!
260,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,All right!
261,9,3,Producer,"[interpreting] Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing! [cheers and applause as she takes the stage to sing ""Sing A Song""]"
262,9,3,"Wing Han Tsang, Special Guest Star","Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long..."
263,9,3,Mr Kim,"[seated at a table with the Tong leader and the boys] Boys, thank you so much for eveything. You rearry helped us out."
264,9,3,Tong Leader,"Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful. [""Don't worry if it's not good enough...""] To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing. [""...for anyone else to hear.""]"
265,9,3,Stan Marsh,"I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people. [""Just sing..."" Token appears in the background]"
266,9,3,Token Black,"Send a cress in your plates, folks? [""Sing a song...""]"
267,9,3,Kyle Broflovski,[notices] Token?
268,9,3,Token Black,"[notices] Oh... Hey guys. [walks up to the table] What, what are you doin' here?"
269,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Token, you're... waiting tables?"
270,9,3,Token Black,"Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you. [""Sing, sing a song""] I'm trying to work my way back home."
271,9,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! [""make it simple, to last your whole life long."" Token walks off ]"
272,9,3,Tong Leader,"My God, her voice is sooo beautiful! [""Don't worry if it's not good enough...""]"
273,9,3,Mr Kim,"Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower. [""for anyone else to hear."" gets up and screams at her]"
274,9,3,"Wing Han Tsang, Special Guest Star","Sing, sing a song."
