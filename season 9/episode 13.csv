0,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"And now, Jambu is going to going to give you all a big wave! [the whale rolls to the right and smacks one of its fins on the water, which splashes onto the audience. The crowd ooos and ahhs. A wave of water hits the boys, who are sitting in the front row.]"
1,9,13,Eric Cartman,I'm all wet! Sweet!
2,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, Jambu is the best! [Jambu returns and takes a quick dive towards the bottom of its tank.]"
3,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Now get ready for Jambu's next trick. [Jambu leaps up into the air, performs a somersault, and strikes the water with its fluke, again sending water onto the boys]"
4,9,13,Eric Cartman,Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
5,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[shown as a brunet, with long sideburns] How about that, folks! A full body flip! And now, Kelly's gonna show us how she makes Jambu do his tricks. [a blonde woman in a wet suit steps forward, kneels down by the edge of the small dock she's on, and strikes the water three times with her hand] When Kelly slaps her hand three times, Jambu comes to her. Jambu will stay and wait until Kelly gives him a command. [she signals for him to go forward, and she dives in after him] Oh, what trick are we gonna see? Get those cameras ready! [Kelly dives and gets into position. Jambu circles the tank, then returns and pops up out of the water with Kelly on his nose. She then waves her arms signaling she's fine.] That's Kelly riding on Jambu's nose! [aside, to his partner Mike in the booth] I wish Kelly would ride on my nose. [they both laugh. Jambu drops a bit and Kelly dives off his nose. Jambu splashes the crown once more.]"
6,9,13,Eric Cartman,Yes! Yeehehehes! [Jambu returns with Kelly on his nose as if she were a hood ornament]
7,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"We hope you enjoyed Jambu's orca show, and enjoy the rest of your day at Denver's Sea Park! [clicks off his mic] You bunch of retards. [Mike laughs. Everyone begins to clear the small stadium]"
8,9,13,Stan Marsh,"[reading the park map] Okay, where to next?"
9,9,13,Eric Cartman,I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
10,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
11,9,13,Eric Cartman,Why?
12,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, everyone's leaving! We can walk right up to the tank and really study him."
13,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?"
14,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show."
15,9,13,Eric Cartman,Killer. [the boys turn and leave]
16,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
17,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. [turns to catch up with Stan and Kenny. Kyle walks around the tank]"
18,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Jambu? Jambu? [taps the glass wall four times. Jambu dives and floats up facing Kyle] Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu."
19,9,13,Jambu,"Hello, little boy. [Stan is awed that the whale could talk] You like my flippers?"
20,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[a little scared, looks around] Who said that?"
21,9,13,Jambu,I did.
22,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,No way!
23,9,13,Jambu,"This is very exciting! Usually when I talk, nobody can hear me. Where are you from?"
24,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,[timidly] South Park.
25,9,13,Jambu,It sure is nice to have somebody to talk to. Can't we talk more? Please?
26,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,What do you wanna talk about?
27,9,13,Jambu,Let's talk about rocket ships.
28,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Rocket ships?
29,9,13,Jambu,"[it's actually Brian, still in his booth] Yeah. I love rockets, but I can't see them 'cause I'm stuck in this tank. [he and Mike both laugh, then he shushes Mike and returns to the mic]. You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship."
30,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Why? Aren't you happy here?
31,9,13,Jambu,"I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!"
32,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,This is amazing! But wait right here. I've gotta go tell my friends about this! [the two men in the booth are laughing their asses off]
33,9,13,Jambu,"Oh God, it's funny every single time. [Mike continues laughing]"
34,9,13,Stingray Announcer,"And for those of you just joining us, this is the stingray tank. Stingrays are members of the shark family, but they're extremely peaceful creatures. We invite you to gently touch the top of them as they swim by."
35,9,13,Eric Cartman,"[slapping the water as a stingray approaches] Heh! Come on, stingray! [it speeds away. Another one approaches] Splash me! Ha! Hey, splash me! [it speeds away as well] Dude, these things are dumb. Let's go!"
36,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,[running up to the other boys] Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
37,9,13,Stan Marsh,What?
38,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he talks! The orca whale talks!"
39,9,13,Kenny McCormick,(What the fuck are you talking about?)
40,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! [runs back towards Jambu's exhibit, grinning]"
41,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Jambu! Jambu, I'm back! [hits the wall four times, and Jambu swims around, stopping in front of Kyle again] How are you feeling? [no reply. A few seconds later...] Huhm. Jambu, you wanna talk about rocket ships? [Brian is playing a video game, Mike is reading a book - Mother Trucker.] Ja- Jambu? Are you still feelin' lonely here?"
42,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man."
43,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!"
44,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[noticing the commotion] Dude, he's back, he's back! [the two men get ready]"
45,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddammit, say something!"
46,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale."
47,9,13,Jambu,[Cartman stops in his tracks] Please don't call me stupid.
48,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?"
49,9,13,Jambu,"I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't talk. It's because I'm very very sick, you see."
50,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Sick?
51,9,13,Stan Marsh,I don't believe it.
52,9,13,Jambu,"Yes, because I'm not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I'm from the moon! [Brian clicks off his mic, Mike laughs, and they both crack up]"
53,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,The moon?
54,9,13,Jambu,"The... that's where all orca whales are from. If I don't get back to the moon, I'm going to die."
55,9,13,Eric Cartman,You live on the moon?
56,9,13,Jambu,I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.
57,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God...
58,9,13,Stan Marsh,Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
59,9,13,Jambu,"I can't tell them, because they're evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform."
60,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,That's terrible!
61,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Dude, dude, the boss is coming!"
62,9,13,Jambu,"Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can't talk anymore. I'm too sick. [coughs] Can't. Talk. Any. More. [coughs. The boys stand there, stunned]"
63,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,"
64,9,13,Butters Stotch,Well okay! Let's do it!
65,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work."
66,9,13,Clyde Donovan,...A whale. Talked to you.
67,9,13,Stan Marsh,It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
68,9,13,Craig Tucker,"Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking."
69,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?"
70,9,13,Craig Tucker,Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.
71,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
72,9,13,Craig Tucker,...So it's true.
73,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Nobody else is going to help him, you guys. We've got a chance to do something pretty special here. Are you with us?"
74,9,13,Token Black,...What do we do?
75,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Stan? [Stan rises and approaches the easel]
76,9,13,Stan Marsh,"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards."
77,9,13,Timmy Burch,"[softly] Timmihhhhh... [The guard looks back just after they pass by, so he just missed them. The boys reach Jambu's tank]"
78,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Craig, Token, get the slings ready. [Cartman, Clyde, and a third boy position a ladder into place. Jambu swims over to see what's happening.]"
79,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here."
80,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Dude, did you see that episode of Trading Spouses last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell? [people mill around by Jambu's tank. Police officers move about. The park's owner talks to the guard]"
81,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,"How could you not have seen anything?? It's a whale, for Christ's sake!"
82,9,13,Security Guard,It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.
83,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,Were you in there for three hours?!
84,9,13,Security Guard,"[hurt, turns away and shields himself] Don't yell at me! [Brianand Mike arrive from the booth]"
85,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,What happened?
86,9,13,Orca Trainer Kelly,"Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park."
87,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,What? How?
88,9,13,Security Guard,[raises his head up long enough to say] I DON'T KNOW!
89,9,13,Sergeant,"All right, people, it's obvious we're dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group. Those bastards have done stuff like this before."
90,9,13,Nelson,"Sir! Sir, we've found a note!"
91,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,A note? Let me see that. [reads the note] We're taking Willzy-x home to the moon. Long live the zypods! [the duo instantly realize who stole Jambu] What the hell does that mean?
92,9,13,Sergeant,"Harris, run a fingerprint on that note! [hands the note to Harris] Nelson! Find out what kind of crayon it was written with. [Nelson leaves] We'll find out who was responsible for this! [the duo know the jig is up]"
93,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,We have to tell them! We know what those boys look like!
94,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"We can't tell them, then they're, they're gonna think this is all our fault"
95,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,It IS all our fault!
96,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,How were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it?!
97,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"I shouldn't have laughed. All those times we've messed with those kids' heads, I shouldn't have just sat there and laughed."
98,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,[grabs him by the arms] Don't you say that! It was funny! It was really funny! We've just... [lets him go] we've just gotta make this right ourselves.
99,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,How?
100,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,We've gotta track down those kids. Before the police do!
101,9,13,Putin,"Comrades, I'm afraid our situation is dire. The economy is stale and I... Very soon, Mother Russia... will no longer be a country."
102,9,13,Aide,"Sir! Sir, somebody is on telephone! Another rich American wants to fly into space! [silence, then everyone rushes into Putin's office]"
103,9,13,Putin,"Hello? Hello, this is Russian President."
104,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money."
105,9,13,Putin,"Yes, we certainly do! [holds his left thumb up for the others to see] What were you looking for?"
106,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away."
107,9,13,Putin,"The moon. That is quite large trip, but I'm sure we can do it!"
108,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,You can? Awesome!
109,9,13,Putin,"It sounds like we're in business! We will just need, say, twenty million dollars?"
110,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,[lowers the phone with some disbelief] Twenty... million? [raises the phone to his ear again] Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
111,9,13,Putin,...What?
112,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
113,9,13,Putin,"Goddamnit it is prank call again! [his staff leaves] Kiss my ass, George Bush! This is not funny! [slams the phone onto the base]"
114,9,13,Stan Marsh,What happened?
115,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,They want twenty million dollars.
116,9,13,Eric Cartman,Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
117,9,13,Craig Tucker,That was it? That was you guys' whole plan? Ask the Russians to take the whale to space?
118,9,13,Stan Marsh,They were going to do it for that 'N Sync guy.
119,9,13,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, Jesus, now what are we gonna do?!"
120,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all."
121,9,13,Clyde Donovan,"Well we can't keep the whale out here anymore, people are gonna see it!"
122,9,13,News Anchor Tom and Field Reporter Chris,"A beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the Denver Sea Park. A full investigation is underway, but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one WHALE of a problem."
123,9,13,News Anchor Tom and Field Reporter Chris,"Thanks, Tom, I'm here at the Denver Sea Park where, believe it or not, dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale. [a crowd of protesters begin to chant]"
124,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"That's right. We are members of the Animal Liberation Front! Whales do not belong in tanks, they belong in the ocean! We applaud whoever did this noble deed! Set the whales free!"
125,9,13,Protesters,Set the whales free!
126,9,13,News Anchor Tom and Field Reporter Chris,One thing for certain: something is certainly FISHY here at the Sea Park. Tom?
127,9,13,News Anchor Tom and Field Reporter Chris,"Thank, Mitch. It seems that this problem is almost un-BEAR-able. [no one says a word] Let's hope that whale is found."
128,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"This is so bad, man. How do we even know this is the right town to look in??"
129,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Will you relax? Those kids said they were from South Park. We've just gotta go door to door. Do you have the composite sketch we did?
130,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,[holds up a sheet of paper] Yeah.
131,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Let's go! [they exit the truck and face the houses on one side of the street]
132,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Maybe you should start with the houses on the left, a-and I'll take the-"
133,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[stops him] Wait a minute. Check that out! [before them is a big pool in a backyard. The fence, which normally blocks off the view from the street, is destroyed, and tracks go through the gap all the way to the pool] Come on! [they move towards the pool and walk up the steps. Brian grabs some crap floating on the surface and shows it to Mike] Oh my good, look!"
134,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Whale poo.
135,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,We're close. We're really close!
136,9,13,Mrs Donovan,[the sliding door opens] Can I help you?
137,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,[drops the poo quickly and turns to face her] Oh... h-hello ma'am. We're just here to examine your pool.
138,9,13,Mrs Donovan,Oh.
139,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Have you noticed any whales in your pool at all?
140,9,13,Mrs Donovan,"No, I don't believe so. But we've been out of town for a couple of days and came back to find the fence broken. Do you think somebody's been using it?"
141,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Ma'am, do you recognize any of these boys? [Mike hands her the sketch. She takes it and studies it]"
142,9,13,Mrs Donovan,"The fat one in the middle... kinda looks like Dakota Fanning. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to get back to the oven. [hands the sketch back to the Mike]"
143,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[turns around, getting exasperated] We're too late. They've moved on to another town!"
144,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,We don't know that!
145,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"If they've moved on, then we have no leads! This is fate, Brian! It's fate! For telling the kids their naked dads were gonna beat them up! For thinking that screwing with kids was funny!"
146,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"[grabs his Mike and shakes him] It WAS funny!! It was funny, Bob! And it will be funny again, I swear to you! If those boys took the whale out of here, we would have seen them on the road! I'm telling you, we're close. It's going to be funny!"
147,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"[knocks three times] Kyle bubbe, we're taking Ike to the new Harry Potter movie. Wanna join us?"
148,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project."
149,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"All right. Well, there's pizza in the fridge if you and your friends get hungry. [Gerald goes down the stairs with Ike as she speaks, then she turns away and goes down the stairs]"
150,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay ma, thanks! [behind him is Jambu, and the other boys are keeping him moist]"
151,9,13,Butters Stotch,Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
152,9,13,Clyde Donovan,"Whales are mammals; they don't need water to breathe, dumb-ass."
153,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to keep him wet."
154,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program? [waits for the answer] How much to take a whale into space? [waits for the answer] Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on. [puts Mr. Sugiyama on hold as he answers another call] Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?"
155,9,13,Jimmy Valmer,[with Timmy and Tweek] The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
156,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
157,9,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. We told them that, a-and they told us to go f-fuck ourselves."
158,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Damnit! [hangs up without returning to Mr. Sugiyama] Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??"
159,9,13,Eric Cartman,He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
160,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah... He must be really sick. [walks up to the whale and strokes him] Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
161,9,13,Clyde Donovan,Mexico has a space program?
162,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?"
163,9,13,Man,Allб
164,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Thanks. [they leave and arrive at MASA - Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración] Is this the Mexican space program? [again, neglected beauty, and the place looks quite primitive for a space administration, straight out of the 1950s.]"
165,9,13,Man 2,"Space, sн. Fly."
166,9,13,Stan Marsh,Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
167,9,13,Man 2,"Follow, sí, show yo. [sets down the part he was cleaning and goes inside the complex. The boys follow him] The roque lunar?"
168,9,13,Stan Marsh,This rocket will fly to the moon?
169,9,13,Man 2,"Sí, fly."
170,9,13,Stan Marsh,To the moon?
171,9,13,Man 2,Sí.
172,9,13,Stan Marsh,[enunciates] We want to take something to the moon. How much would that cost?
173,9,13,Man 2,O-ah... Two hundred.
174,9,13,Stan Marsh,Two hundred? Million?
175,9,13,Man 2,Two hundred... dollars.
176,9,13,Stan Marsh,"[to Craig] Quick, call Kyle."
177,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Eh hello ma'am, uh, the teacher at the school said she recognized this boy to be your son? [Sheila takes the composite sketch and looks at Kyle's image]"
178,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh yes, that's my bubbe. Kind of a bad drawing though."
179,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Ma'am, we need to talk to your son, please! It's very urgent!"
180,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"I'm sorry, he just left. He's on his way to Mexico."
181,9,13,Both men,Mexico??
182,9,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Yehhs. As part of a school project, he's helping his class to move two donated grand pianos to needy school children in Tijuana. My little bubbe is very caring."
183,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Oh my God.
184,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Which highway did they take??
185,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch."
186,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang on, Willzy-x. Hang on, buddy."
187,9,13,Eric Cartman,We have to hurry!
188,9,13,Driver,I'm going as fast as I can.
189,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!."
190,9,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh hamburgers! What is that?? [The Denver Sea Park truck appears before them and blocks their way, so the driver stops. Brian steps out of the Sea Park truck. Mike joins him and they both stand before the Moovit truck until it stops, then they move to the driver's side door]"
191,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"All right, out of the truck!"
192,9,13,Eric Cartman,Uh oh.
193,9,13,Driver,What the hell is goin' on?!
194,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,You're carrying a stolen whale!
195,9,13,Driver,Stolen? You kids told me you won that whale at Pizza Hut!
196,9,13,Clyde Donovan,We're busted. [Brian and Mike roll up the trailer and Kyle looks]
197,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
198,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Come on out, kid. [the four other boys walk around Brian and stop]"
199,9,13,Driver,"Look, I didn't know nothin' about this."
200,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Just help us get the whale into our truck and we'll all keep quiet about this.
201,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!"
202,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Look, kid, we need to tell you a little secret. [a bright light comes on and a police siren sounds. They all turn to see who it is. Two motorcycle cops get off their bikes.]"
203,9,13,Cop 1,What's goin' on here??
204,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Aw crap.
205,9,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh, now we're gonna get it."
206,9,13,Cop 1,Hey... That's the stolen whale!
207,9,13,Cop 2,Everyone down on the ground. Now!
208,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No! Please, we have to go!"
209,9,13,Cop 2,You're not goin' anywhere! You're in a lot of trouble! [the first cop starts making arrests]
210,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried."
211,9,13,Cop 1,"We said down on the ground, kid. Move it! [three gunshots come out of nowhere, and everyone turns to see whom it could be now.]"
212,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Leave those kids alone, you bastards! Animal Liberation Front! [the ALF members growl]"
213,9,13,Cop 1,"Put down that weapon, now!"
214,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,These boys are trying to get that whale home! You're not gonna stop them!
215,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,All right!!
216,9,13,The Other Boys,Yes! Wow!
217,9,13,Cop 2,That whale belongs to a sea park!
218,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,It belongs with its family!
219,9,13,ALF Member,That's right!
220,9,13,Cop 1,I said drop the gun NOW!
221,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,Save the whale! [fires her gun and charges. The other ALF members charge and fire as well. Cop 2 is hit and falls. Cop 1 fires back. The boys hide behind the Moovit! truck]
222,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Jesus, Oh God! [he's soon riddled with bullet holes and falls over]"
223,9,13,ALF Member,"Save the whales, motherfucker!"
224,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,[fires a few more rounds over the boys' heads as she positions herself behind them] Where are you taking the whale?
225,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Tijuana, Mexico!"
226,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Of course. Brilliant! Release it in international waters. I'll drive the truck. [she and the boys get into the cab, Kyle stays in the trailer with the whale]"
227,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You're going home, Willzy-x! [the truck drives away, and Brian crawls over to Mike]"
228,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,Mike? Mike??
229,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,[still has enough life in him to cough and say] It... wasn't... funny...
230,9,13,Announcer Brian (voices Jambu/Willzy-x) and Partner Mike,"Don't say that, Mike. It was funny. It just wasn't that funny this time. [Mike's head drops] All the other times were still funny, Mike! They were still funny!!"
231,9,13,Cop 1,[crawls to his bike and grabs a radio] Forty-five to dispatch... Stolen whale... heading to Tijuana... Whaaale to Tijuana!! [falls]
232,9,13,Worker 1,"Conecte la segunda cadena. [""Connect the second chain.""]"
233,9,13,Worker 2,"No sé si va a llegar. [""I don't know if it'll reach.""]"
234,9,13,Stan Marsh,"They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?"
235,9,13,Manuel and other members of the Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración (MASA),"Sн, fly."
236,9,13,Butters Stotch,Look! The Mexican border!
237,9,13,Clyde Donovan,"Oh Jesus, they're here! [the Denver cops are right there with the border guard]"
238,9,13,Sergeant,"Hold your positions! [a police helicopter comes down. The owner of the sea park and the orca trainers step down from it, along with the security guard]"
239,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,Aha! We've got them!
240,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Hang on, boys."
241,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,Mary Mother of God! [the Moovit! truck barrels through the helicopter and blockade. Everyone in the way jumps out of the way. The Moovit! truck is now in Mexico]
242,9,13,Sergeant,"[lying face down, points at the truck] Get them!"
243,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Willzy-x, I think we're here."
244,9,13,Stan Marsh,[to the ALF leader] Back down the ramp! It's all rigged to go!
245,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"You got it, kid! [makes a quick right, then backs up left and towards the end of the dock]"
246,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,[arriving at MASA with the guard and trainers] Don't let them get that whale in the water! [Kyle rolls open the trailer door]
247,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it's all set to go! [the ALF van rolls in] Just get Willzy-x into the water! [some ALF officers emerge from the van.]"
248,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, guys! [Craig, Clyde, Kenny, Butters, and Cartman show up. Clyde and Kenny jump up and pull the ramp down]"
249,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,[starts to run in with the guard and trainers] Stop right now!
250,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Hurry, boys! We'll take care of them! [The zoo personnel and the ALF face off, with the ALF landing the first blows. Kelly goes down like a statue. At the dock, the boys struggle to move Willzy-x into the water]"
251,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang on. [looks around] Hold on a second. [steps down into the water and addresses Willzy-x] I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x. [the whale opens his mouth. Kyle begins to tear up] I'm gonna miss you. [Butters and Clyde tear up and look at each other] Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. [sniffs a bit, then pets the whale.]"
252,9,13,Eric Cartman,Oh crap! There's more of them! [police cruisers pour in and officers pour out of them]
253,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Get him in the water! [the boys pull Willzy-x once more, with a mighty pull] Goodbye, Willzy-x! [the whale takes to the water and the ALF cheers a job well done]"
254,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Swim, mighty whale! You're free!"
255,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Okay, Manuel, hit it. [Manuel presses the launch button]"
256,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,[advances with the guard and police] Stop! That is my whale!
257,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,I'm afraid you're too late! The whale's been set free.
258,9,13,Denver Sea Park Owner,No!
259,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,"Now you see that your ways of captivity and exploiting animals will never prevail. [behind her, a rocket rises into launch position] Not as long as there are children like these who still believe in the beauty and magic of freedom. [The park owner, guard, police, and now FBI gawk at her, or at the rocket behind her.] For it is children, with their innocence and their spirit, who know what is truly best for all the world."
260,9,13,ALF Members and Leader,Oh my God!
261,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,We did it!
262,9,13,Stan Marsh,"Thanks for the ride, Manuel."
263,9,13,Manuel and other members of the Mexicana Aeronáuti'co y Spacia Administración (MASA),"Sн, bye. [closes the door and drives off]"
264,9,13,Butters Stotch,"Well, see ya, fellas. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up."
265,9,13,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah, me too. [Craig goes off as well]"
266,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"All right. Thanks for your help, dudes. [the boys walk towards Kyle's house, but Kyle stops] Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing."
267,9,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. [Stan looks at the sky and steps forward. The other boys join him. Before them, up in the sky, is the full moon, bright and nicely detailed]"
268,9,13,Stan Marsh,I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
269,9,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle."
