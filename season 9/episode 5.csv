9,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Good call, ref! Good call!"
10,9,5,Mr Varcas,"Come on, Allen! This pitcher throws like a girl!"
11,9,5,Randy Marsh,What'd you say?!
12,9,5,Mr Varcas,"You heard me, asshole!"
13,9,5,Randy Marsh,You want me to kick your ass right here?! [Mr. Barkas stands and looks at him]
14,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, sit down."
15,9,5,Mr Varcas,You want a piece of me?! 'Cause I'm pretty sick of your Goddamned mouth!
16,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[takes off his shirt and throws it aside and challengers] Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?"

19,9,5,Randy Marsh,I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
20,9,5,Mr Varcas,I told you to SHUT UP! [throws his beer at Randy. Randy takes his beer and throws it at Mr. Barkas. They start fighting back and forth. Stan looks on from the pitcher's mound]
21,9,5,Stan Marsh,"[turns away and hides his face in his right hand] Aw Jesus, not again."
22,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Stan! Just strike this kid out so we can end the season! [Stan puts on his game face and throws the pitch. Alan swings and misses]"
23,9,5,Umpire,Strike three! You're out!
24,9,5,Stan Marsh,Yes! It's over! It's over!
25,9,5,Local Announcer 1,That's it. South Park wins the game 4 to 0.
26,9,5,Eric Cartman,[runs to the mound] We're done! No more baseball!
27,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,No more boring baseball until next year!
28,9,5,Stan Marsh,We can start having fun again! [falls to the ground and rolls around]
29,9,5,Eric Cartman,"All right, we did it! [the rest of the team shows up and celebrates]"
30,9,5,Stan Marsh,We did it! We did it!
31,9,5,Steven Stotch,"[as the coach, arrives] Yeah, we did it, boys! We did it! We're going to the finals! Woohoo! [the boys stop cheering and look at him]"
32,9,5,Stan Marsh,... What?
33,9,5,Steven Stotch,Well we won! That means we've got the best record in the division! [the parents rush onto the field]
34,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Congratulations, boys! You're goin' on to the post-season. Woohoo!"
35,9,5,Eric Cartman,Post-season?
36,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody said anything about a post-season.
37,9,5,Anchorman Tom,[Craig's Dad] There's more little-league baseball for South Park! Yehheah! [the adults begin celebrating while the kids are dumb-struck]
38,9,5,Stan Marsh,No... NOOO!!
39,9,5,Randy Marsh,"This is for what?! Arresting me for what?! I'm not allowed to stand up for myself?! I thought this was America! Huh?! Isn't this America?! I'm sorry, I thought this was America! [he's put into the back seat]"
40,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
41,9,5,Eric Cartman,Nobody told us if we win too many games we'd go on to the finals!
42,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad."
43,9,5,Craig Tucker,Not all that bad? How could you say that?! You hate this game more than any of us!
44,9,5,Stan Marsh,"I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over."
45,9,5,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, but... we usually win."
46,9,5,Craig Tucker,All the other teams are worse than us.
47,9,5,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. Let's face it, we're winners."
48,9,5,Stan Marsh,I know we can lose if we try.
49,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport."
50,9,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. My dad always said ""It's Okay to lose, but if you don't try, wuh you're grounded, Mister."""
51,9,5,The other boys,"Yeah, uh huh."
52,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know."
53,9,5,Butters Stotch,"We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!"
54,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Boy, that was great, wasn't it?!"
55,9,5,Mr Donovan,"Yeah, our boys really stuck it to 'em! [the doors open and Randy walks in]"
56,9,5,Randy Marsh,Heeey!
57,9,5,Men,Heeey!

59,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,How much was bail this time? [hands Randy a beer]
60,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Hundred bucks, no big whoop."
61,9,5,Mr. Richard Tweek,"[Tweek's dad] Boy, you really beat the crap out of that Conifer dad."
62,9,5,Randy Marsh,Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
63,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Yeah, well, you'd better watch yourself in the playoffs."
64,9,5,Randy Marsh,Wha-what do you mean?
65,9,5,Steven Stotch,"I mean, you always get in a fight with scrappy redneck dats up here in the mountains, but some of those Division Two dads are tough!"
66,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, those dads get REALLY drunk and obnoxious."
67,9,5,Randy Marsh,I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
68,9,5,DJ,...the Beatles in the White Album in Helter Skelter. Okay- [Randy clicks the radio off]
69,9,5,FC Announcer,"We want to welcome all South Park parents to Fort Collins, and the Little League Division One Playoffs. [applause all around as the teams meet on the field]"
70,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh, [pulls out a yellow sheet of paper] here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order."
71,9,5,FC Team,Ooooo!
72,9,5,FC Fat Player,"I don't think so, South Park"
73,9,5,FC Pitcher,"Yeah, you think we wanna win? Then we have to keep playing this boring game!"
74,9,5,FC Team,Yeah!
75,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,You hate this game too?
76,9,5,FC Batter,Yeah! And then we won the stupid regionals and had to do this lousy-ass tournament!
77,9,5,FC Catcher,We wanna play video games.
78,9,5,Butters Stotch,Oh no!
79,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!"
80,9,5,FC Pitcher,I don't think so! There's no way you can lose to us! We're going doowwn! We're gonna get creeaamed!

87,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[nudges Sharon] Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. [drinks. On the field, Fort Collins is up at bat]"
88,9,5,Eric Cartman,"All right, hit one out of the park!"
89,9,5,FC Announcer,And first up for Fort Collins is... Morgan Pratt.
90,9,5,Randy Marsh,Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter!
91,9,5,Mr Pratt,"Knock it out of the park, Morgan! Cream these turds! [Morgan gets ready to swing, Stan sends his pitch and Cartman catches. Morgan does not swing]"
92,9,5,Umpire,Steerike!
93,9,5,Randy Marsh,Yeah!
94,9,5,FC Team,"Yeah, all right!"
95,9,5,Stan Marsh,Damnit!
96,9,5,Eric Cartman,"[sends the ball back to Stan] Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it."
97,9,5,Morgan Pratt,No way! I'm striking out!
98,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he's not gonna swing! So just throw balls. That way he'll have to walk to first base. [Stan thinks, then throws the pitch. It goes wide and Cartman catches it]"
99,9,5,Umpire,Ball!
100,9,5,Eric Cartman,All right! [throws it back to Stan]
101,9,5,FC Pitcher,Morgan!
102,9,5,Morgan Pratt,[looks over] What?
103,9,5,FC Pitcher,"You have to swing when it's a ball, otherwise, you're gonna walk to first base. Don't swing, only if it's a strike!"
104,9,5,Morgan Pratt,[faces the dugout] Well how the Sam Hell am I supposed to know if he's gonna be throwing a strike or a ball?!
105,9,5,FC Pitcher,You just have to guess.
106,9,5,Morgan Pratt,"Aw, Jesus! [turns around and goes back to bat. Stan looks to Cartman for cues]"
107,9,5,Eric Cartman,Ball. Balll. [Stan pitches right down the middle]
108,9,5,Umpire,Steerike two!
109,9,5,Stan Marsh,No!
110,9,5,Eric Cartman,"That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!"
111,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!"
112,9,5,Mr Pratt,"Come on Fort Collins! This team can't pitch! [Stan pitches, Morgan hits] There you go, Morgan! Run run run!"
113,9,5,Morgan Pratt,Aw damnit! [heads to first base]
114,9,5,FC Pitcher,Why the hell did you swing at it?!
115,9,5,Morgan Pratt,Well I thought he was gonna throw a ball that time! [Fort Collins is ahead 1-0. Another FC batter comes up...]
116,9,5,Umpire,Strike three! You're out!
117,9,5,FC Batter 1,All right!
118,9,5,Umpire,Ball four!
119,9,5,Eric Cartman,What?!
120,9,5,Randy Marsh,Walk to first! Woo!
121,9,5,Eric Cartman,"[throws his bat down and walks] Aw Goddamnit! [as Cartman walks to first, anotherr SP runner walks home]"
122,9,5,Umpire,Safe!
123,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Crud! [the scorekeeper updates the board]
124,9,5,Randy Marsh,Fort Collins can't play!
125,9,5,Mr Pratt,Why don't you shut your mouth before I kick your ass!
126,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[gets up and takes off his shirt] Come on, let's go! I'm right here!"
127,9,5,Sharon Marsh,Randy...
128,9,5,Mr Pratt,Sit down before you get hurt! [Randy throws his beer at him] Mother bitch! [the two men begin fighting on the bleachers]
129,9,5,Stan Marsh,"[sees, turns away and hides his face in his right hand] Goddamnit... [the men have taken the fight to the field and are next to a trashcan. Stan pitches and the FC batter fails to swing]"
130,9,5,Umpire,Strike three! [The South Park adults stand up and cheer. The next scenes go into time-lapse: more runs are added until the final score is reached: 4 - 3]
131,9,5,FC Announcer,That's it. South Park wins the game. [the Fort Collins team cheers]
132,9,5,Stan Marsh,Aw spit! [throws his mitt down on the mound. His father is arrested again with his pants around his ankles and hauled towards a waiting patrol car]
133,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[slurred] Oh I'm sorry! Why don'tcha get 'im on chars in America, I'm sorry!"
134,9,5,Umpire,Strike three. You're out.

143,9,5,Eric Cartman,"How the hell was that a strike?! [starts kicking dirt on the umpire] Goddamnit, he's going to first!"
144,9,5,Randy Marsh,"What, is this a Communist country or something?! I thought this was America!"
145,9,5,Umpire,¡Strrrrike tres!
146,9,5,Pueblo Team,Bueno bueno! Bueno! Espectacular!
147,9,5,Pueblo Dad,¡Vamonos Pueblo! ¡Viva la Pueblo!
148,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[using a Spanish textbook for assistance] ¡Pueblo, no bueno! ¡Pueblo es muy mal! [a pitch is sent to an SP batter, who doesn't swing]"
149,9,5,Umpire,"¡Ball cuatro, por favor! [the scoreboard is updated, Randy fights with the Pueblo dad and is hauled off a fourth time]"
150,9,5,Randy Marsh,This is America! This is an honest America!
151,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Can you believe it, boys?! We're playing in the State Championship Game! [the adults cheer]"
152,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,We're so proud of you kids!
153,9,5,Eric Cartman,What happens if we win the State Championship game?
154,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Well, then your whole season starts over, but on the national circuit! You get to spend your whole summer playing baseball!"
155,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
156,9,5,Mr Donovan,"You could do it, kids! We know you can win State!"
157,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Then we'll spend the whole summer going to Nebraska, and to Iowa, and Wyoming."
158,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh no. No, no, no!"
159,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Dad? Dad, we need to talk."
160,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[doesn't move] Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever."
161,9,5,Stan Marsh,[sighs] Goddamnit. [goes back into the restaurant]
162,9,5,Randy Marsh,"I've worked hard, believed in myself, and now I'm gonna be fighting in a State Championship game. [smiles] This is gonna be the biggest fight of my life."
163,9,5,Announcer,"This is News 4, at noon."
164,9,5,Anchor Tom,The Colorado Little League State Championship is being played this week. Two teams of youngsters get to go head to head at the major-league stadium downtown.
165,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Tom, I'm standing here with the little sluggers and some of their parents, and I can't tell you how excited they are."
166,9,5,Stan Marsh,I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
167,9,5,Denver Player,Win? Why the hell would we want to win?
168,9,5,Denver Player 2,Yeah. Then we'd have to play this boring game all summer.
169,9,5,Reporter Chris,"[draws closer to the teams] Little Stan Marsh is the pitcher for the South Park Little League team, and Stan, how does it feel to be playing for the State Championship?"
170,9,5,Stan Marsh,Gay.
171,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Mr. Marsh, you must be very proud of your son."
172,9,5,Randy Marsh,"They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really ""trash-talk,"" but, I don't think Denver has a chance."
173,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Oho, well, I'm sure some of the Denver kids' parents would disagree with you and your team-"
174,9,5,Bat dad,"[blue headdress and cape, pops in] Oh yeah! Oh yeah! [leaps closer to the camera] South Park is goin' down! Feel it comin'! [humps back to Randy] You ain't got a chance, South Park! Here we go, Denver, here we go! Huh, huh!"
175,9,5,Sheila Broflovski,Who's that?
176,9,5,A Woman,"That's Tom Nelson, one of the Denver players' fathers. He goes to every game in that ridiculous outfit and usually drinks too much and gets into a fight."
177,9,5,"Tom ""Bat Dad"" Nelson",There ain't no way some little mountain kids can beat Denver. Not with my son on second base!
178,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Oho, looks like we got some parental trash talking going on here. Mr. Marsh, any comments?"
179,9,5,Randy Marsh,Well I think that there's a uh...
180,9,5,"Tom ""Bat Dad"" Nelson",Mr. Marsh? Who wants to hear from a Mr. Marsh?! Iii am the ultimate Little League trash-talking father! Iii am the Bat Dad!
181,9,5,Denver Cop,"[one of two come to take him away] All right, Mr. Nelson, let's go, come on."
182,9,5,"Tom ""Bat Dad"" Nelson","Bat Dad knows no fear! Bat Dad knows no pain! I want you, Marsh! I want you!!"
183,9,5,Reporter Chris,"Well, tension is certainly high here, but I guess everything will be decided on the playing field."
184,9,5,Randy Marsh,[realizing he could end up like that] Oh my God.
185,9,5,Denver Player 3,Good luck! You're gonna need it.
186,9,5,Denver Player 4,"Yeah, you can't lose to us. We're terrible. [the Denver team leaves, as do all the adults]"
187,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game."
188,9,5,Eric Cartman,"Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team."
189,9,5,Clyde Donovan,Like that motorcycle kid in Bad News Bears.
190,9,5,Eric Cartman,"Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass."
191,9,5,Stan Marsh,Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
192,9,5,Craig Tucker,But who?
193,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,I know who.
194,9,5,Announcer,"Announcing the arrival of flight six seven three, from New York City. [among the people leaving the airport is Kyle's cousin, Kyle]"
195,9,5,Kyle 1,I'm baaack!
196,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. [the team goes up to greet him]"
197,9,5,Kyle 1,"Hello, cousin Kyle. Oh Jesus, that flight was terrible. They served a chicken dish with hot sauce and it gave me gas."
198,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team."
199,9,5,Kyle 1,"Well, you said you needed my help to win the big game, so here I am. I'll need a wipe cloth if I'm gonna play, though. Sometimes I sweat from holding the bat for so long and then the heat steams up my glasses."
200,9,5,Craig Tucker,He's perfect.
201,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, with him on our team, we don't stand a chance."
202,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[softly] ...I'm not gonna go. [Sharon's eyes opem, and she rises a bit]"
203,9,5,Sharon Marsh,What?
204,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go."
205,9,5,Sharon Marsh,Why?
206,9,5,Randy Marsh,"I just... don't think I can, all right?"
207,9,5,Sharon Marsh,You don't think you can?! This is the biggest game of your son's life! Why wouldn't you go and support him? What-? [Randy rises and faces her]
208,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Because I'm scared, all right?! [Sharon stays quiet] You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore. [turns away and bows his head] I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon."
209,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"So then, don't. You don't have to get in fights with other parents at Little League games! Just sit there and watch!"
210,9,5,Randy Marsh,"Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am."
211,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"No, I'm telling you you don't have to get thrown out of games and make an ass of yourself."
212,9,5,Randy Marsh,"I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. [walks off]"
213,9,5,Announcer,Welcome to the Colorado Little League State Championship Game! [the crowd cheers] This must be pretty exciting for these youngsters. A chance to go to the national circuit. [the teams meet at the pitcher's mound]
214,9,5,Denver Pitcher,You know what these guys look like to me? A bunch of winners!
215,9,5,Denver Catcher,Yeah! We're about to get our asses kicked!
216,9,5,Eric Cartman,I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
217,9,5,Denver Pitcher,You're the best!
218,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
219,9,5,Denver Pitcher,"Not a chance, 'cause we're gonna lose to you right now!"
220,9,5,Bat Dad,"Here we go, Denver! These South Park kids got nothin' on you! Let's go, Denver!"
221,9,5,Woman,"Chris, will you sit down?"
222,9,5,Announcer,"[in the Press Box] First up to bat for South Park, Kyle Schwartz. [Kyle 1 comes up to bat]"
223,9,5,Kyle 1,[stands on home plate] Where do I stand?
224,9,5,Umpire,"R-right over here. [Kyle 1 looks, then goes to one side of the plate with his back to the pitcher. The umpire positions him properly]"
225,9,5,Kyle 1,"Don't throw the ball too fast, because I might get startled and I have asthma. [The pitcher throws the ball. Kyle 1 pulls his bat back]"
226,9,5,Umpire,Strike 1!
227,9,5,SP Team,Yeah! All right!
228,9,5,Kyle 1,"Jesus, not so close! That was three feet from hitting me in the head!"
229,9,5,Second Baseman,He's not gonna swing! Throw balls!
230,9,5,Kyle 1,[swings and misses] Oh Jesus!
231,9,5,Umpire,Strike 2!
232,9,5,SP Team,Yeah!
233,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Wow, he IS great at sucking."
234,9,5,Eric Cartman,[happily] We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
235,9,5,Kyle 1,"Don't throw it so hard or so close next time! Is it cold out here? I think I need a jacket. [The pitcher squints and focuses on the bat, which says ""Barry Bonds"" on it. The pitcher throws the ball and hits the bat, which falls out of Kyle Schwartz's hands]"
236,9,5,Umpire,It's a bunt!
237,9,5,Mr Donovan,"Run kid, run!"
238,9,5,Kyle 1,Oh Jesus! [runs towards first base]
239,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Aw crap! [Stan drops. Kyle 1 goes towards second and no one is stopping him. He passes it]
240,9,5,Kyle 1,"[out of breath] I can't, I can't keep running like this! I have corns in my feet!"
241,9,5,Steven Stotch,"Keep running, kid! [one of the SP players has his face buried in his right hand]"
242,9,5,Bat Dad,"Throw the ball to third, you idiots! He's runnin' home! [Kyle 1 heads towards home and passes that]"
243,9,5,Umpire,"Safe! [the crowd cheers and the scoreboard displays him and ""HOMERUN!!!!"" underneath. Smaller screens on the board display fireworks]"
244,9,5,Kyle 1,"Oh Jesus, did you see that? I hit a homerun! High-five, everybody! [nobody high-fives him]"
245,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
246,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we had it all wrong. While we spent all our time trying to make our team suck, these guys practiced and got really good at sucking. [next pitch: the ball hits the bat again, and the SP runner has to go to first, as it's a bunt. Token goes up. The pitch hits the bat at the top - another bunt]"
247,9,5,Token Black,No!
248,9,5,Mr Williams,Yeeaahh! Go Token go!
249,9,5,Bat Dad,"All right, Denver! You're up to bat now! [Butters is waving his hand for some reason, and the Danver batter squints and focuses on Butters' glove. Stan pitches, the batter hits, and Butters catches the ball. He's dismayed to find it in his glove.]"
250,9,5,Umpire,Out!
251,9,5,Denver Team,Yaaay!
252,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out! [the scoreboard is updated in time-lapse: Denver doesn't have a run on there.] Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long."
253,9,5,Butters Stotch,"[frustrated, takes his cap off and throws it on the ground] Son of a biscuit!"
254,9,5,Announcer,"It's the bottom of the last inning here at Coors Field; the score is South Park 23, Denver 0. [a tired Stan pitches right down the middle and the Denver player doesn't move]"
255,9,5,Umpire,Strike 1!
256,9,5,Bat Dad,"Come on, Denver! Get the lead out! Do not cross the Bat Daaad!"
257,9,5,Gerald Broflovski,Geez I really wish this guy would shut up.
258,9,5,Bat Dad,"Why don't you just go home, South Park? You can't beat Denver!"
259,9,5,A Voice,"Denver sucks ass! [Bat Dad looks over. Randy has arrived with a tray of five beers. He's ready to rumble. He sits three rows behind Bat Dad, next to Sharon] Come on, South Park! These kids can't play! In fact, these kids are terrible! [Stan pitches, the batter swings after Cartman catches the ball]"
260,9,5,Umpire,Strike 2!
261,9,5,Kyle 1,"Oh Jesus, we're gonna win! I I never won a sport before; this is so exciting."
262,9,5,Randy Marsh,"It's over, Denver! South Park whupped your ass!"
263,9,5,Bat Dad,You'd better shut your mouth before I shut it for you!
264,9,5,Randy Marsh,"[stands up, takes off his shirt, and challenges] What do you wanna do, huh? [Bat Dad climbs over the seats and he and Randy begin to fight, taking it to the aisle]"
265,9,5,Stan Marsh,"[sees, turns away and hides his face in his right hand] This can't get any worse. [the two men continue fighting at the bottom of the level and towards the foul pole. Bat Dad picks Randy up and throws him over the railing. Randy bounces off a bench, breaking it in two.]"
266,9,5,Bat Dad,"[stands on the railing and spreads his cape wide open] Now for the finishing move! You're about to be Bat-Dadded! [jumps off, but misses Randy entirely. They end up in the bullpen.]"
267,9,5,Commentator,"It all comes down to this! South Park is just one pitch away from being State Champions. [Bat Dad delivers blow after blow and has Randy on the run] Oh geez, it looks like two parents are fighting. They'd better be careful. The Little League has a no-tolerance policy."
268,9,5,Umpire,"[comes out of home plate towards the men] Stop! Stop, or you're gonna get your teams disqualified!"
269,9,5,Stan Marsh,"[comes off the mound and stands next to Kyle] Disqualified? [looks at Kyle for a few seconds] Fight! Keep fighting! [the fighting continues, and two more umpires enter the picture]"
270,9,5,Umpire 2,"Break it up! Break it up! [the fighting continues. Bat Dad delivers a blow, shown in slow motion. It connects, and Randy falls backwards to the ground] That's enough! The next person that fights is getting his team disqualified!"
271,9,5,Bat Dad,"He's done for anyway. [walks off. Randy rises, slowly]"
272,9,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Dad! Get up!"
273,9,5,Kyle Broflovski,Get up! You have to fight! [Randy is trying]
274,9,5,Umpire 2,"All right, come on! Let's play ball!"
275,9,5,SP Team,Randy! Randy! Randy!
276,9,5,Mickey,"Get up, Randy! Get up, ya bum!"
277,9,5,Sharon Marsh,"Get up, Randy! Fight! Fight for me!"
278,9,5,Crowd,Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
279,9,5,Randy Marsh,[now standing] Hey Bat Dad! [Bat Dad turns around] I didn't hear no bell.
280,9,5,SP Team,"Yeah! [Randy goes on the attack, delivering blow after blow. The umpire and guard return]"
281,9,5,Umpire 2,"Stop, stop right now! [Randy continues the assault] I'm warning you, sir! [Randy begins singing in falsetto, then knocks Bat Dad to the ground with one final blow.] That's it! That's it! South Park is disqualified!"
282,9,5,SP Team,Yeah!
283,9,5,SP Adults,Aww!
284,9,5,Commentator,"South Park has been disqualified from the game! Denver wins! [The South Park team goes over to Randy, take off their hats, and celebrate their defeat. The Denver players are dismayed at this turn of events and throw down their caps. Two Denver officers come in to get Randy]"
285,9,5,Kyle 1,We... We lost.
286,9,5,Randy Marsh,[now arrested and turned around] What? I thought this was a free country! [now being escorted out of the Field]
287,9,5,Stan Marsh,Dad! [the guards let go and Randy turns around] You're the greatest. [Randy leaps for joy!]
