0,9,11,Token Black,"Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. [the projector turns off and Token takes his seat as Timmy claps a little]"
1,9,11,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Token. Thank you. 'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let's have ah Eric."
2,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to the front of the class and turns around, looking at his paper] Thank you, Mrs. Garrison. [reads] My speech is entitled ""Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles."" [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids. [cues up his pics. A red-headed boy appears] Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles. [next picture is of a girl licking her triple-scoop ice-cream cone] Aw, nasty! Yuck! [returns to his paper] This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls."
3,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,[annoyed at Cartman's ignorance] What?!
4,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured. [another redheaded girls pops up] Ah sick! [another redhead] Gross! [another redhead] Yeck! [returns to his paper] Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike... [a picture of a vampire with a full moon and bats behind him pops up] vampires."
5,9,11,Class,Aaaah.
6,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"That's not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don't have to avoid the sun!"
7,9,11,Eric Cartman,"I was getting to that, if you will let me. [returns to his paper] Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called ""daywalkers."" [cues up a picture of Kyle, with ""daywalkers"" written underneath]"
8,9,11,Butters Stotch,Ho! Daywalkers!
9,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,This is all a bunch of crap!
10,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions..."
11,9,11,Mrs Garrison,"Kyle, let Eric give his presentation."
12,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!"
13,9,11,Clyde Donovan,[glances around] I am.
14,9,11,Mrs Garrison,"Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!"
15,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Fine, I will! [crosses his arms]"
16,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth! [Kyle grits his teeth and growls, trying to contain himself] Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, [next picture: a boy with a few missing front teeth] and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one, [the last pic is that of Carrot Top] think again. [the bell rings and the kids file out of the classroom.]"
17,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Stupid supremacist asswipe!
18,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what's the big deal?"
19,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?"
20,9,11,Stan Marsh,[thinks a moment] What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
21,9,11,Three kids,Hello?
22,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
23,9,11,Girl,[the middle child] Sure. Come on in. [waves them in. They enter]
24,9,11,Boy,"[the oldest child] Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us."
25,9,11,Father,"What? Heh, hello there, kids."
26,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles."
27,9,11,Father,"[nervous throughout] Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals."
28,9,11,Stan Marsh,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes."
29,9,11,Father,"Yes, we've learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds? [breaks down and sobs into his hands]"
30,9,11,Mother,"A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don't know. [her husband stops sobbing and raises his head] If your spouse is also a carrier, then your children can turn out like... them. [they both look at the kids, who smile and grin]"
31,9,11,Father,Each one of them's a blessing.
32,9,11,Mother,"Oh yes, each one of them's a blessing."
33,9,11,Father,Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.
34,9,11,Three kids,"[grinning] Thanks, Mom and Dad."
35,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. [somber music plays]
36,9,11,Father,"No... no, I'm sure they do. [quickly rises and shows the boys to the door] Well it was nice meeting you boys. We've gotta get dinner started."
37,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,I just had a couple more questions about-
38,9,11,Father,"Look, boys, if you really don't wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don't carry the recessive gene. [looks right and left] I know a guy who's marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason. [closes the door on them and they turn around]"
39,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul, [Cartman yawns] but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. [turns off the projector and goes to his desk amid some applause]"
40,9,11,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go. [the bell rings] All right, that's lunch, kids. We'll pick up with Clyde's speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess."
41,9,11,Butters Stotch,"That was a very informative speech, Kyle."
42,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks Butters
43,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Informative if you want to die. [hops off his seat and joins Butters and Kyle] Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all. [moves towards the door] Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! [points at Clyde, who jumps back.]"
44,9,11,Stan Marsh,You buying school lunch today?
45,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch."
46,9,11,Clyde Donovan,"[off screen] Right this way! [the camera shows four boys - Craig, Jimmy, Clyde and Token - kicking a redhead out] You can't eat in the cafeteria! [Craig crosses his arms]"
47,9,11,Boy,How come?
48,9,11,Token Black,Ginger kids eat in the hallway!
49,9,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard! [the redhead walks off and the other four boys go back inside the cafeteria]"
50,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
51,9,11,Stan Marsh,"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger."
52,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,[thinks] Hey. [snaps his fingers] That's a great idea!
53,9,11,Kenny McCormick,(What's a great idea?)
54,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
55,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Sure, for what?"
56,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
57,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Okay dude, knock him out. [Kyle takes out a small club and starts beating Cartman with it. After five blows Stan rushes over to stop him] Dude, dude okay, he's out! [with the club gone, Kyle resorts to punching Cartman out] Kyle, that's good! [Kenny puts his ear to the door and listens for any activity in the hallway] All right, let's do it."
58,9,11,Liane Cartman,"Eric honey, time to get up for school. [heads back to the kitchen downstairs. Cartman rolls over and wakes up, hops down and leaves his room]"
59,9,11,Eric Cartman,"-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-"
60,9,11,Liane Cartman,"[hears him and drops the spatula] Poopsiekins! [rushes back to the restroom, leaving her eggs cooking. Cartman checks his face thoroughly, but continues to scream. Liane arrives and enters] Sweetie, what is the- [he turns around and she screams] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
61,9,11,Eric Cartman,I'M GINGER!
62,9,11,Liane Cartman,Oh my God! Eric!
63,9,11,Eric Cartman,Help me! Hellp mee!
64,9,11,Doctor,"Well, all his vital signs are still normal. From his outward appearance, I would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency."
65,9,11,Liane Cartman,You mean...
66,9,11,Doctor,"Yes, I'm afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus."
67,9,11,Eric Cartman,And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
68,9,11,Doctor,"Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must've stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence."
69,9,11,Eric Cartman,So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
70,9,11,Doctor,"[puts a hand on Cartman's back] I'm sorry, son. [takes Liane aside] Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you? [walks a few steps with Liane] Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can't stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down."
71,9,11,Liane Cartman,Oh... [looks away. Cartman hops off the bed and walks up and stands between them.]
72,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like! [crosses his arms] Right, Mom?! [a bit shocked when she doesn't answer right away] Mom?!"
73,9,11,Liane Cartman,"Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie."
74,9,11,Doctor,"All right, but... you're gonna have to take certain precautions now. It's very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy."
75,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey dudes, what's goin' on? [coughs to clear his throat] How is everything with you guys?"
76,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, Cartman. You look... different."
77,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency."
78,9,11,Stan Marsh,"You mean,you're a ginger?"
79,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Actually, gingervitus is the medical term."
80,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Is that an umbrella you're using?
81,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Kyle. [coughs] The sun's rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I'm outside. Well, I'm glad we've gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal."
82,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Stan for a moment] ...Wow, that's a little ironic, isn't it?"
83,9,11,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, Kyle?"
84,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one."
85,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[thinks] Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. [the school bus pulls up and opens its doors. The kids climb in and find seats]"
86,9,11,Eric Cartman,"That's fine, just get it out of the way..."
87,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this is going awesome."
88,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. [Butters strokes his nose, then takes out a napkin to wipe away tears from the laughter, then sighs, only to resume laughing, harder. Cartman just folds his arms across his chest and looks away]"
89,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[Walks up to an empty space between Clyde and Token] Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? [begins to eat]"
90,9,11,Token Black,What are you doing?
91,9,11,Eric Cartman,I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
92,9,11,Clyde Donovan,You're not supposed to be in the cafeteria.
93,9,11,Eric Cartman,Huh?
94,9,11,Craig Tucker,You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.
95,9,11,Eric Cartman,But... it's me.
96,9,11,Clyde Donovan,"Right. And you're a ginger. [at a nearby table, Stan is about to eat his burger, but Kyle softly jabs him]"
97,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, check it out. [Stan looks over]"
98,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. [the camera looks around at the other kids at the table, who remain silent]"
99,9,11,Clyde Donovan,"Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming."
100,9,11,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, beat it, j... jackass. [Cartman is stunned, but takes his tray and walks away. He walks past Kyle, Stan, and Kenny.]"
101,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers."
102,9,11,Eric Cartman,"I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!"
103,9,11,Boy,Yeah!
104,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!"
105,9,11,Older Boy,My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.
106,9,11,Eric Cartman,"...Riiight, exactly! We can't let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like... [he can't think of any] Like uh... [looks up in thought, then softly] Liiike..."
107,9,11,Girl,Ron Howard?
108,9,11,Eric Cartman,Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
109,9,11,Older Boy,Ron Howard? [the other redheads look at him]
110,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!"
111,9,11,Ginger Kids,Yeah!
112,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power! [Stan stops the game and the boys look at the source of commotion. Cartman leads the gingers across the playground]
113,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
114,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
115,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
116,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
117,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
118,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
119,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
120,9,11,Eric Cartman,"We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!"
121,9,11,Gingers,Yeah!
122,9,11,Eric Cartman,[resumes the march] Red Power!
123,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
124,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
125,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
126,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,I don't believe it.
127,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
128,9,11,Stan Marsh,Should we tell him the truth?
129,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
130,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Nah, let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer. [he and Stan return to their tetherball game]"
131,9,11,Eric Cartman,Red Power!
132,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
133,9,11,Eric Cartman,Better red than dead!
134,9,11,Gingers,Better red than dead!
135,9,11,Eric Cartman,Better red than dead!
136,9,11,Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of ""Annie"" has just premiered to cries of outrage. [a shot of gingers with Cartman front and center] A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie [shown, in character] is being played by a girl [shown in regular clothes and real hair] who isn't actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman."
137,9,11,Eric Cartman,That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
138,9,11,Field Reporter,What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?
139,9,11,Eric Cartman,The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
140,9,11,Gingers,Yeah! That's right! [among other things]
141,9,11,Eric Cartman,"There she is! Get her! [the gingers rush her and start ganging up on her] Die, you stupid bitch!"
142,9,11,Field Reporter,"This is getting pretty ugly, Tom. These gingers are really riled up! If you are a ginger and would like to join The Ginger Separatist Movement, you can attend their first meeting this Friday in the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton."
143,9,11,Older Boy,"Okay, welcome, everyone. It's so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first All-Ginger Pride Conference! [everyone cheers] Now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers, Eric Cartman!"
144,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[comes in pumped up like a televangelist to his own theme music] Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'? [the redhead cheer] Can I get a Red Power?"
145,9,11,Gingers,Red Power!
146,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!"
147,9,11,Gingers,Yeah!!
148,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! [all the redheads cheer wildly]"
149,9,11,Gary Nelson,Hello there! Gary Nelson with Hilton Guest Relations. Just making sure you guys have everything you need. [long silence]
150,9,11,Eric Cartman,"We're fine, thanks."
151,9,11,Gary Nelson,Need any buffet items restocked? Everyone okay on coffee?
152,9,11,Eric Cartman,We're fine!
153,9,11,Gary Nelson,"Great. Oh, and hey guys, just wanted to say thanks for choosing the Airport Hilton for your conference."
154,9,11,Eric Cartman,"You're welcome!! Now leave us alone!! [Gary closes the door] My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them!"
155,9,11,Ginger 1,Huh
156,9,11,Ginger 2,What
157,9,11,Ginger 3,Ex-terminate?
158,9,11,Eric Cartman,Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
159,9,11,Gingers,Wirha! atta!
160,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!"
161,9,11,Stan Marsh,Huh? Why?
162,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!"
163,9,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)"
164,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Are you in?
165,9,11,Stan Marsh,... totally.
166,9,11,Stan Marsh,"You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night."
167,9,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Hehe, yeah, heh) [Stan stops and gasps. The other two stop. Before them stand at least five redheads]"
168,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Oh... hey there. [long silence]
169,9,11,Stan Marsh,You guys... need... anything? [long silence]
170,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's just... let's just walk this way. [starts to cross the street, Stan and Kenny follow him, but they all see more gingers crawl out of the bushes across the street]"
171,9,11,Stan Marsh,"More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home."
172,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, good idea. [the boys go back the way the came. Gingers converge upon them, and they begin to run]"
173,9,11,Stan Marsh,The hell do they want? [A redhead comes in from the right side and snatches Kenny away]
174,9,11,Kenny McCormick,(AH!)
175,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny!
176,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Run, dude, run!!"
177,9,11,Clyde Donovan,[gathers his covers around him] Uh... Gi... ginger kids! AAAAAH! [his parents leave their room]
178,9,11,Mom,"Clyde? What is it, honey? [they go to his room and open his door, and are horrified. Before them is his window, wiiide open, and his empty bed. The wind howls outside]"
179,9,11,Boy,Aaah! [turns around] Ginger kids! Nooo! [a ginger girl grabs a hold of him]
180,9,11,Ginger Girl,"Laaa la, laaa lala."
181,9,11,Girl,What is it?
182,9,11,Ginger Girl,laaa lala.
183,9,11,Boy,It's a... little ginger girl.
184,9,11,Ginger Girl,laaa la.
185,9,11,Girl,Shut the door!
186,9,11,Ginger Girl,"Laaa la, laaa lala, laaa la."
187,9,11,Ginger Kids,AAAAAH! [they panic and run away. The boy runs into the banister and falls down. The girl trips over him]
188,9,11,Boy,Ow!
189,9,11,Ginger Girl,"[reaches the entrance] Laaa la, laaa lala."
190,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"In there! Let's go! [he and Stan run into it and close the doors. They run to a long log and lift it up] Get this jamb on the door! [they throw the jamb into place. Redheads try to wrestle the roads open but can't budge it. A window nearby breaks open and gingers start to crawl in through it. More windows break open, then the walls and doors start falling apart as the gingers barge in. Another ginger looks in from the roof and drops down to join the others. They grab Stan and Kyle, who scream one last time]"
191,9,11,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. Kyle, wake up."
192,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[wakes up] Huh. Whaaa? [stands up] Where are we? [walks to the cage wall and looks out. The Sunset Room is dark and red from the glow of a lava cauldron. There are cages all over the place, even hanging from the ceiling. The ginger kids stand around the cauldron]"
193,9,11,Stan Marsh,I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
194,9,11,Eric Cartman,My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! [the gingers stomp and cheer]
195,9,11,Stan Marsh,Cartman?
196,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh Jesus, I should have known!"
197,9,11,Eric Cartman,"What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! [more stomping and cheering]"
198,9,11,Gary Nelson,"You guys got everything you need in here? Need more coffee, buffet items?"
199,9,11,Eric Cartman,"No, we're fine! Thank you!"
200,9,11,Gary Nelson,How about lava? You got enough lava?
201,9,11,Eric Cartman,Yes! We're good!
202,9,11,Gary Nelson,"Okay. Hey, thanks for choosin' the Airport Hilton, guys."
203,9,11,Eric Cartman,"You're welcome, now leave us alone!! [Gary leaves and closes the door] Now! Let the extermination begin! [more stomping and cheering] We will start... with the daywalker!"
204,9,11,Gingers,"Daywalker! [The cage door opens and Kyle, handcuffed, is hauled out by two redheads and escorted to Cartman] Throw him in!"
205,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman! I need to tell you something!
206,9,11,Eric Cartman,Go on then! Say your last words!
207,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
208,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Okay fine, let him speak! [the redheads let Kyle go, and Kyle falls on his face] Then we kill every non-ginger here! [Kyle gets up, walks over to Cartman, and whispers in his ear. Cartman's anger vanishes, then surprise appears] You... you what? [Kyle repeats himself. Cartman looks around a bit fearfully, then touches his face all over and grits his teeth]"
209,9,11,Ginger Boy,"Come on, let's fulfill the plan! All non-gingers must die!"
210,9,11,Gingers,Yeah!
211,9,11,Eric Cartman,"[now hesitant] Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something. [backpedals] We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us. [throws away his staff] What have we become?"
212,9,11,Gingers,Huh? What?
213,9,11,Eric Cartman,"D-don't you see? If we go and exterminate everyone who isn't ginger, then we're no better than they were for thinking less of us. Maybe we all have to learn to live... together."
214,9,11,Ginger Boy 2,But... you just said everyone who isn't ginger must die.
215,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like."
216,9,11,Ginger Boy 2,But you just said they should all die fifteen seconds ago.
217,9,11,Eric Cartman,"See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. [the gingers look at him, stunned]"
218,9,11,Ginger Boy,"[long beat, then] What did that kid in the green hat tell you?"
219,9,11,Eric Cartman,... Huh?
220,9,11,Ginger Boy,That kid right there. What did he just tell you?
221,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated."
222,9,11,Ginger Boy,"You wanted to kill everyone who wasn't ginger, then that kid in the green hat told you something, and now you don't wanna do it all of a sudden. What did he tell you?"
223,9,11,Eric Cartman,"No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together."
224,9,11,Gingers,"[unsure] Ginger or not, it's all the same."
225,9,11,Eric Cartman,That's it! You've got it!
226,9,11,Cartman and the Gingers,"Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame. 
Hand in hand, we can live together."
227,9,11,Eric Cartman,Live together!
228,9,11,Gingers,We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same.
229,9,11,Eric Cartman,"The same, you and I!"
230,9,11,Gingers,"Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause dying's lame."
231,9,11,Kyle Broflovski,"You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman."
232,9,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes, but I'm not going to die. [steps forth] That's why we gotta get along, people!"
233,9,11,Gingers,"Hand in hand, we can live together. We shouldn't kill each other 'cause we're all the same."
