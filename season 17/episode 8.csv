0,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"Previously, on South Park."
1,17,8,Narrator,"Now let me tell you, child, of a war that is about to come. [turns out the wall is the two consoles over which the war will be fought - the PS4 and the XBox - and the crow is on the display for the XBox One.] Since time unremembered there have been two. [the crow hops from the XBox One display to the PS4 display] One dark and unforgiving, the other pure and filled with light. [next is a silhouette of a woman looking at South Park Mall from a pile of rocks] At the dawn of war, I stand alone, looking out at would be the last battlefield, for winter is coming, and I... am a princess. [the woman is Princess Kenny] Once a common lady of the dark army, but, denied my right to be called princess by birth, [Kenny hops off the rocks and walks] I've betrayed my kind, [Kenny enters EVGames] and now I have chosen my side: that which I believe is best for all, [Kenny flips through the games and chooses Vomit Cops, then plays it] for it has the dual-shock controller with a speakers and a touchpad interface. [Kenny walks home] Our land is split in two, brother against brother, friend versus friend. [enters his house and walks past his parents] My parents will fight on Black Friday as well. For what? I do not know."
2,17,8,Stuart McCormick,What the hell is he wearin' now?
3,17,8,Narrator,"[walks out to the back yard and sits on her throne] My followers, though few in number, shall help see me through until I am finally accepted as a princess by all. I cannot rest, for I know that even now, the enemy is training for battle, also preparing for winter."
4,17,8,Scott Malkinson,"En garde! [Butters takes up his sword and swordplay resumes. While the crowd cheers the swords-boys on, Cartman is not impressed, and he buries his nose in his hand while squeezing his eyes shut]"
5,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, stop, stop, stop! [leaves his chair and walks up to Scott and Butters] This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! [swings his staff at Scott's mouth and lands it, making Scott's tongue go back in his mouth]"
6,17,8,Scott Malkinson,Aaah God ow sorry...
7,17,8,Eric Cartman,"There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! [leaves]"
8,17,8,Butters Stotch,"[not sure what to do next, then swats Scott on his back] Yeah!"
9,17,8,Scott Malkinson,[falls onto his knees] Ah!
10,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[catches up to Cartman] Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances."
11,17,8,Eric Cartman,"The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training."
12,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday."
13,17,8,Eric Cartman,"That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him! [they go through the sliding door] I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"" [reaches his refrigerator and opens it, looking for something to consume]"
14,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Sony released the PS4s, Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them."
15,17,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around, holding a glass of milk] I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru! [takes a swig of it] Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. [leaves, forgetting to close the refrigerator door]"
16,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Stupid asshole! [looks at a picture of himself and Kenny at Casa Bonita putting their arms around each other, with dreamy expressions, as they used to be best buds. He folds it up and lays it on his desk, face down] Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard. [lost his patience] Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!"
17,17,8,Steve Ballmer's Secretary,"Mr. Ballmer, John and Dave from Marketing are here to see you. [the men come on in]"
18,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Yes, hello. How are things going out there?"
19,17,8,John,"Sir, the tides of war are changing."
20,17,8,Dave,"There's a king in Colorado, a young wizard who believes that Sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid."
21,17,8,John,"He claims that with our help, his followers are prepared to fight to the death over which system is better."
22,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Uhh, what are you guys talking about? You sound ridiculous."
23,17,8,Dave,"[looks at John, then] There's... going to be a war in this small town on Black Friday, and it's all over the news!"
24,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Guys, these are console wars, not some epic battle for a kingdom. I mean, come on."
25,17,8,Dave,"...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping-"
26,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Guys, guys guys! It's just a video game machine, alright? Microsoft's a company that... tries to be above all the petty commercialism, okay?"
27,17,8,Dave,Ok-Okay.
28,17,8,John,Okay. [they turn and leave]
29,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality."
30,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Niles Lawson is on the scene, and Niles, what are you hearing?"
31,17,8,Niles Lawson,"[holding in his left arm a giant candy cane, with blood stains along the hooked end] Tom, tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer Miles ""Happy"" Davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for Black Friday until Thursday night. In honor of the slain mall security officer, the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off Black Friday deals!"
32,17,8,Randy Marsh,Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
33,17,8,Guard 3,[runs up to Randy] Captain! Captain! The mall is dropping the Black Friday sale another 10%.
34,17,8,Guard 4,What?
35,17,8,Guard 5,Oh my God.
36,17,8,Guard 6,They can't do that!
37,17,8,Guard 7,What? That's 90% off!
38,17,8,Guard 8,Oh God! They're back! The shoppers are back! [the camera pulls back to reveal a large crowd of shoppers slowly moving towards the mall. One of them holds a flyer for the new Black Friday deal. The fog is so low it looks soupy]
39,17,8,Randy Marsh,Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. [exits the mall]
40,17,8,Randy Marsh,"[through a bullhorn] If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving."
41,17,8,Shopper 6,We're not on mall property.
42,17,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, you're about to be."
43,17,8,Shopper 6,"Well, what if we just walk really, really slow? [the crowd slows it's walk further, growls spread among them, as they start to resemble a White Walker's] Black Friday!"
44,17,8,Randy Marsh,You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
45,17,8,Shopper 7,We can walk really slow. Look. [the shoppers start to shamble and quietly moan in a full parody of a White Walker army]
46,17,8,Randy Marsh,Smartasses. [turns around and goes inside the mall]
47,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick."
48,17,8,Butters Stotch,"You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?"
49,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him. [picks a rose out for Butters, just as he did for Kenny before.] How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?"
50,17,8,Butters Stotch,They don't!
51,17,8,Eric Cartman,Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
52,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I finished it!"
53,17,8,Eric Cartman,So what happens when the dragons show up?
54,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!"
55,17,8,Eric Cartman,Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
56,17,8,Butters Stotch,Wha-what do you want me to do?
57,17,8,Eric Cartman,Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
58,17,8,Butters Stotch,Who's George R. R. Martin?
59,17,8,Eric Cartman,"He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors."
60,17,8,Homeowner,Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damn yard!
61,17,8,Eric Cartman,[shoots back] Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
62,17,8,Homeowner,"Yeah?! Well how come every time you talk to somebody, it's about betraying somebody else?!"
63,17,8,Eric Cartman,Why don't you mind your own business?!
64,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"No. Listen, for the last time, we don't have any dragons to send them. If some people wanna choose PlayStations, it's their choice. [a knock is heard]"
65,17,8,Steve Ballmer's Secretary,"Sir, Mr. Gates is here."
66,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Bill Gates? [to the caller] Uh, I gotta go. [hangs up, rises from his seat, goes around the desk, and greets Bill Gates] Hey heeey! Bill Gates actually showing up at Corporate."
67,17,8,Bill Gates,"[shaking hands] Hey Steve, how're you doin'?"
68,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Not bad, you know? Just tryin' to get this next gen press stuff handled."
69,17,8,Bill Gates,"I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?"
70,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Oh it's- no, it turns out it was nothing, just some kids tryin' to turn the console wars into somethin' bigger."
71,17,8,Bill Gates,"Oh my gosh. You know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you."
72,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"Yeah, well, nothin' I can't handle. [a man dressed in black appears behind him] There might be some changes we need to make to our marketing, but I'm optimistic. [the man approaches Steve.]"
73,17,8,Bill Gates,Uh huh.
74,17,8,Steve Ballmer,"You know, I think we'll ultimately sell the number of units we want to. [the man takes out a dagger and gets closer]"
75,17,8,Bill Gates,"You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made. [the hitman reaches around and stabs Ballmer through the chest and drags the dagger to the right, cutting open Ballmer's chest even more. Ballmer cries out, but is choking in his blood. Ballmer steps backwards and falls on his back gasping for air. Gates takes a glass of wine to a sofa and sits down to look at Ballmer] Do you know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve. [Ballmer takes his last gasps as Gates walks out of the CEO's office. Gates addresses Ballmer's men] Clean that shit up."
76,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Well come on, Scott. You're lagging."
77,17,8,Scott Malkinson,I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
78,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. [Butters and Scott stand in front of a mansion gate somewhere in the Southwest. Cacti abound on either side of the high fence. Butters reaches up and presses a buzzer]"
79,17,8,Butler,[through the intercom] Can I help you?
80,17,8,Butters Stotch,Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
81,17,8,Butler,"Who is this, please?"
82,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up? [two seconds of silence] Hello?"
83,17,8,Butler,"I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans."
84,17,8,Butters Stotch,We're not fans!
85,17,8,Scott Malkinson,"Yeah, we don't like it!"
86,17,8,Butters Stotch,"We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!"
87,17,8,Butler,About what?
88,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! [the buzzer sounds again and the gates open. Butters and Scott go inside and towards the front door. George R. R. Martin steps outside to greet them]"
89,17,8,GRRM,"It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?"
90,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up."
91,17,8,GRRM,Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.
92,17,8,Butters Stotch,When?
93,17,8,GRRM,You really wanna know?
94,17,8,Butters Stotch,[sternly] Please. It's urgent.
95,17,8,GRRM,"Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight."
96,17,8,Butters Stotch,"No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?"
97,17,8,Scott Malkinson,"Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint."
98,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh what's the matter, Scott?"
99,17,8,Scott Malkinson,I told you I have to eat every two hours.
100,17,8,Butters Stotch,He's diabetic.
101,17,8,GRRM,"Oh Jeez, uh, why don't you kids come out from the cold? I'll order some pizzas."
102,17,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh. Okay, thanks."
103,17,8,GRRM,Come on in! I'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in Game of Thrones. [leads the boys inside]
104,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan."
105,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong."
106,17,8,Eric Cartman,"It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army [picks a rose out for Kyle], but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation. [Kyle sniffs the rose] It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be... [stops] grounded?"
107,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,Grounded? For what?
108,17,8,Eric Cartman,That could be up to you.
109,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!"
110,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right. [begins walking] Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?"
111,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
112,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Seems a little convenient, doesn't it? [stops and faces Kyle] Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors."
113,17,8,Homeowner,Don't believe it! [Cartman and Kyle look at the homeowner] He said that to a bunch of people!
114,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!"
115,17,8,Homeowner,You're callin' the cops?!
116,17,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
117,17,8,Homeowner,You're on my property! I'm callin' the cops!
118,17,8,Eric Cartman,Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
119,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"[startled] Oh oh! [calms down] Oh, it's you."
120,17,8,Niles Lawson,"Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report."
121,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,We don't go to work for another hour.
122,17,8,Niles Lawson,[walks to the foot of the bed] We just got a call from Bill Gates. [sits down] He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday if we play along.
123,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,He wants us to side with him?
124,17,8,Niles Lawson,"That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better."
125,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!"
126,17,8,Niles Lawson,"Right, Tom. Because you're sooo about integrity. Let's go. [stands up and walks to the doorway, then turns around] Or maybe I should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to! Back to you!"
127,17,8,9 News Announcer,"It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson. Colorado's top-rated brother-sister news team."
128,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there."
129,17,8,Tom and Tammy Thompson,"That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise."
130,17,8,Niles Lawson,"Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking, and none other than Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger. [Bill Gates appears]"
131,17,8,Bill Gates,"That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers."
132,17,8,Niles Lawson,We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.
133,17,8,Bill Gates,"Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety."
134,17,8,Mrs McCormick,[answers the door] Yes?
135,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Hi, is Kenny home?"
136,17,8,Mrs McCormick,"Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends."
137,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Forward, men! [the bearers try to fit Cartman through the door, but they can't fir through. First they run into the door frame on the left side] That, no- [then on the right] No, you- You've gotta turn me. [the bearers tilt the litter some seventy degrees without Cartman falling off and finally fit through the door.]"
138,17,8,Jimmy Valmer,It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! [other soldiers rally]
139,17,8,Other kids,Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!
140,17,8,Eric Cartman,"I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?"
141,17,8,Stan Marsh,Let them pass! [the PS4 army makes way for the XBox army. Cartman is carried over to Kenny's throne]
142,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)"
143,17,8,Stan Marsh,[translating] The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
144,17,8,Eric Cartman,"You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday."
145,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)"
146,17,8,Stan Marsh,"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it."
147,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!"
148,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"(What?!) [fans himself] (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)"
149,17,8,Stan Marsh,The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
150,17,8,Eric Cartman,That doesn't even make sense.
151,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps forward] Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control."
152,17,8,Stan Marsh,What I started? How dare you!
153,17,8,Kyle Broflovski,All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
154,17,8,Stan Marsh,"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!"
155,17,8,Eric Cartman,"You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! [Stan and Kenny look at each other, then Stan thinks a minute]"
156,17,8,Stan Marsh,The gods will find us a way!
157,17,8,GRRM,"So then Samwell Tarly sees the army approaching, and his wiener is about this big. [about 18 inches, by his estimate. Butters is losing patience as Scott fades] He knows that Stannis Baratheon's wiener is probably shriveled from the cold. Samwell has to rally his men, so what does he do? He takes out his wiener [unzips his pants and demonstrates his story] and he dangles it around for all his men to see. [shakes his hips and pretends his wiener is a bell]"
158,17,8,Scott Malkinson,AAAH! [turns away for a moment]
159,17,8,Butters Stotch,"OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!"
160,17,8,GRRM,"Yeah yeah, they're on their way. They're still coming. So Samwell's wiener goes [shakes his hips around as if his wiener were a bell and makes sounds for it]"
161,17,8,Butters Stotch,But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! [Scott had said he needs to eat every two hours]
162,17,8,Scott Malkinson,"If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out."
163,17,8,GRRM,"[zips up] Don't worry. They're coming. Pizzas are on their way. They're gonna be amazing. [picks up where he was interrupted] Now, John Snow finally faces Jaime Lannister, and this guy's wiener is, you know, huge, right? So it's not goin' to be easy."
164,17,8,Scott Malkinson,Ehhh...
165,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday."
166,17,8,Bill Gates,"Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?"
167,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help. [picks another yellow rose for Gates] But I hope that we're clear that this is my army. [hands the rose to him. Gates sniffs it] There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules."
168,17,8,Bill Gates,"Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want."
169,17,8,Eric Cartman,Your CEOs?
170,17,8,Bill Gates,"Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors."
171,17,8,Eric Cartman,"Uhhh, hmmm. What?"
172,17,8,Homeowner,[from his bedroom window] Hahaa! How's it feel?! Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?!
173,17,8,Eric Cartman,Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
174,17,8,Homeowner,Why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard?! [slams his window shut]
175,17,8,President of Sony,"Ish, ish, ish, o-ish, haishooo! [quickly sits up to deliver the final thrust, then collapses onto his bed. He then rolls over on his back, revealing whom he was having sex with]"
176,17,8,Niles Lawson,[with mic in hand] That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely. How about you?
177,17,8,President of Sony,"[gets a cigarette and lights it.] Tanoshikatta ne. (Yeah, it was fun.)"
178,17,8,Niles Lawson,"You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided."
179,17,8,President of Sony,"Eh? Nani kore, tsukareta yo. (What? I'm tired!)"
180,17,8,Niles Lawson,Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.
181,17,8,President of Sony,"Hai. [""Yes."" He reaches over to his left and grabs a box] Kore ga arimasu. [""Here it is"" He opens the box and something begins to glow inside]"
182,17,8,Niles Lawson,"[leans in to see what it is] Yes, I think that will do nicely."
183,17,8,Chorus,"[Classical men's ensemble singing in musical round style, as GRRM conducts.]
'Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener [continues in background]"
184,17,8,Soloist,"One wiener, next to another wiener"
185,17,8,Chorus,"Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener [continues in background]"
186,17,8,Soloist,Two wieners alongside yet another wiener

210,17,8,Craig Tucker,"Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess."
211,17,8,Kenny McCormick (and his narrator),"(Wooo!) [as J-pop music plays, Kenny's backyard is transformed. The makeshift thrown becomes a gazebo with a unicorn bust on top, Kenny gets a magical girl look, with big anime eyes, and gets the power of the rainbow, with bubbles, etc. He gets a pet unicorn. The whole scene could be an intro for a Princess Kenny show.]"
212,17,8,Guard 9,Oh God. We're done for!
213,17,8,Randy Marsh,"My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us. [his phone rings and he picks up] Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!"

215,17,8,Crowd,[turns and looks at him] What?
216,17,8,Niles Lawson,"The genius idea was proposed by George R. R. Martin, who also suggested ""Fuck it, let's push Thanksgiving to December 3rd."" For pushing the date, the mall is now reducing Black Friday prices to 96% off to the first hundred people inside the mall! [the shoppers begin to fight each other] This is going to be a fucking bloodbath, Tom. There will be medical tents, ambulances, face-painting, no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die! [an elderly man holding up a 96% off flier lets out a dragon's roar]"
