0,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[walks in] Hey, everyone? Excuse me! [the other kids start to turn towards him] Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up. [finally has everyone's attention] Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle."
1,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,About what?!
2,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller? [a ginger boy with dark red hair leans to his left for a better view] Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology."
3,17,6,Craig Tucker,Where did you find a red-haired cow?
4,17,6,Eric Cartman,[crosses his right arm over his chest and points to the doors behind his left shoulder] Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
5,17,6,Eric Cartman,"There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. [The camera turns right and stops at a cow with a Jewfro, glasses, a freckled face, and huge red polka dots on her body. Cartman laughs at his cleverness]"
6,17,6,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, look at it!"
7,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[giggling to himself] You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!"
8,17,6,Craig Tucker,"[takes out his phone and starts taking pictures] Wow, that's pretty trippy."
9,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it! [Butters and Kevin take their phones out...] I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! [Jimmy takes out his phone...]"
10,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Cartman, joke's over. [Kenny takes out his phone]"
11,17,6,Eric Cartman,What? What joke? This is real!
12,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
13,17,6,Eric Cartman,"No, [drops down to the ground] no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong."
14,17,6,Butters Stotch,"Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake."
15,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Butters! [laughs to himself]"
16,17,6,Craig Tucker,"I gotta show this to my mom! [leaves, and the other kids disperse]"
17,17,6,Butters Stotch,Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! [leaves. Only Kyle remains with Cartman]
18,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good."
19,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
20,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. [walks away]"
21,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?"
22,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
23,17,6,Mr Mackey,Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
24,17,6,Butters Stotch,"Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?"
25,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Nothing. [hops off his chair to leave the classroom]
26,17,6,Butters Stotch,Busted!
27,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle."
28,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Wuwhat's going on?
29,17,6,Principal Victoria,"Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator."
30,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[glances at the rabbis again] I don't speak Hebrew.
31,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important. [to the rabbis, in bad English] This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.[Kyle looks at the rabbis]"
32,17,6,Rabbi 1,[sighs] We're just trying to tell them that we come on very urgent business. [Kyle looks back at Mr. Mackey]
33,17,6,Mr Mackey,Anything?
34,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,He said they come on urgent business.
35,17,6,Principal Victoria,"Ohh, what does he need?"
36,17,6,Rabbi 2,"Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!"
37,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!"
38,17,6,Principal Victoria,"For what? What did he say, Kyle?"
39,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Please, you must understand! The fate of the world is at stake! [walks to his right and walks over to the window] The coming of a red heifer is the nost holy sign in all of Judaism. It signals the beginning of the End. It is not just our religion, but Islam and Christianity as well. They all agree on one thing. [turns around] That the red heifer means the End of Times."
40,17,6,Mr Mackey,"You catch any of that, Kyle? [Kyle looks at Mr. Mackey in disbelief]"
41,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's right over here by uh-
42,17,6,Rabbi 2,Oh my holy shmear! [a group of Muslims is already bowing down to the cow. One of them notices him and tells him to get out. (!??? ?????)]
43,17,6,Rabbi 2,The Muslims! They beat us here! [hops the fence and charges at them. The other two follow suit.]
44,17,6,Mr Mackey,"[frantic] What's goin' on, Kyle??"
45,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,He said the Muslims beat them here- [to himself] God damn it!
46,17,6,Rabbi 2,[arrives next to the cow] Step away! You all know what this means!
47,17,6,Cleric 1,Yes! And you know you are about to die!
48,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
49,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Don't touch it! [they all surround the cow, keeping Kyle and each other away from it]"
50,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[to a reporter] Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."""
51,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[trying to reach Cartman, but trapped by the crowd] Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!"
52,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. [chuckles loudly]"
53,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,NOOOO!
54,17,6,Rabbi 4,"[arrives with a sheet of paper, and Rabbi 2 looks at it] The Muslims and the Christians are calling for a meeting to discuss the terms of war."
55,17,6,Rabbi 2,"Very well, let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends."
56,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Alright, so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles, no shanks, and no chemical weapons."
57,17,6,Cleric 2,"If there can be no chemical weapons, then the Christians can use no nuclear weapons. [clamoring follows]"
58,17,6,Bishop,"Come on, without nuclear weapons, what kind of final Armageddon is this gonna be?! [clamoring follows]"
59,17,6,Rabbi 3,But couldn't we agree on non-ballistic nuclear weapons only?
60,17,6,Bishop,"Yeah, I suppose that's fine."
61,17,6,Cleric 2,That makes sense.
62,17,6,Rabbi 1,Non-ballistic nuclear only. Alright. Now on to prisoners. Are we all agreeing to decapitations?
63,17,6,Israeli,Of course we are! What do you think this is?!
64,17,6,Others,"Yeah, come on! Just get to it!"
65,17,6,Cleric 3,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! Has anyone noticed something? We are all in a room together. Talking. [walks to the front of the crowd] Has it occurred to anyone else that this prophecy, which amazingly is in all three religions, could actually be meant to bring us together?"
66,17,6,Bishop,[walks up to him] The prophecy says the red heifer signals the End. [joins him] Could it mean the end of... war?
67,17,6,Rabbi 1,"If the cow is sacrificed in Israel according to the prophecy, then perhaps it could bring about peace."
68,17,6,Anderson Cooper,"After all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the Middle East. In the past 48 hours, Jews, Muslims, and Christians have met in Israel to sort out their differences. It may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. And all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the U.S. [the doorbell rings and Kyle goes to answer it]We'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this. [Kyle opens the door and sees that it's Cartman]"
69,17,6,Eric Cartman,Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
70,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. [Cartman enters and Kyle closes the door]
71,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up."
72,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,No shit!
73,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it."
74,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
75,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[shakes his head] No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!"
76,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!"
77,17,6,Eric Cartman,"But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank? [no reply] Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie."
78,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, go to Hell!"
79,17,6,Eric Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! [picks up the house phone and starts punching]"
80,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Wwwait. [Cartman stops]
81,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Mom?
82,17,6,Sheila Broflovski,Hi bubbe.
83,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you."
84,17,6,Sheila Broflovski,"What is it, Kyle?"
85,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks down and to his right] You're a fat skank, Mom. [shuts his eyes. Sheila is shocked]"
86,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[gasps loudly] Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??"
87,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. [turns and walks out. Cartman's jaw drops.]"
88,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Ohh my God! [whips out his camera phone and feigns concern] Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?"
89,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[reaching his locker] Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. [opens his locker and puts a book on top of the stack. Stan, at his neighboring locker, notices]"
90,17,6,Stan Marsh,How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
91,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I just... thought it'd be nice.
92,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[puts another book on the stack] Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework, [puts a third book on the stack] gave me the soda from his lunch. [removes the second and third books he just placed on the stack] I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East. [places the third book back on the stack] Right, Kyle? [puts the second book back in the locker]"
93,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes sir.
94,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?"
95,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes. [sets Cartman's books and backpack on the floor, then walks to the middle of the hallway] I love Cartman's farts."
96,17,6,Eric Cartman,You what??
97,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
98,17,6,Craig Tucker,"Dude, what the hell are you talking about?"
99,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
100,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to him] Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle. [Kyle does so, and Cartman backs up onto Kyle's face] Let's see what I can muster up here."
101,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
102,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Let's see. Oh! Oh! [farts, then gets off Kyle]"
103,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[stands up] Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. [turns aroundn and walks away. Cartman smiles. Stan and Kenny can't believe it]
104,17,6,Stan Marsh,[enunciating] What the fuck?
105,17,6,Mr Mackey,Come on in.
106,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[opens the door and walks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?"
107,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Wuh sure, Kyle. What's the matter?"
108,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?"
109,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?"
110,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[rubs his tears away] Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it. [Cartman sneaks a peek around the open door] I love it sooo sooo much.
111,17,6,Mr Mackey,Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
112,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Because they taste so yummy. [his voice quivers]
113,17,6,Mr Mackey,"Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that."
114,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[enters and clears his throat] Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?"
115,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
116,17,6,Eric Cartman,"[small gasp] Kyle, are you sure?"
117,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Please...
118,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Well alright. [farts into his left hand and cups it over Kyle's mouth, making sure the fart goes all the way in.]"
119,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy.
120,17,6,Mr Mackey,Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
121,17,6,Bishop,"Today... begins the new Israel. [the cleric lifts up a cow bell and rings it, then sets it down] Today, we are all united as one. [the rabbi lights the candle] Chakam balada."
122,17,6,Crowd,Chakam balada! Chakam balada! [followed by lots of cheering]
123,17,6,Rabbi 3,"Now, let us celebrate under one symbol! [the clergy go their separate ways and the table sinks into the stage. After several peals of the bell, the floot the table was on returns to the stage as the three religious symbols combine to form... the Van Halen logo. Van Halen's music comes on and the stage lights go on. Eddie Van Halen takes the stage, followed by the rest of Van Halen, with David Lee Roth on mic]"
124,17,6,Rabbi,No way no waaay!
125,17,6,Muslim,Epiiic!
126,17,6,David Lee Roth,"Hello Israel! [launches into ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love""]"
127,17,6,CNN Reporter,"The party is officially underway. Jews, Christians and Muslims have united, ushering ten years of Van Halen. [archived live footage follows] Out in the crowd, people are celebrating like never before. [nineteen seconds of footage and song follow] No doubt Israel is the happiest, rockingest place to be."
128,17,6,Stan Marsh,Hey Kyle.
129,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hey
130,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too."
131,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled."
132,17,6,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?"
133,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[gets emotional] I just do, Stan."
134,17,6,Stan Marsh,You like... how they smell? How they taste?
135,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
136,17,6,Stan Marsh,They're really that good?
137,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
138,17,6,Stan Marsh,Should I try them?
139,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,NO.
140,17,6,Ringtone,Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.
141,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,This is Cartman. I have to take it. [answers his phone] Hello?
142,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?"
143,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[keeping quite calm] I don't care.
144,17,6,Eric Cartman,"I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?"
145,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,That's fine. [hangs up]
146,17,6,Stan Marsh,"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help."
147,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be."
148,17,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't get it, Kenny."
149,17,6,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)"
150,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head."
151,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. [begins to reject Cartman's farts in his dreams. A bright light appears and Kyle wakes up, then looks at the foot of his bed]"
152,17,6,Spirit,Kyle Broflovski.
153,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Huh? Who...? Who is that?
154,17,6,Spirit,"Why do you endure all the farts, Kyle?"
155,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
156,17,6,Spirit,What you are doing... is the most awesome thing ever.
157,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I... I know.
158,17,6,Spirit,Who else would take such torment?
159,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking."
160,17,6,Spirit,"You should like, shave your head and get all peaceful about it. Your sacrifice saves the world."
161,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes.
162,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
163,17,6,CNN Reporter,"[now in party mode - shirtless and with face paint on] What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks! Things just keep getting better here, Tom. And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow, here on stage, and things are gonna go off!"
164,17,6,Eric Cartman,"You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? [three quick farts]"
165,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes! Yes I will!
166,17,6,Eric Cartman,Huh? You comin'? [three more quick ones]
167,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, whatever you want. [a longer fart]"
168,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. [leaves, screen right. Kyle stands up]"
169,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world."
170,17,6,Butters Stotch,"Just stop, please."
171,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[dressed in gray pants and white tunic, no footwear] It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. [walks away, screen left]"
172,17,6,Craig Tucker,Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
173,17,6,Stan Marsh,Hey Kyle.
174,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello, Stan."
175,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop."
176,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,There are greater things at work than what you understand.
177,17,6,Stan Marsh,"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it."
178,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,I'm actually the complete opposite.
179,17,6,Stan Marsh,All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
180,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place."
181,17,6,Stan Marsh,See? You sound like a dick.
182,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,[thinks a bit] I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
183,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick."
184,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!"
185,17,6,Stan Marsh,I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
186,17,6,Kenny McCormick,(Huh? Like what?)
187,17,6,Stan Marsh,"This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!"
188,17,6,Rabbi 1,"And now, let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen, Eric Cartman, and his best friend, Fartboy. [Cartman and Kyle come out onstage to great applause. The rabbi gives Cartman the mic]"
189,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?"
190,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
191,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip."
192,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
193,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Uh excuse me, I'm sorry everyone, but apparently there's some breaking news in the United States."
194,17,6,Reporter,"We are in Colorado where the red cow was discovered, and apparently, two boys have shocking news that might change everything."
195,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been [Stan's phone rings] So- sorry, hang on. [pulls the phone out of his jacket pocket and answers it.] Hello?"
196,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Do not do this!
197,17,6,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!"
198,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!"
199,17,6,Stan Marsh,Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
200,17,6,Muslim 2,"""Oh"" what? [an Israeli throws up his hands in a shrug]"
201,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!"
202,17,6,Stan Marsh,"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!"
203,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!"
204,17,6,Stan Marsh,"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"""
205,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry."
206,17,6,Stan Marsh,You should apologize to Kenny too.
207,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Kenny!"
208,17,6,Kenny McCormick,"(That's okay, Kyle.)"
209,17,6,Rabbi 1,"No, what is the new information?!"
210,17,6,Stan Marsh,The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
211,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Hurray!
212,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Oh no, it was a miracle?"
213,17,6,Israeli 2,"Then, it's not true. The prophecy is not true! [rounds of disappointment as everyone starts leaving]"
214,17,6,David Lee Roth,"Wait, I thought we were all here because of the prophecy of a miraculous red cow!"
215,17,6,Rabbi 5,"No, the prophecy is that one day, a fat child with a small penis would decorate a cow to look ginger, not that one would miraculously just fall from the sky. [Kyle is stunned that Cartman fulfilled that prophecy]"
216,17,6,Muslim 2,I knew this was all too good to be true!
217,17,6,Bishop,We are associating with these heathens for no reason!
218,17,6,Eric Cartman,Small penis?!
219,17,6,Anchor,"The party's over. Muslims, Jews, and Christians are back at each other's throats, and Israel is once again a place of conflict, and turmoil"
220,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!"
221,17,6,Rabbi 3,No it di'n't.
222,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yes! It did!
223,17,6,Rabbi 1,The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.
224,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!"
225,17,6,Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems."
226,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,But it's the truth!
227,17,6,Eric Cartman,"No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick."
228,17,6,Rabbi 1,"Sorry boys, but we've gotta get to our fight. There's a rumble at the Wailing Wall. [brings out a switchblade. Rabbi 2 has a shot gun, while rabbi 3 carries a bat]. They leave, and Kyle turns around"
229,17,6,Kyle Broflovski,Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
230,17,6,Eric Cartman,"Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? [puts his hand on his ass and farts on it, then puts whipped cream on it, with a cherry on top, and smothers it on Kyle's face. He then walks away. A few seconds later, the cherry falls off]"
