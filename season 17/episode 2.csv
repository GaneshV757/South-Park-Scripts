0,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,[reading from her yellow index cards] Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
1,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Boooo! [Wendy looks up and gets angry] Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!"
2,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,[returns to her report] Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
3,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy."
4,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[returns to her report, with her voice clearly getting more annoyed and explicit] The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-"
5,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo! [Wendy lowers her report down to her sidee-] Boo Wendy! Liar!"
6,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!"
7,17,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo."
8,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please? [no reaction - he's rather engrossed in the book he's reading] Mr. Garrison?!"
9,17,2,Mr Garrison,"[startled] Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report, [Wendy looks betrayed] let's have uh, Peter Mullen."
10,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[extremely annoyed, goes to her seat] Ugh, Jesus! [Peter walks up and takes her place]"
11,17,2,Peter Mullen,My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes! [whips out a remote control box and presses a button. A projector screen comes down behind him] Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide! [the screen stops] I'm talking of course about [presses another button and the first image comes up. It's an Investigation Discovery screenshot] murder porn!
12,17,2,Butters Stotch,Murder porn?
13,17,2,Eric Cartman,That's more like it.
14,17,2,Peter Mullen,"According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like ""Cold Case Files,"" ""Dateline: Murder,"" and ""Deadly Affairs"" is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like ""Southern Fried Homicide,"" ""Sinful Secrets,"" ""On The Case with Paula Zahn."" And it's all smut and it's garbage and it's [throws down his index cards] trash! [a few seconds later he clears his throat and gathers up his index cards] Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, ""If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?"" [the class is speechless with mouths open. Only Cartman claps]"
15,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud. [some low rumbles are heard] Come on it. [Stan goes in. Randy is in his most relaxed pose in bed] Oh hey Stan, what's up? [Stan looks at the TV screen to his right]"
16,17,2,Narrator,"His wife is having sex with the neighbor. [a couple going at it in bed] And when her husband comes home, [the husband opens the bedroom door, the couple notices and stops.] he wants more than just a divorce. [the husband raises his gun and kills the boyfriend, than the wife. Sharon picks up the remote and switches channels]"
17,17,2,Stan Marsh,You guys are watchin' murder porn?
18,17,2,Randy Marsh,"...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show."
19,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Uh adults like documentaries.
20,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff."
21,17,2,Stan Marsh,Okaaay. [turns around and walks out. Sharon switches back to the show]
22,17,2,Randy Marsh,Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
23,17,2,Stan Marsh,What's up dude?
24,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?"
25,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Yhh, yeah, the first grader?"
26,17,2,Eric Cartman,You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
27,17,2,Stan Marsh,...What?!
28,17,2,Sergeant Yates,"Hey that kid should not be seeing this! [Aaron is still crying in despair, while  an officer drops a blanket over him so he can't see]"
29,17,2,Stan Marsh,What happened?
30,17,2,Dad,"You're making a mistake! [he is naked and covered with blood, two officers haul him towards a police cruiser, while he struggles] Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! [the officers put him in and close the back door. The boys don't believe what they've just seen]"
31,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!"
32,17,2,Red,How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!
33,17,2,Clyde Donovan,The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
34,17,2,Butters Stotch,"I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!"
35,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
36,17,2,Eric Cartman,Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
37,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know."
38,17,2,Narrator,"Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals. [a man and woman kiss. He holds a wedding ring in one hand, and a knife in the other] Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits, [a couple kisses on the front porch, then the girlfriend shots her man point blank in the forehead, smiling] on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder, [another couple. The girl stabs the guy through the left eye] on Hot Load Case Files. [a woman is ready to unload on her man and the two other women he's in bed with]"
39,17,2,Randy Marsh,Oh yeah! [he and Sharon strip down] Three of the best shows in a row!
40,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Is the lube over there?
41,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I got lube right here."
42,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"Well get over here, big guy."
43,17,2,Randy Marsh,Yeah-hah! [he moves over to her and they start making out. He leaves the lube near the edge of the bed. A three-tone chime is heard. Randy looks over and reads the screen]
44,17,2,Randy Marsh,"What the? [sits up. The lube falls off the bed] What the hell? [tries to change channels, but they all say the same thing. Moments later he's on the phone with his cable service.] Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says ""How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?"" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?"
45,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Stan. Stan! [Stan wakes up, his eyes half-closed] How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?"
46,17,2,Stan Marsh,[miffed] What?
47,17,2,Randy Marsh,What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
48,17,2,Stan Marsh,You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. [closes his eyes]
49,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid! [thinking a bit. Stan opens his eyes] I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot! [Stan closes his eyes again] Stan? [Stan opens his eyes] You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! [goes back to his room. Stan rolls his eyes and goes back to sleep]"
50,17,2,Stephen Stotch,Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
51,17,2,Mrs Tweak,How are they able to do this with their smartphones?
52,17,2,Randy Marsh,"It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company! [Stuart returns from a meeting with the cable company] What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?"
53,17,2,Stuart McCormick,"No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround."
54,17,2,Randy Marsh,"What?! We'll see about this! [storms into the office] Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!"
55,17,2,Cable Guy,"I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company. [tauntingly] Ohhh there's not another cable company, is there? [begins to rub his nipples in circles] Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town."
56,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!"
57,17,2,Cable Guy,"As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box."
58,17,2,Randy Marsh,"[relieved somewhat] Oh. Well okay, great."
59,17,2,Cable Guy,[begins to process the request on his computer] We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?
60,17,2,Randy Marsh,"NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!"
61,17,2,Cable Guy,"[begins to taunt again] Oh, you can't? [begins rubbing his nipples through his shirt] Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV?"
62,17,2,Randy Marsh,I can't afford DirecTV.
63,17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh, you can't? [rips off some patches covering his nipples off his shirt and begins rubbing his nipples directly] Jeez, that's terrible. Then I guess you just have to work within our time windows. [squeezes his nipples. Randy just glares at him and walks out]"
64,17,2,Stephen Stotch,Well? Any luck?
65,17,2,Randy Marsh,"No, just the usual cable-company stuff."
66,17,2,Mrs Tweak,"Oh well, guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama."
67,17,2,Stephen Stotch,"No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?"
68,17,2,Randy Marsh,"I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off."
69,17,2,Stephen Stotch,"We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price."
70,17,2,Boy,Hello?
71,17,2,Randy Marsh,Hi. Corey Lanskin?
72,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Yes?
73,17,2,Randy Marsh,We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
74,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Fuck off! [shuts the door on Randy. The adults are stunned and look at each other. Randy knocks on the door again, twice. Corey answers the door again, still suspicious]"
75,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!"
76,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!"
77,17,2,Randy Marsh,We have a hundred ounces of silver. [Stuart leans to his left a bit and shows off a box]
78,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"[looks right, then left, and talks in a serious British accent] Wipe your feet and turn off your cell phones. [goes inside. Randy looks back at the other adults, then wipes his shoes off on the welcome mat and goes in. The other adults wipe their shoes off and go on in.]"
79,17,2,Corey Lanskin,[pacing back and forth between the tables explaining the game] Next we're going to select an empty world. Selecting an empty world will begin with you being dropped onto a beach. Now you're free to roam around and start punching trees!
80,17,2,Gerald Broflovski,Punching trees?
81,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Why, why would we punch trees?"
82,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Just use your fucking brain! How do you get wood? [Randy isn't sure] 'Ow do you get wood?!
83,17,2,Randy Marsh,[nervously] Watching informative murder porn?
84,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!"
85,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Puh, punching trees?"
86,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin."
87,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh, I see. So when does the game start?"
88,17,2,Corey Lanskin,You are playing the game; this is the game!
89,17,2,Randy Marsh,...I don't get it.
90,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!"
91,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Yes ah, I'm getting it now."
92,17,2,Gerald Broflovski,You are?
93,17,2,Randy Marsh,No.
94,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep."
95,17,2,Randy Marsh,"[at his computer playing away] I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one."
96,17,2,Sharon Marsh,I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
97,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond."
98,17,2,Sharon Marsh,We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
99,17,2,Randy Marsh,"No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?"
100,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"[settling in] Well I'm going to sleep, Randy."
101,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back."
102,17,2,Jimmy Valmer,There he is. Hey Kyle! [arrives with Craig and Tweek] The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
103,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,What? How do you know?
104,17,2,Tweek Tweak,I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
105,17,2,Craig Tucker,It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
106,17,2,Stan Marsh,That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
107,17,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys? [Stan and Kyle turn to face him. He's at the end of the hall] You guys, you'd better get over here."
108,17,2,Stan Marsh,What?
109,17,2,Eric Cartman,Butters' dad killed his mom. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in disbelief]
110,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Butters, what happened?"
111,17,2,Butters Stotch,"[through his tears] I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell!"
112,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?"
113,17,2,Butters Stotch,Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well! [Mr. Mackey happens along] I was trapped down there all night!
114,17,2,Mr Mackey,"Butters, your dad threw you down a well?"
115,17,2,Stan Marsh,In Minecraft.
116,17,2,Mr Mackey,Well what the hell is that?
117,17,2,Butters Stotch,I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
118,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,[turns left] That's it. [walks a bit] That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
119,17,2,Stan Marsh,Whattaya mean?
120,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. [dramatic flourish]
121,17,2,Randy Marsh,Yes?
122,17,2,Officer 1,"Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?"
123,17,2,Randy Marsh,"No, what happened?"
124,17,2,Officer 1,"Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees."
125,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Punched his trees, huh?"
126,17,2,Officer 1,Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
127,17,2,Randy Marsh,Huh. [puts his hands on his hips] That's weird.
128,17,2,Officer 1,What were you doing last night?
129,17,2,Randy Marsh,I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
130,17,2,Officer 2,I play the banjo too.
131,17,2,Officer 1,"Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well."
132,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Will do, officer. Will... do... [the officers turn and leave]"
133,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!"
134,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! [the kids clamor for a few seconds]"
135,17,2,Craig Tucker,"I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!"
136,17,2,Clyde Donovan,Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
137,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
138,17,2,Eric Cartman,"And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!"
139,17,2,Wendy Testaburger,I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
140,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo."
141,17,2,Stan Marsh,"It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. [police sirens are heard]"
142,17,2,Officer 3,"All right, that's enough. Come on out and there won't be any trouble. [the kids pour out of the rec center and into some bright spotlights.] Give it up, Stotch. You've nowhere to run."
143,17,2,Butters Stotch,Huh?
144,17,2,Stephen Stotch,"I'll never give up! [the kids look up, and the next camera shows a makeshift castle built over the rec center, made of blocks of wood with pictures all over them] I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!"
145,17,2,Randy Marsh,"[steps forward carrying a large hammer] Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!"
146,17,2,Stephen Stotch,"Aw, go to hell, you griefer!"
147,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Alright, we've gotta do something."
148,17,2,Corey Lanskin,[in a trembling voice] Hello?
149,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,Corey Lanskin?
150,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Eh yes?
151,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
152,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"[sucks on his lollipop] Whaaa? What's a, what's a ""Minequaf""?"
153,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!"
154,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. ""Get back in the meat locker!"" ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"" But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?"
155,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house."
156,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Ohhhkay. [goes back inside] Bye. [closes the door. The boys turn around and leave, but Cartman stops on the walkway. A few seconds later the other three boys return]"
157,17,2,Stan Marsh,"What, dude?"
158,17,2,Eric Cartman,"Something he said. Did you hear him? He said ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"""
159,17,2,Stan Marsh,So?
160,17,2,Eric Cartman,"You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said."
161,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Now that you've built a workbench it's time to build somethin' that will take care of all those fuckin' sheep! [the boys have found the basement and come down the stairs] Just stop thinkin' with your grown-up brains and start usin' your-
162,17,2,Stan Marsh,Aha! [the boys reach the floor]
163,17,2,Corey Lanskin,Oh shit! [the adults quickly leave]
164,17,2,Kenny McCormick,(I knew you're up to something!)
165,17,2,Eric Cartman,Son of a bitch! [grabs Corey by the collar] Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
166,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Kids gotta find some way to make a livin', don't 'e?"
167,17,2,Stan Marsh,"You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!"
168,17,2,Corey Lanskin,What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?
169,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,So you know it.
170,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Yeah, I've seen that stuff. [Cartman releases him] ""'Oo The Bleep Did I Marry?"", ""True Crime with Aphrodite Jones"". Real sick shit. Your parents watch that stuff?"
171,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft."
172,17,2,Corey Lanskin,"Your problem ain't with me, mates. Sure, one or two people might act out what they see in video games, but cable television? [takes out a cigarette and lighter and lights up the cigarette, then starts smoking.] People copy everything they see people do on cable. You're goin' about this all wrong. You wanna protect your family? You're gonna have to go fight the cable company."
173,17,2,Cable Guy,"Hey guys, can I help you?"
174,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please."
175,17,2,Cable Guy,"[taunting] Ohhh, you don't want cable anymore?"
176,17,2,Stan Marsh,"No no, [whips out a list and reads it] just ID Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn."
177,17,2,Cable Guy,"You don't like paying for all the channels? [begins rubbing his nipples through his shirt] Ohh, our company actually packages channels together."
178,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?"
179,17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way. [lowers his hands as if to look up something] You want me to give you the number of a different cable company that can- [goes back to rubbing his nipples] Oh wait, we're it, aren't we? [rips off the patches and rubs his nipples again] Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages."
180,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
181,17,2,Cable Guy,"Oh, sure. Hey David?"
182,17,2,David,"[arrives] Hi, is there a problem here? [rips off the patches on his shirt and prepares to rub]"
183,17,2,Stan Marsh,We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
184,17,2,David,[taunting. Both men are now rubbing their nipples] Ohhh you have to pay for the bundle. You can't just pay for what you wanna watch. Darn it.
185,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
186,17,2,Cable Guy,"I guess if you don't wanna be [lowers his left hand from his nipple so that David starts rubbing it with his right hand. He in turn begins to rub David's right nipple with his left hand] forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether."
187,17,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Fine, [folds his arms over his chest] then we'll shut our cable off altogether!"
188,17,2,David,Hey Mitch? When can you get out to shut off some cable boxes?
189,17,2,"Cable Guy, David, and Mitch","[at his office rubbing his nipples] Oh man, it's gonna be like three weeks. There's a whole plug I have to pull out; it's like four inches long."
190,17,2,David,"[now rubbing both of the cable guy's nipples, while the cable guy rubs his left nipple now] Three weeks, huh? Okay, is three weeks from now okay with you guys?"
191,17,2,Stan Marsh,"No, that's way too long!"
192,17,2,Cable Guy,Oh it is?
193,17,2,David,"Oh Jeez, that's terrible."
194,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other! [the men stop rubbing] Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?"
195,17,2,David,Say... say that last part again?
196,17,2,Stan Marsh,What?
197,17,2,David,Well what was the last part you said?
198,17,2,Stan Marsh,I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
199,17,2,David,"Nono, the part about your parents not getting the channels easily?"
200,17,2,Stan Marsh,I... said it would really bum them out.
201,17,2,David,How... [he and the cable guy being to rub their nipples again] How much would it bum them out?
202,17,2,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company."
203,17,2,Your Local Cable Company President,"Hello. In an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere, your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming. Customers still wishing to view true-crime networks will now need to purchase a separate package [pulls back his coat and rips some patches off his dress shirt] which will require a technician to service your cable box every night from 2 to 3 am. and must include the purchase of 300 channels in Portuguese. We realize this may be an inconvenience to you, and we hope you will voice ALL your concerns to us, because at your local cable company the customer is always... our bitch."
204,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!"
205,17,2,Stan Marsh,"Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad."
206,17,2,Randy Marsh,[gets up angrily from his chair] I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off! [Sharon stops washing the dishes and leaves the kitchen. Randy notices and follows her with his eyes] Oh crap.
207,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. [approaches her]"
208,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other."
209,17,2,Randy Marsh,"[puts his arms on her shoulders] No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us."
210,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?"
211,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"I'm here, Randy."

214,17,2,Randy Marsh,Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
215,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"I've got a surprise for you too, Randy."
216,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah? What's that? [Sharon whips out an axe and jams it into Randy's forehead] AAAGH! [Randy falls on his side and dies. In real life...] Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?![Sharon is smiling]"
217,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Sorry. I couldn't resist.
218,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!"
219,17,2,Sharon Marsh,Oh I did! That felt really great.

221,17,2,Sharon Marsh,[getting sensuous] Yeah...
222,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now."
223,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"Okay. [hours later, Stan comes home from school. He comes up the stairs wearing his backpack and hears his parents having a good time in their room. He walks over and goes in without knocking] Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!"
224,17,2,Randy Marsh,That felt so good!
225,17,2,Sharon Marsh,My turn again.
226,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Okay, hang on."
227,17,2,Sharon Marsh,I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
228,17,2,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now."
229,17,2,Sharon Marsh,You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! [CHUNK!]
230,17,2,Randy Marsh,"OH! Ohoho, you bitch! [Stan looks down, then turns around and walks out] Ohohunh."
231,17,2,Sharon Marsh,"Oh I love you, Randy."
