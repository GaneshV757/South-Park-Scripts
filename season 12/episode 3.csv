0,12,3,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it ""The Choking Game"", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?"
1,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"You can get high from choking yourself? [Kenny feels for his neck through his hood, then squeezes once he finds it]"
2,12,3,Mr Mackey,"Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?"
3,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee."
4,12,3,Eric Cartman,Cat pee? [Kenny lets up and then tries to choke himself again]
5,12,3,Stan Marsh,"That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?"
6,12,3,Mr Mackey,"Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay? [Kenny is trying really hard to choke himself] Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad."
7,12,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine. [Mr. Kitty meows] Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? [Mr. Kitty meows]"
8,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,You guys are wasting your time.
9,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, this is not gonna work."
10,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, ready Kenny?"
11,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(All set.)
12,12,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, bring out...! The other male cat. [Kyle walks to a pet carrier, opens the door, pulls out a brown striped cat, and places it on the coffee table opposite Mr. Kitty. The two cats meow at each other first, then growl at each other. After a short while, Mr. Kitty shoots concentrated piss into Kenny's face]"
13,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Ow.)
14,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! [Kenny staggers backwards. The other guys gather round him]
15,12,3,Stan Marsh,Do you feel anything?
16,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? [Kenny's not responding. His mind is elsewhere...]"
17,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hey cool! Check it out!)
18,12,3,Girl 2's Father,I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.
19,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeahhh!)
20,12,3,Girl 2's Father,Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
21,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Okay.) [follows her towards the fountain. At the fountain's edge, she undresses, then he begins to undress]"
22,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[through Kenny's hallucination] Kenny! Kenny, wake up! [In the middle of town, Cartman is stopping Kenny from disrobing any further] Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!"
23,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(What?) [opens his eyes and looks around] (Where'd she go?) [stands up and pulls up his pants.]
24,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls."
25,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(You fucking asshole!)
26,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?"
27,12,3,Kenny McCormick,[Punching Cartman] (What the fuck did you do that for?)
28,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle come up to restrain Kenny]"
29,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!"
30,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"[walks away from them a bit, mad] (Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)"
31,12,3,Stan Marsh,What titties?
32,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"[turns around] (The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)"
33,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering."
34,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes."
35,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(I almost... touched them.)
36,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore."
37,12,3,Announcer,"Next on FOX News! [SPECIAL REPORT: FOX NEWS] It's the newest drug craze. and it's killing your kids! [""killing your kids"" appears over scenes of kids falling over]"
38,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Killing our kids? [leans forward]
39,12,3,Reporter,"All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine! [two women have their cats face off, and one of them gets concentrated urine on her face. She laughs] Huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state [the affected woman moved her arms up and open, then freezes as her eyes get unfocused] and is also referred to as... cheesing. [Letters cut out into cheese shapes appear: ""CHEESING"". Cut to the front of J. Brown Elementary School, day.] Why ""cheesing""? Because it's ""fon to due"". [the words appear onscreen. Cut to a girl's silhouette] This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months."
40,12,3,Girl 2's Father,"[in a deep, electronically-altered voice] We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long."
41,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
42,12,3,Reporter,"So how can you tell if your child is cheesing? [some graphics begin to appear]

1. Your child seems distant, preoccupied.
2. Your child's face smells like cat urine.
3. When you see tigers at the zoo, your child starts grinding his or her teeth.


You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as ""Hey, let's go cheese."" or ""Do you feel like cheesing, guys?"" or ""Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now."""
43,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,[now standing next to Gerald] Kids are doing this?
44,12,3,Reporter,"Kids do it because it's legal. [a teen boy looks at the camera with a fierce face. A skull and crossbones appear over it] What can you do before it's too late? [a picture of a cat switches with its negative for a strobe effect a few times, then ends with the negative and an echoing meow]"
45,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"We have to protect our children from this, Sheila."
46,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as ""the cheese game"", or ""vitamin cheese"", or ""Mary Jane piss in your face fun time"". Cheesing is spreading fast."
47,12,3,Sharon Marsh,"[stands up] All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?"
48,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
49,12,3,Stephen Stotch,"[stands up] Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!"
50,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!"
51,12,3,Randy Marsh,[stands up again] Let's hear it for Gerald!
52,12,3,Stephen Stotch,[stands up again] Hooray for Gerald! [the rest of the audience begins to cheer and argue]
53,12,3,Craig s sister,No! No!
54,12,3,Agent 1,"Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie. [walks off with the cat] Jeez... [Two other agents leave another house with a cat]"
55,12,3,Girl 2 s Father,"Goodbye, Scrambles. [his daughter cries into his left pant leg] We'll miss you. [nearby, the cats are tossed into the DEA vans and taken away]"
56,12,3,Agent 2,Got two here.
57,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hey! What the hell are you doing?!)
58,12,3,Agent 1,"Sorry, these are illegal."
59,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(What?! No! What are you doing?!) [the agents toss the cats into the van] (You fuckers!) [the van drives off.]
60,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off. [the agents soon leave, and Cartman walks up to the dim attic with a small book] Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now. [drops the book in front of the cat] Here. Write a diary."
61,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, have you seen Kenny?"
62,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today."
63,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys... [Cartman and Stan turn to listen] I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing."
64,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is."
65,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed."
66,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, who has cats these days? [laughs nervously]"
67,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now."
68,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)
69,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny? [pounds three more times]
70,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Kenny, you home? [Kenny yells some more. Alarmed, the boys open the door and enter the house. They see that Kenny was indeed cheesing. Two cats look back at them.]"
71,12,3,Kenny McCormick,[really high] (Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) [one cat runs out]
72,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny!
73,12,3,Kenny McCormick,[still cheering and making flying motions] (Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)
74,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! [Kenny flutters some more, stops, and passes out, falling to the floor]"
75,12,3,Stan Marsh,Kenny!
76,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny!
77,12,3,Butters Stotch,"There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken."
78,12,3,Kenny McCormick,[groans]
79,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, we need to have a serious talk."
80,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"(No we don't, guys.)"
81,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life."
82,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)"
83,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! [abruptly, Kenny vomits, stops, then vomits again. Some of it gets on Butters' face and shirt.]"
84,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out."
85,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you."
86,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"[exhausted] (Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)"
87,12,3,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?"
88,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[grabs the other cat as it walks up to him] We've gotta keep this away from him.
89,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[sits up] Mr. Kitty, shhh! [Mr. Kitty meows a 3rd time] Damn it! [gets up and leaves the bed. A small door to the attic opens and Cartman pops in with a candle. Mr. Kitty is nearby] Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you. [Mr. Kitty goes to a window and meows. Cartman follows him to the window] What?! [looks out a half-moon window and sees a cat, it meows] It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet. [Mr. Kitty meows] No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself. [Mr. Kitty meows] I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty. [crosses his arms] I'm in trouble enough as it is. [Mr. Kitty paws at Cartman] All right, all right, fine. [heads to the attic door and goes downstairs, closing the door behind him]"
90,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[whispers and motions] All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly. [two kittens walk up next to Rufus] Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all. [they all look at him sadly, one of them meows] I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to- [the cats lower their head further while focusing on Cartman, Cartman starts to have tears in his eyes] Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. [turns and leaves]"
91,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,Huh? [removes the clothes hiding the cat] Oh my God... [moments later she's downstairs standing next to Gerald.]
92,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?"
93,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up to them] Yeah?
94,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, have you been getting high?!"
95,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[shrugs] No.
96,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Then why did your mother find this [holds up a bag of contraband - the cat] in your dresser drawer?!
97,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[holds his hands out in denial] All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend."
98,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,"[pointing] Don't lie to us, Kyle!"
99,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,How long have you been on the cheese?!
100,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
101,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
102,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?"
103,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, Kyle!"
104,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,God! [goes upstairs]
105,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,"Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!"
106,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
107,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,What are you gonna do?
108,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. [heads off]"
109,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"[showing a weakness of some sort] No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this. [continues down the steps] I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat. [getting dramatic] But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting. [approaches a contraption similar to the one Cartman made, but this one has a movie projector and screen. He takes the cat out of the bag and straps it into the contraption] I... I'll just do it one more time. [ties the cat's tail to the roof of the contraption's frame so there's no obstruction] One. Last. Time. [unfurls the screen] Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat. [moves a large empty box aside] And then I'll never do it again. [kneels down at the table and grabs the projector's trigger] After this one... last... time... [click. The projector begins to roll and a cat appears onscreen. The cat in the harness gets excited and begins to snarl. It finally squirts and Gerald stumbles backward a bit. He walks backward and freezes, his eyes unfocused]"
110,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
111,12,3,Eric Cartman,Who is it?!
112,12,3,Large-breasted Woman,"[with a foreign accent] Please! Open the door. [he opens the door, and a middle-aged woman stands before him] They say you are hiding cats."
113,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[quickly looks both ways] Hiding cats? [nervously] Why, that would be illegal. [backs into the living room]"
114,12,3,Large-breasted Woman,"[enters] You don't understand [kneels] My little Nishka, [produces the cat] She has nowhere else to go."
115,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another."
116,12,3,Large-breasted Woman,But they will find her.
117,12,3,Eric Cartman,"I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can- [his weakness comes through as the cat gazes at him] Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more..."
118,12,3,Large-breasted Woman,"[hands him Nishka, Cartman takes Nishka and pets her] Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. [begins to sob. Cartman joins her]"
119,12,3,Eric Cartman,"What the hell? [Kenny has somehow found the cats and is squeezing them to get cheesed. His face and parka are covered with concentrated piss. He grabs another cat and cheeses some more] Kenny, get out of here!"
120,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Woooooh! Woooooh!) [Kenny dances out of the attic]
121,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Aw, crap- Kenny! [Cartman begins to follow him down, but stops temporarily] Bad. Kitties."
122,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dad! Somebody's at the front door! [the doorbell rings twice and Kyle goes to his room door] Well am I grounded or not?! [the doorbell rings three times] Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! [leaves his room and opens the front door]
123,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up."
124,12,3,Eric Cartman,"He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude."
125,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[quizzically] What?
126,12,3,Stan Marsh,He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
127,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!"
128,12,3,Eric Cartman,"They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! [crosses his arms and looks away. Stan opens his mouth in shock, Kyle looks angrily at Cartman]"
129,12,3,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself."
130,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?"
131,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Hey everybody. Good to see you again. [Gerald and the woman head for the fountain. They both start undressing.]
132,12,3,Girl 2's Father,Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!
133,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,Huh... how come?
134,12,3,Girl 2's Father,There is... another suitor. [Kenny walks into view]
135,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"What? [sees who it is] Get out of here, kid!"
136,12,3,Kenny McCormick,"(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)"
137,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,You're too young for this stuff!
138,12,3,Girl 2's Father,"This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis! [the woman hides her privates, her father's arm blocks a full view of her breasts]"
139,12,3,Girl 2's Father,Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy! [the camera pans down and left to reveal a golden trophy made of two female statuettes kneeling back to back and holding their arms out. The woman places her breasts on their hands so it looks like the actual trophy is her breasts.]
140,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
141,12,3,Jimbo Kern,They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
142,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"She's mine, you little asshole!"
143,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Get the fuck off of me!)
144,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,[arriving] Gerald?!
145,12,3,Reporter,The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.
146,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
147,12,3,Sheila Broflovski,Don't touch me.
148,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"And to the people of South Park. [a shot of the town square and its citizens] I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine. [Kenny looks down in shame] We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain."
149,12,3,Stan Marsh,[puzzled] What the hell is he talking about?
150,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[eyes closed] I have no idea.
151,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real."
152,12,3,Randy Marsh,And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. [Sharon glares at him.]
153,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. [Kenny looks down again]"
154,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. I guess so.)
155,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-"
156,12,3,Stephen Stotch,"[cupping Butters' ears so Butters can't hear anything] Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald."
157,12,3,Gerald Broflovski,"The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats! [grins wide, then begins to cheer] Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! [crowd remains silent]"
158,12,3,Girl 2 s Father,"Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya? [Scrambles hisses, then scratches the father all over his head. His frightened wife and daughter leave him alone] Ahh! Get him off! [the boys, standing across the street, turn around]"
159,12,3,Stan Marsh,I'm sure glad that's over with. [the boys turn left and walk away]
160,12,3,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
161,12,3,Eric Cartman,"But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. [Kyle stops]"
162,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,[cross] And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
163,12,3,Eric Cartman,"[strokes his chin] Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle."
164,12,3,Stan Marsh,You guys! Check it out. [smiles] It's Kenny. [Kenny has crossed the street to reach a flower patch. He picks one out and inhales deeply] Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
165,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [Kenny begins to grab more flowers with gusto to get more of their aroma. The other boys get worried] He's getting... really high on life. [Kenny begins to snort and grabs all the flowers he can, treating them just as he did the cats earlier.]"
166,12,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life."
167,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[runs to Kenny] Kenny! [Stan and Cartman follow. Kenny falls in Kyle's arms, goes into spasms, and then freezes, his eyes unfocused]"
168,12,3,Stan Marsh,What the hell kind of flowers are those?
169,12,3,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny? Kenny?!
