0,12,2,Announcer,"Live, from Chicago, Illinois, it's Decision 2008."
1,12,2,Moderator,[in a droning voice] Good evening and welcome to the political debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. [turns to them] First question: How do you see yourself as different from your opponent?
2,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?"
3,12,2,Randy Marsh,"This is important, Stanley! [the boys look at him] You boys should care about this stuff."
4,12,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but we totally don't."
5,12,2,Randy Marsh,Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
6,12,2,Moderator,"And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending?"
7,12,2,Barack Obama,"Well, my opinion is that-"
8,12,2,Announcer,"We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch! [a montage of Britney pictures is stamped with a stamp saying ""Britney Watch"" inside it. Dramatic background music starts up] Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!"
9,12,2,Butters Stotch,[wakes up and looks at the screen] Man...
10,12,2,Randy Marsh,"[getting excited, leans forward] Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?"
11,12,2,Anchorman,"Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more."
12,12,2,Robert Pooner,"Ron, I'm standing in South Mark, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. [the boys react to the news]"
13,12,2,Eric Cartman,"Aw dude, that's our town!"
14,12,2,Robert Pooner,"Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground [shots of her pitching a tent and relaxing in a chair after the tent is up], and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend. [a shot of her squatting and pissing on the ladybug. The blurred area is her face]"
15,12,2,Randy Marsh,She's such a train wreck!
16,12,2,Robert Pooner,"When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused. [extreme closeup of the piss hitting the ladybug]"
17,12,2,Ron,"[the anchorman] This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight."
18,12,2,Robert Pooner,"That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits! [a closeup of her chin shows two zits]"
19,12,2,Butters Stotch,"Aw, poor girl."
20,12,2,Randy Marsh,"[rising from his armchair] Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. [heads towards the kitchen]"
21,12,2,Ron,"The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado [a photo of Brian Willis holding lots of bricks of money appears], who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars."
22,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,A hundred thousand dollars?
23,12,2,Eric Cartman,That's enough to buy slaves!
24,12,2,Ron,Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.
25,12,2,Hillary Clinton,...and spearchuckers.
26,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,[gets off the sofa] Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
27,12,2,Stan Marsh,[gets off the sofa] And she's at a hotel in our town. [Cartman gets up as well and gets restless]
28,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera."
29,12,2,Eric Cartman,[runs off] Sweet!
30,12,2,Butters Stotch,"[finally gets up] Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone."
31,12,2,Stan Marsh,"[thinks a bit, then] Butters, don't be such a pussy."
32,12,2,Butters Stotch,"[looks at Stan, then at Kyle] Hokay. [smiles]"
33,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
34,12,2,Butters Stotch,"[hidden, comes to the front] Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! [something stops them in their tracks]"
35,12,2,Stan Marsh,Oh no.
36,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!"
37,12,2,Photographer 1,Join the club.
38,12,2,Photographer 2,"Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!"
39,12,2,Eric Cartman,"We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! [the boys make it through the crowd and approach a set of stairs. A security guard stops them]"
40,12,2,Guard,"Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs."
41,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[stammers] We uh, we have special permission?"
42,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids."
43,12,2,Guard,You are?
44,12,2,Butters Stotch,[not amused] Not me! I'm a squirrel!
45,12,2,Britney Spears,But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo- [several knocks are heard at her door]
46,12,2,Guard,"Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel."
47,12,2,Britney Spears,My boys? Really? Send them in. [to the caller] It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now. [hangs up. Stan and the others enter the room]
48,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,We did it guys!
49,12,2,Stan Marsh,I told you that would work!
50,12,2,The Boys,"Yehehahah, all right!"
51,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Ahall right!
52,12,2,Britney Spears,"[walks up to them] You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?"
53,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"All right. Butters, go get next to her."
54,12,2,Butters Stotch,I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
55,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?"
56,12,2,Britney Spears,"[walks back to the table] You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?"
57,12,2,Butters Stotch,It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! [Britney opens a drawer and pulls something out]
58,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!"
59,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else."
60,12,2,Eric Cartman,"[aims his camera] All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'."
61,12,2,Britney Spears,I've got a better idea.
62,12,2,Stan Marsh,You do?
63,12,2,Britney Spears,"Yeah. [whips out a big shotgun, shoves the nozzle into her mouth, and pulls the trigger]"
64,12,2,Stan Marsh,"NO! [the gun goes off and she falls to the ground. The gun falls away from her. All four boys stand there, stunned and speechless. Cartman does not take any pictures. After a bit, Cartman turns and runs out. Butters looks at Stan and Kyle, then heads for the door]"
65,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"NO! [the gun goes off and she falls to the ground. The gun falls away from her. All four boys stand there, stunned and speechless. Cartman does not take any pictures. After a bit, Cartman turns and runs out. Butters looks at Stan and Kyle, then heads for the door]"
66,12,2,Butters Stotch,[stops and looks back] You killed her! [leaves]
67,12,2,Guard,"Hey, everything all right u-. Oh."
68,12,2,Nurse,"[over the PA system] Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? [another nurse wheels an elderly patient across the hall]"
69,12,2,Stan Marsh,We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
70,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
71,12,2,Doctor,[walks up to Stan and Kyle and faces them] She's... alive.
72,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Whew.
73,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, thank God."
74,12,2,Doctor,"But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?"
75,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?"
76,12,2,Doctor,I don't want you making her upset.
77,12,2,Stan Marsh,"We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry."
78,12,2,Doctor,[sighs] All right.
79,12,2,Doctor,"[enters with Stan and Kyle] Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something. [Britney gargles something. Only her lower jaw and the base of her skull remain of her head]"
80,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God!
81,12,2,Stan Marsh,Oh no!
82,12,2,Doctor,"[by Britney's side] The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney. [glares at Stan and Kyle] Right, boys?!"
83,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. [Britney gargles something back. The boys join the doctor at her side]"
84,12,2,Doctor,"Well, I'll let you boys have your say. [walks off. Britney gargles something]"
85,12,2,Stan Marsh,"[his voice shaking] Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself."
86,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, God, what have we done?!"
87,12,2,Announcer,It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
88,12,2,ET Reporter,"[outside Denver Medical Center, with photographers swarming the area] You won't believe what Britney's done now. The troubled pop star has just been spotted with a crazy ""no top part of my head"" look. This video [shown as he speaks] was taken just hours ago as Britney was wheeled into the hospital for some reason. And if we zoom in on the footage, right, ri-right here [the camera zooms in on the left breast], you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past."
89,12,2,Anchorman,"O ho ho, oh houch, that's gotta be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical ""no top of the head"" look?"
90,12,2,Chris,"No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out."
91,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[he and Stan are blinded by the flash] Dude! [the doctor reaches the curtains and closes them, but the flashes don't stop going off]"
92,12,2,Doctor,"Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!"
93,12,2,Manager,"Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager. [sees her in bed] Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this."
94,12,2,Britney Spears,Guglo.
95,12,2,Manager,"Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that."
96,12,2,Paparazzo,"Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly. [Britney instinctively raises her left arm to shield her eyes from the camera, though she has no eyes now]"
97,12,2,Doctor,Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.
98,12,2,Britney Spears,"Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her?"
99,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, of course. [begins to help out]"
100,12,2,Manager,"[softly] Okay, come on! [leads the boys and Britney out] My car is right here. [opens the door and gets in. The photographers are within earshot...]"
101,12,2,Photographer 3,Hey look!
102,12,2,Photographer 4,There she is! [A photographer points and his face becomes distorted. The photographers rush the car before the manager can leave]
103,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh crap! [the photographers again clamor for Britney's attention, and one of them asks about her choice of shoes]"
104,12,2,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
105,12,2,Manager,"Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time. [to the photographers] Thank you! Yes, thanks. [drives out of the crowd and peels away. The paparazzi look on and then pursue the car on foot]"
106,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can."
107,12,2,Manager,"That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away."
108,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
109,12,2,Manager,"All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it."
110,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?"
111,12,2,Sound Engineer,"All right, Brit, let's try it from the top. [a studio hand gives her some headphones to work with, and she holds them up against what would be her right ear. She gargles intermittently]"
112,12,2,Female Aide,"God, what a train wreck."
113,12,2,Male Aide,She must be stoned again. [Britney continues to gargle more often and longer]
114,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse."
115,12,2,Manager,"Whattaya mean? She sounds great. [suddenly stops the music] Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be ""love elation"". Sounds more like you're saying ""love creation""."
116,12,2,Britney Spears,Gogehah.
117,12,2,Manager,E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.
118,12,2,Britney Spears,Egeul-gageol
119,12,2,Sound Engineer,"Gah, she's so stupid."
120,12,2,Stan Marsh,What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
121,12,2,Sound Engineer,"I know. She's really dumb, huh? [smiles]"
122,12,2,Stan Marsh,"No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!"
123,12,2,Sound Engineer,"[cups his hands like he's grabbing Britney] Yeah. And she's all fat, too."
124,12,2,Britney Spears,Okel?
125,12,2,Announcer,"Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards"
126,12,2,VJ,"What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears! [two stage hands walk Britney out on stage]"
127,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw come on now, people! [the manager is pleased with the performance]"
128,12,2,Woman,"Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. [the song begins: ""It's Britney, bitch!"" Britney is waiting for her cue as dancers swirl around her. She begins to warble, and it echoes. She walks and immediately a dancer keeps her from falling.]"
129,12,2,Singers,"The way she fee-els. [Britney leans over, and another dancer stands her up again. She warbles some more] Love inside."
130,12,2,Elderly Man,"Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing."
131,12,2,Stan Marsh,[annoyed] She doesn't have any lips!
132,12,2,Singers,Temporary. [Britney warbles some more. Two male dancers come by and turn her around so the camera can focus on her ass] So hot! [a few moments she gets a solo segment and four male dancers fawn over her]
133,12,2,ET Reporter,"Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues."
134,12,2,Manager,"Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow. [walks over to the door and opens it. The paparazzi is there, piled on from floor to ceiling] Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. [leaves, closing the door. No paparazzi get in. Once the place is silent, she sits back on her armchair and relaxes with a sigh. Stan and Kyle can only look on]"
135,12,2,Stan Marsh,"We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace."
136,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?"
137,12,2,Stan Marsh,[strokes his chin and takes a few steps forward] I know where.
138,12,2,Stan Marsh,We want three tickets to the North Pole. [the clerk stops what he's doing and looks around]
139,12,2,Clerk,The North Pole? [leaves his chair and walks to the window] Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
140,12,2,Stan Marsh,"We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. [Kyle and Britney stand behind him. Britney is wearing a wig, sunglasses, and hat as a disguise]"
141,12,2,Announcer,[breathless] It's Britney Wowtch!
142,12,2,Ron,A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise! [a shot of Stan and Kyle leading Britney down the street]
143,12,2,Robert Pooner,"Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe. [the camera zooms in on her crotch to show what looks like a camel's toe under her shorts]"
144,12,2,Ron,"Oooooh, ouch!"
145,12,2,Anchorwoman,"Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense."
146,12,2,Leslie,"Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with that kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads."
147,12,2,Ron,"[grunts a little] Eh, David, any idea as to how big the camel toe actually was? [a shot of Britney and a camel toe together]"
148,12,2,Robert Pooner,"She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet."
149,12,2,Ron,Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.
150,12,2,Tracy,[a picture of Butters being dragged towards an animal control truck] The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation.
151,12,2,Ron,"Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts."
152,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station."
153,12,2,Paparazzo,[behind the boys] There she is! It's Britney! [more photographers show up and begin to take pictures]
154,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh no. [he and Kyle quickly whisk Britney away, the photographers hot on their tails. They pass a room whose door is slightly open. Seconds later they return to it, go in, and shut the door]"
155,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, they're never gonna let us through."
156,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yes they are! I have an idea.
157,12,2,Paparazzo 2,Britney? Where'd she go?
158,12,2,Paparazzo 3,"There she is! [Kyle appears wearing Britney's disguise. He turns to look at the paparazzi, then runs away. The paparazzi start taking pictures and following him. He runs down the street, the paparazzi pursue him]"
159,12,2,Stan Marsh,"It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. [Britney gargles something]"
160,12,2,Manager,"There she is. Hey Britney, it's me. [Kyle ignores him and keeps running. He joins the paparazzi in chasing ""Britney"" down. Kyle runs through a park; they're right behnd him. Kyle runs into a garden full of statues, stops, and turns around] Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?"
161,12,2,ET Reporter,"Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!"
162,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[takes off the sunglasses] I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!"
163,12,2,Paparazzo 5,"Ooo, psych!"
164,12,2,Manager,She must be back at the train station; come on! [they turn around and go back]
165,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute! [the group turns around. Kyle drops the sunglasses] Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?"
166,12,2,Paparazzo 6,"[steps forward] Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die."
167,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,[quizzically] Huh? [thunder starts rolling in the distance]
168,12,2,Paparazzo 7,What do you think all this effort has been for?
169,12,2,Manager,[a sinister smile crosses his face] It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.
170,12,2,Officer,She must... die.
171,12,2,Background Singers,Hetus. Alte omnebus. [the photographers begins to join in] Virtu e poquebus. [other adults join in this nonsensical Latin chant]
172,12,2,Narrator,"Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole."
173,12,2,Stan Marsh,"You doing okay, Ms. Spears? [she gargles. From the train's cab, the conductor looks back at Britney and Stan through the cab door's window]"
174,12,2,Conductor,"[on the phone] It's her. Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears; [looks at a photo] it looks just like the picture. [the photo he holds is that of a camel's toe, not of Britney] You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand. [begins chanting] Rectus. Hoc honebus"
175,12,2,Elderly Man,"Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town."
176,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
177,12,2,Bob Summers,"Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?"
178,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,NO!
179,12,2,Paparazzo 8,"Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice."
180,12,2,Bob Summers,"In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die."
181,12,2,Paparazzo 9,"We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times."
182,12,2,Paparazzo 1,Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.
183,12,2,Canadian Paparazzo,It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death.
184,12,2,Woman,Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
185,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
186,12,2,Elderly Man,"Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest."
187,12,2,Paparazzo 11,"All right, everyone's about here."
188,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,[bewildered] Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
189,12,2,Male passenger,"Hey, where are we? This isn't right. [Stan looks out the window quickly. Outside is an empty field, but a horde of photographers race through it and reach the train, clamoring for her attention and ready to take pictures]"
190,12,2,Stan Marsh,Oh no!
191,12,2,Britney Spears,Ohhh thoooo!
192,12,2,Stan Marsh,"[hops down and grabs Britney's hand] Come on, Britney! [pulls her out the opposite side and into the field] Come on, come on! [as they run, Kyle's hat falls away. They reach the end of the field and enter a clearing. They look around and find themselves surrounded. All sorts of people are there, not just paparazzi. The escape route they just used is closed off by more spectators. Stan looks around and some faces are recognizable, like Irene. Sheila and Gerald show up]"
193,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad! [runs up to them] They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?"
194,12,2,Gerald Broflovski,"It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy."
195,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Be a good boy? You know all about this?
196,12,2,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?"
197,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,"She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!"
198,12,2,Stan Marsh,Sacrificed? For what?
199,12,2,Randy Marsh,"For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it."
200,12,2,Canadian Paparazzo,"Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch."
201,12,2,Kyle Broflovski,Corn harvest!
202,12,2,Randy Marsh,"We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest."
203,12,2,Stan Marsh,"All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!"
204,12,2,Manager,The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
205,12,2,Paparazzo 12,Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.
206,12,2,Farmer,And harvest is coming soon.
207,12,2,Bob Summers,"All right, folks, let's finish this quickly. [everyone whips out a camera and starts taking pictures, closing in on Britney all the while]"
208,12,2,Stan Marsh,"No wait. [Britney groans. People get close, take pictures, then make way for more people]"
209,12,2,Woman 2,"Come on, hurry up."
