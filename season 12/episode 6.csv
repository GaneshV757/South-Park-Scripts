0,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed."
1,12,6,Stan Marsh,"Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things"
2,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!"
3,12,6,Stan Marsh,"[sighs] Aw man! [shuts off his monitor as Sharon leaves, then goes to bed. Sharon heads for Shelly's room]"
4,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime."
5,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!"
6,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Shelly! [leaves and closes the door]"
7,12,6,Shelly Marsh,Why do you hate me?!
8,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"[entering Randy's study] Randy, off the Internet."
9,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone."
10,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"No, mister, it's time for night-night."
11,12,6,Randy Marsh,"But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-"
12,12,6,Sharon Marsh,You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. [leaves and closes the door]
13,12,6,Randy Marsh,[left to his thoughts] One more thing? [thinks a bit and then starts typing quickly] Ooooyeah... [starts masturbatng under the desk]
14,12,6,Stan Marsh,What the hell?
15,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[entering, still in his night robe] Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! [reaches Stan's desk with urgency and moves Stan away]"
16,12,6,Stan Marsh,What?
17,12,6,Randy Marsh,"My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?"
18,12,6,Stan Marsh,My Internet's not working either.
19,12,6,Randy Marsh,What?! [sees but doesn't believe]
20,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"[enters Stan's room with her laptop] Dad, the Internet's not working!"
21,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[pulling on some cables] I know that, okay?!"
22,12,6,Shelly Marsh,I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
23,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"[enters] Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open."
24,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[leaves the computer to be in the middle of his family] Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. [he's the only one looking panicked]"
25,12,6,Randy Marsh,[in despair] Gerald. Please help us.
26,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,Randy. What happened?
27,12,6,Randy Marsh,Our house... It has no Internet.
28,12,6,Sheila Broflovski,[arrives and stands next to him] Oh my God.
29,12,6,Randy Marsh,[enters the living room] We've got nothing! It's just gone.
30,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
31,12,6,Randy Marsh,[gratefully] Thank you Gerald. [the other Marshes enter]
32,12,6,Stan Marsh,[heads for a computer] I'm getting on it first.
33,12,6,Randy Marsh,[giving chase] Oh no you're not!
34,12,6,Stan Marsh,"[steps into Kyle's room] Kyle, I need to use your Internet"
35,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,Ih it's not working.
36,12,6,Randy Marsh,[steps into Kyle's room] What?!
37,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
38,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,"No. [rushes to the computer to see for himself] No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night."
39,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[firmly] It's not working, Gerald."
40,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
41,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!"
42,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,I have to get online before school.
43,12,6,Stan Marsh,What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
44,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Right, Starbucks!"
45,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
46,12,6,Stephen Stotch,"Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?"
47,12,6,Randy Marsh,No! Nobody's is!
48,12,6,Man 1,[comes out of his house with a laptop] Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!
49,12,6,Randy Marsh,Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
50,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. [everyone climbs in.]
51,12,6,Randy Marsh,"God, the whole neighborhood's affected. [a man sticks a Yoshiba laptop in front of the windshield]"
52,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Get out of the way, Peterson! [motions him away]"
53,12,6,Motel Clerk,"Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya."
54,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,It's not working here?
55,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store."
56,12,6,Man 2,"No, don't. You're wasting your time."
57,12,6,Randy Marsh,How do you know?!
58,12,6,Man 2,Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!
59,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
60,12,6,Stephen Stotch,Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
61,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Good idea! [walks forward a bit and pulls out a Blackberry] No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!"
62,12,6,Mr Garrison,[with pipe and laptop] There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
63,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
64,12,6,Man 3,What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
65,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[thinks a moment] A television! [everyone else thinks, then moves down the street as if they were one]"
66,12,6,Anchorman,"Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back."
67,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, it's statewide."
68,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,It could be nationwide.
69,12,6,Anchorman,"Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either. [everyone leaves Tele's]"
70,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,No Internet... anywhere...
71,12,6,Randy Marsh,Jesus... we're all alone... [POV change to a shot of the town from a distance. Another POV change to a shot of the town from even further away]
72,12,6,Sharon Marsh,What's the matter?
73,12,6,Randy Marsh,"I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. [coughs]"
74,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead. [looks at Stan] If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! [starts punching Stan around like a punching bag. Stan screams]"
75,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[pulls Shelly away from Stan] Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!"
76,12,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!"
77,12,6,Randy Marsh,You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
78,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Randy, where will you go?"
79,12,6,Randy Marsh,We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
80,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
81,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!"
82,12,6,Stephen Stotch,It could come back.
83,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find. [motions to Sharon] Come on, let's go."
84,12,6,Stephen Stotch,"Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?"
85,12,6,Randy Marsh,How. You won't have Internet. [starts the car and moves out]
86,12,6,Motel Clerk,"[fanning himself] Sorry folks, we're full up."
87,12,6,Randy Marsh,Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
88,12,6,Motel Clerk,You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee. [motions the direction of travel] It's about a mile down the road.
89,12,6,Randy Marsh,"I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. [an elderly man weeps]"
90,12,6,Transient Man 1,"Where are you from, old-timer?"
91,12,6,Transient Men and Old Timer,"Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too."
92,12,6,Transient Man 2,Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.
93,12,6,Transient Man 3,"Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it."
94,12,6,Transient Man 4,When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
95,12,6,Transient Man 1,Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.
96,12,6,Randy Marsh,Sure will be nice. [Stan looks really sad]
97,12,6,Transient Man 5,You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?
98,12,6,Randy Marsh,That's right. We need to get online.
99,12,6,Transient Man 5,"Haha. ""Get online"" he says."
100,12,6,Stan Marsh,[annoyed] What's so funny about that?
101,12,6,Transient Man 5,"Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there? [the other men look at each other] Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead. [his eyes begin to well up] Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder... [weeps]"
102,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. [the group breaks up for the night]"
103,12,6,Shelly Marsh,Amiiir... I miss you so much...
104,12,6,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to her] Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. [she just sits up and punches him away like a beach ball, then lies down without a break in crying]"
105,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Everyone, wake up! [the others wake up] We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! [takes an off-ramp]"
106,12,6,Worker,Name?
107,12,6,Randy Marsh,Do they have Internet here?
108,12,6,Worker,Name?
109,12,6,Randy Marsh,Marsh.
110,12,6,Worker,Service provider?
111,12,6,Randy Marsh,NetZero.
112,12,6,Worker,"All right, stay in line. [moves on to the next car] Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite."
113,12,6,Randy Marsh,So is there Internet here?
114,12,6,Worker 2,"[voice only, from the front] Stay in line and get to your campsite. [Randy drives forward and into the camp]"
115,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet."
116,12,6,Refugee Man 1,"Yeah, they've got it here. [Randy gives a thumbs up]"
117,12,6,Stan Marsh,All right!
118,12,6,Refugee Man 2,"But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a little Internet. [curls his thumb and index finger to create a small space between them] Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully."
119,12,6,Refugee Man 3,Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.
120,12,6,Randy Marsh,Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
121,12,6,Volunteer 1,"Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do."
122,12,6,Refugee Man 4,"Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon."
123,12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, time's up."
124,12,6,Refugee Man 4,No! No wait! I haven't entered the shipping information! [an MP hauls him away] NO! NOO!
125,12,6,Volunteer 2,"Next? Brady, John H."
126,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? [Sharon is within earshot]"
127,12,6,Sharon Marsh,[walks up to him] What did you say?
128,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody."
129,12,6,Anchorman,"And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here. [the fax machine starts printing]"
130,12,6,Anchorman 2,A fax! A fax is coming through! [points to it with both index fingers with lots of enthusiasm]
131,12,6,Anchorman,"Oh yeah, a fax!!"
132,12,6,Anchorman 2,Oh a fax!
133,12,6,Anchorman,"It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!"
134,12,6,Anchorman 2,"It's a fax, we got a fax! [the fax copy pops out and both men grab for it. ] Uh-"
135,12,6,Anchorman,"Oh! it says, ""The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it."""
136,12,6,Anchorman 2,[a few seconds later] We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
137,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,Where... is... the Internet?
138,12,6,General,"Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working."
139,12,6,Scientist 1,"We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly."
140,12,6,General,Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
141,12,6,Scientist 2,"Here it is, general. The Internet. [before them is a colossal router]"
142,12,6,General,What's wrong with it?
143,12,6,Scientist 2,See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green.
144,12,6,General,"[walks towards it a bit, in awe] My God."
145,12,6,Transient Man 6,"Hahaha, thedancingkitty.com, heh, wum, I wonder what that is, hum? [the site appears in the browser] ""Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize!"" hoh, ahaha, ha."
146,12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, time's up."
147,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"No, wait, I I just clicked on the kitty. I got it. [the MP comes up and hauls him off too] No! It wasn't long enough! NOO!"
148,12,6,Volunteer 2,"Next? Nelson, Peter T."
149,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[approaches a volunteer] Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time."
150,12,6,Volunteer 3,"Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get."
151,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[grabs the volunteer's arm, takes him aside and says in a soft voice] I haven't jacked off in over two weeks."
152,12,6,Volunteer 3,So jack off.
153,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[lets go] You don't understand. [the volunteer crosses his arms] I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!"
154,12,6,Volunteer 3,What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!
155,12,6,Randy Marsh,Three minutes would be plenty.
156,12,6,Volunteer 3,Get lost! [walks away]
157,12,6,Randy Marsh,[feeling pain in his genitals] Ohhh.
158,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"[handing out tickets to her children] All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet."
159,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"What number are you, turd?"
160,12,6,Stan Marsh,Eight fifty one.
161,12,6,Shelly Marsh,[switches tickets with him] You're nine twenty three now.
162,12,6,Stan Marsh,Hey! Mom!
163,12,6,Sharon Marsh,"[returns] Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!"
164,12,6,Shelly Marsh,Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! [runs away]
165,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Psst. Hey! Over here! [Randy looks over, then walks to the man] You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?"
166,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, how'd you know?"
167,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy."
168,12,6,Randy Marsh,"I know, right?"
169,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say ""click""."
170,12,6,Randy Marsh,"""Internet Porn Simulator"" [the tent is an ""Internet Porn Simulator. Whatever you want to see.""]"
171,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Give it a try. [lifts up one of the entrance flaps for Randy. Randy enters and sees a makeshift computer on a desk. The monitor is a hollow box. Randy sits down. A hand descends into the hollow box holding a sheet of paper that says ""Anything you want to see with the click of a button!""]"
172,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click. [the hand goes up, some scribbling is heard, and the hand comes down again with a picture of one Japanese stick figure pissing on another's face while the second stick figure lies on her back. This does not arouse him. He rolls away from the desk] Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this! [no one responds] Damn it. [rolls back to the desk and unzips his pants.] Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click. [gets ready to masturbate in anticipation. The picture comes down, and it's three black stick figures with their cocks out surrounding a Japanese stick figure.] Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click. [another picture comes down, this one of a stick-figure woman with a penis. Randy is grinding away down there] Bestiality? Click, click on that. [the next picture is that of a stick-figure man fucking a stick-figure pet in the ass. Randy is close to climax] Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click! [the next picture is that of a Brazilian stick-figure woman farting on a stick-figure man.] Dahya. [the climax fails to arrive] No. No, this isn't gonna work. [pounds his fist on the desk and walks out] It's just not the same."
173,12,6,Refugee Man 5,"Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card."
174,12,6,Randy Marsh,[reaches into his back pocket for his wallet] Well at least that part's like the Internet.
175,12,6,Anchorman,"We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!"
176,12,6,Anchormen and Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again."
177,12,6,General,"[through a megaphone] All right, Internet. What do you want from us? [the collosal router does not reply]  If we've angered you somehow, let us know. [lowers the megaphone] Try to communicate with it digitally again. [a scientist plays a few notes on a music keyboard. There's no reply. The scientist is about to play again when the original notes are sent back, with two others. That didn't go anywhere] I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! [a sniper fires at it, but the bullet had no effect. It just bounced off the router]"
178,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, wait a minute. [gets off the couch and walks away to think alone] Is it possible that..."
179,12,6,Gerald Broflovski,"[stands up] What is it, Kyle?"
180,12,6,Kyle Broflovski,I think... I know what's wrong.
181,12,6,Shelly Marsh,This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
182,12,6,Stan Marsh,It's gotta be our turn soon.
183,12,6,Volunteer 2,"All right, folks, it's bed time. No more Internet for today."
184,12,6,Internet Refugees,AWWW!!! [various protests are heard after this]
185,12,6,Woman,A little closer!
186,12,6,Volunteer 2,"No, no, we're locking it away until tomorrow. [the MPs unplug the computer and carry it and the desk away] Everyone get to bed!"
187,12,6,Internet Refugees,"Aw man! [everyone walks off mumbling, disappointed]"
188,12,6,Woman,Wha?![puts her left hand on her head and walks off with her head tilted back]
189,12,6,Shelly Marsh,"Gggggyyaaah! [punches Stan away, then walks away in the other direction]"
190,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes! [softly as he types] Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. [click. He finds a page right away. The girls are only heard, not shown]"
191,12,6,Girl 1,"Haro Kiti kawaii n desho? [""Hello Kitty is cute, isn't it?"" puke]"
192,12,6,Girl 2,"Un. Choukawaii yo ne! [""Yes. Super cute, right?!"" puke]"
193,12,6,Randy Marsh,Oh niice... Whoa... [begins masturbating]
194,12,6,Girl 1,"Watashi wa... daisuki! [""I"" puke ""love it!""]"
195,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[types away] Now let's see some bestiality. [click. The sound of a woman being rammed by an elephant is heard. Randy is hitting his stride, then heads towards climax] Aahahaha, yes! Ogh! [types away] Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there! [click. The Brazilian fart porn fetish page loads.] Oh that's good eh! Oh! [a view from outside the shed] Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! [other refugees here this and walk out of their tents to see what's going on. Sharon and the kids are out too, but they don't say a thing.]"
196,12,6,Refugee Man 2,What is that?
197,12,6,Refugee Man 4,Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.
198,12,6,Randy Marsh,Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
199,12,6,Volunteer 4,"Get the keys! We gotta get in there. [volunteer 2 runs to the door and whips out his keys. Three other volunteers, one of them a woman, follow him up. They get the door open and enter the shed]"
200,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[voice descending] Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! [the oldest volunteer turns on the lights and they all gasp in shock. Randy is spent, his semen all over the room, the desk, the computer, and himself.]"
201,12,6,Volunteer 2,What the...? [Sharon and the kids rush in]
202,12,6,Stan Marsh,Dad?
203,12,6,Sharon Marsh,Randy!
204,12,6,Randy Marsh,"[trying to explain it away] Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm! [volunteer 4 heads for the computer] Did you see the ghost? [the volunteer begins typing on the keyboard] It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!"
205,12,6,Volunteer 2,You son of a bitch!
206,12,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! [volunteer 4 looks back at Randy, who looks back at him]"
207,12,6,Anchormen and Field Reporter,"This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy [Kyle is shown standing before the router] to attempt his method to get the Internet running again. [shots of this breaking news airing all over the U.S.] It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?"
208,12,6,Scientist 1,All clear for procedure.
209,12,6,General,"All right! Let's do it! [Kyle walks forward, then up the ramp. His parents fear for him. He walks up and to the right, sees the massive plug and walks to the socket. He just pulls the plug out, waits a few seconds, and plugs it back in. The router responds with a full green signal.]"
210,12,6,Scientist 2,Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
211,12,6,Scientist 1,He did it!
212,12,6,Scientist 3,I've got Internet!
213,12,6,Scientist 4,Me too!
214,12,6,Scientist 5,"Internet activity in all sectors, sir. [everyone cheers. Kyle looks around a little puzzled]"
215,12,6,Transient Man 5,I've got Internet.
216,12,6,Transient Man 6,Me too!
217,12,6,Transient Man 3,It's back! [everyone begins to cheer there too]

230,12,6,Randy Marsh,"And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT [pounds the podium hard with his right fist. A few people are startled by this] that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally, [the head of a bald eagle appears on the screen behind him.] We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. [everyone applauds him, then gives him a standing ovation. He has his left arm up and fist pumped.]"
