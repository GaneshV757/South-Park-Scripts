0,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. [the bearded employee steps forward, his hands gripping his suspenders]"
1,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?"
2,12,7,Stan Marsh,Ughh.
3,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,This is gonna suck.
4,12,7,Pioneer Paul,When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome. [tips his hat a bit to the class] To 1864. Set 'em up!
5,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Thank you, Pioneer Paul. [Pioneer Paul turns around and walks away.] All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. [the students look at each other and begin to pair off.]"
6,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Let's be partners, Kenny."
7,12,7,Kenny McCormick,"(No, I'm partners with Craig) [holds Craig's hand]"
8,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay. [turns and follows Stan] Stan, let's be partners, dude. [Stan approaches Wendy and holds out his hand. She takes it]"
9,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Naw, I'm with Wendy."
10,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad! [Wendy flashes him an angry look as he turns and walks away. He looks around and sees most everyone is paired off. He approaches Kyle] All right, let's be partners, Kyle."
11,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I hate you, remember? [turns away] You wanna be partners, Jimmy?"
12,12,7,Eric Cartman,"[miffed] Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token? [Clyde and Token pair up] Who, who else needs a partner? [after the rest of the kids have paired up, only Butters is left. Cartman looks at him and he gets bashful all of a sudden, brushing his left foot back and forth on the ground] Uh who else needs a partner?"
13,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Eric, partner with Butters."
14,12,7,Eric Cartman,God damn it!
15,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Hold Butters' hand, Eric! [Butters motions for Cartman to take his hand]"
16,12,7,Eric Cartman,That isn't necessary!
17,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!"
18,12,7,Butters Stotch,I understand. [takes Cartman's hand as Garrison turns towards the village]
19,12,7,Mr Garrison,"All right, let's head in. [leads the way]"
20,12,7,Eric Cartman,"You can let go now, Butters."
21,12,7,Butters Stotch,[firmly] No.
22,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, come on!"
23,12,7,Butters Stotch,"No! [the class is at the center of the village. Around it are a carriage house, the saloon, and the feed and tackle store]"
24,12,7,Mr Garrison,"All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff. [the pairs disperse] Keep track of your partner!"
25,12,7,Smithy,"Why howdy partners. [puts his tools down] I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through?"
26,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her."
27,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Thanks, Stan."
28,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"[dropping by] These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?"
29,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,[points to the smithy] That guy is wearing a digital watch.
30,12,7,Smithy,Oh jeez. [adjust the watch to hide it. Pioneer Paul gives him an angry look]
31,12,7,Pioneer Paul,Damn it Chad!
32,12,7,Chad,"[puts it in his pocket] S-sorry, I'm sorry."
33,12,7,Gunsmith,"Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns."
34,12,7,Eric Cartman,I wanna shoot an Indian.
35,12,7,Gunsmith,"Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store. [Kenny, Craig, and the two girls leave. Cartman and Butters head for the holes in the wall]"
36,12,7,Butters Stotch,Do you see any Indians?
37,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs. [just over the greenery is Super Phun Thyme, a small attraction next door.] ""Super... Phun Thyme."" [turns to Butters and has him step forward] Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!"
38,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh, that's cool. [steps back and turns around] Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone."
39,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!"
40,12,7,Butters Stotch,Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
41,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Fine, then let go of my hand!"
42,12,7,Butters Stotch,Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
43,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!"
44,12,7,Butters Stotch,I'm not lettin' go!
45,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Fine, then you're comin' with me!"
46,12,7,Butters Stotch,"No, Eric! [trips and stands up. Cartman pulls him towards the village's entrance]"
47,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, let go God-damn it!"
48,12,7,Butters Stotch,No! [trips and tries to stand up] T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!
49,12,7,Pioneer Paul,This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.
50,12,7,Clerk,Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
51,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then."
52,12,7,Clerk,"What do you mean ""back then""? Don't forget, it's 1864."
53,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,Right. Except for it really isn't.
54,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye. [they look around, but the modern sound of sirens reaches their ears]"
55,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
56,12,7,Stan Marsh,Sounds like police sirens.
57,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864. [the sound of screeching tires is next, and everyone heads to the windows to find out. A big SUV pulls into the village and seven people pour out of it. One of them is injured]"
58,12,7,Leader,"We lost them, we lost them!"
59,12,7,Injured Man,Damn pig cops!
60,12,7,Leader,Close that gate! [two of his henchmen close the gate]
61,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,What's going on?
62,12,7,Stan Marsh,I don't know. [the gunmen gather up the students and adults]
63,12,7,Leader,Everyone down on the ground NOW!
64,12,7,Sheriff McLawdog,"Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif- [the leader shoots him in the forehead with a silenced gun]"
65,12,7,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ! [the six of them move away from the window and drop to their knees] We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
66,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing."
67,12,7,Stan Marsh,What?!
68,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, this is serious!"
69,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?"
70,12,7,Clerk,"Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time."
71,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!"
72,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West."
73,12,7,Stan Marsh,[in no mood to hear about it] This is not the time for that!
74,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, this is gonna be awesome! [the go through the double doors] Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!"
75,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Well, that's your problem!"
76,12,7,Eric Cartman,"All right Butters, I've seriously had enough! [tries to rip his hand out of Butters' grip, but only succeeds in pulling Butters around. He tries again, but Butters isn't letting go. He tries a third time, all the way around, and Butters' hand is clamped on tight.] Jesus Christ! [drops the matter and goes to a counter with Butters] One please."
77,12,7,Butters Stotch,Make that two! [they each give $6.]
78,12,7,Super Phun Thyme Cashier,"Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?"
79,12,7,Butters Stotch,NO! [she gives them their tickets and they go into the attraction]
80,12,7,Eric Cartman,NO! [she gives them their tickets and they go into the attraction]
81,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?"
82,12,7,Butters Stotch,"We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!"
83,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! [yanks Butters along.]"
84,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,Over here. This looks like an office.
85,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[opens the door and leads the others in, then spots the phone] Here! Here's the phone! [Wendy gets on the stool and tries to dial out]"
86,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Well, what a straaange contraption."
87,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"I can't get a dial tone. [Kyle listens, then lowers the receiver]"
88,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,What's the number to dial out?
89,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'."
90,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! [Kyle and Wendy trade places]"
91,12,7,Clerk,"Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-"
92,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"[grabs him by the collar and shoves him against the door] Brresh! [points something out to him. It's a sign over the door: ""Remember: Never Break Character!""]"
93,12,7,Clerk,"Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time."
94,12,7,Pioneer Paul,I'll say.
95,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I got through. Hello, police?"
96,12,7,Operator,"Nine one one, what's your emergency?"
97,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
98,12,7,Operator,Taken hostage where?
99,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
100,12,7,Operator,You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
101,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[glances back at the two men] Sister, you don't know the half of it."
102,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!"
103,12,7,Eric Cartman,I'm having a super fun time playin'
104,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here! [next they're playing air hockey. They take turns, but still have to run together in switching sides. They run to Butters' side and Butters hits the puck] Oh, you got it. Nice. [they run to Cartman's side, and Cartman hits the puck. They run back to Butters' side...]"
105,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Super fun time, please don't go awahay."
106,12,7,Butters Stotch,What are you whoofelin' at? [the couple hurries away]
107,12,7,Eric Cartman,"No more worries or cares, super fun time."
108,12,7,Eric Cartman,"[on a Road Hogg motorcycle ride as Butters gets on] Waiwait, keep- you're fine. [starts the ride. The motorcycle rocks back and forth quickly] Oh man, whoa!"
109,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Whoa! [gets tossed into the air, but doesn't let go of Cartman's hand. He ends up on Cartman's lap before the ride ends]"
110,12,7,Eric Cartman,"The answer to my prayers, super fun time.
Super fun time, you're all I need."
111,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeheah, we're wired up!"
112,12,7,Eric Cartman,"I'll have a super fun time till I freakin; bleed.
I love you mornin' noon and night, super fun time."
113,12,7,Eric Cartman,"[two cars bump into him] Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! [Butters is battered]"
114,12,7,Eric Cartman,"You make my life so right, super fun time."
115,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!"
116,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw, just a few more things."
117,12,7,Butters Stotch,"No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!"
118,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. [they leave Super Phun Thyme]"
119,12,7,Leader,"Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area. [turns to the hostage group] Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination."
120,12,7,Mr Garrison,"Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. [the kids are shocked at him. The sirens are heard again]"
121,12,7,Blond,How did they find us?!
122,12,7,Leader,Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building. [a bunch of police cars show up at the parking lot and their officers quickly get out and get into position]
123,12,7,Police Chief,"All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage."
124,12,7,Lieutenant,"Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!"
125,12,7,Police Chief,Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!
126,12,7,Officer 2,"What did they rob, sir?"
127,12,7,Police Chief,A Burger King.
128,12,7,Leader,"All right, good. Is that all of it? [a big balding man comes in with several Burger King meals in bags]"
129,12,7,Balding Man,No. Don't forget we've got these too.
130,12,7,Leader,"Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan. [pulls out a cell phone and dials some numbers.] I'd like to speak with the chief of police! [listens] Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!"
131,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,Why aren't the cops coming in?
132,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,They must be negotiating.
133,12,7,Pioneer Paul,Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
134,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,[annoyed] Will you shut up!
135,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Wait, you have guns here?"
136,12,7,Pioneer Paul,Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.
137,12,7,Stan Marsh,Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
138,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"All righty. Come on, storehand."
139,12,7,Clerk,Yeppir! [they leave]
140,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village."
141,12,7,Butters Stotch,We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
142,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it."
143,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true."
144,12,7,Eric Cartman,"[stops in his tracks] Uh oh. [sees the police at the Pioneer Village entrance.] Crap, they called the cops on us."
145,12,7,Butters Stotch,What?! They called the cops?!
146,12,7,Eric Cartman,They must have realized we left. Damn.
147,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh my God, the police are looking for us!"
148,12,7,Eric Cartman,[covers Cartman's mouth and takes him behind a mail box] Shhh! Butters!
149,12,7,Butters Stotch,[quickly upset] We're gonna get it now!
150,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!"
151,12,7,Butters Stotch,You just got me busted forever!
152,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Butters, l-listen to me, listen."
153,12,7,Butters Stotch,No! [turns away]
154,12,7,Eric Cartman,All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
155,12,7,Butters Stotch,You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. [punches him softly on the chest with his free hand]
156,12,7,Eric Cartman,"If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right? [Butters calms down and stops sobbing] All right, now let go of my hand."
157,12,7,Butters Stotch,No.
158,12,7,Eric Cartman,Butters?
159,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now."
160,12,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, come on! [they head back towards Super Phun Thyme]"
161,12,7,Leader,"Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich."
162,12,7,Ohrlich,The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.
163,12,7,Leader,Above ground?
164,12,7,Ohrlich,"Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft, [a picture of an abandoned gold mine appears] but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock."
165,12,7,Leader,So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.
166,12,7,Ohrlich,"One more thing, Frans: I want my share of the take now."
167,12,7,Frans,"[finally, a name for the leader] What's the matter, Ohrlich? Lose your sense of trust?"
168,12,7,Ohrlich,I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.
169,12,7,Frans,"Very well. [hands him a wad of bills and a Burger King lunch bag. Ohrlich opens the bag, takes out his burger, and leafs through its contents like a deck of playing cards to make sure nothing is missing]"
170,12,7,Frans,"I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!"
171,12,7,Smithy,"I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village. [the woman strikes his face again with her rifle] OW."
172,12,7,Frans,"[holds up the smithy's employee profile] You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons, [reads from the profile] Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!"
173,12,7,Smithy,"Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the- [the woman strikes his face again with her rifle] OW."
174,12,7,Frans,That's it! [aims his gun at Smithy's left temple. The woman backs away] Tell me the code or you die! [the smithy sobs] One... two...
175,12,7,Smithy,I...
176,12,7,Frans,Yes?
177,12,7,Smithy,I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith. [Frans kills him and his body drops off the chair. The class and the pioneer villagers but Craig are stunned]
178,12,7,Craig Tucker,[observes] These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. [another worker is tied up and put on the chair as the smithy's body is dragged away]
179,12,7,Worker,No. Please. Don't hurt me.
180,12,7,Frans,Give us the code to that door and we can leave!
181,12,7,Worker,"[shuts his eyes hard] I've never heard of sss-something called a door code. [leans over and whispers] Please, can't you ask some other way?"
182,12,7,Frans,"I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now! [gets his gun ready]"
183,12,7,Worker,"All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2 [he's killed, but by someone else. The class and the pioneer villagers gasp when it sees whom the killer is. Pioneer Paul is shown with a rifle in his hand, and the general store clerk is next to him]"
184,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"[tosses his rifle away and walks to the class] What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich."
185,12,7,Frans,God damn it you people are fucking insane!
186,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't believe it.
187,12,7,Frans,"Domino, [looks at the balding man, then at another henchman] Walsky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them! [the two henchmen move out]"
188,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! [they start to move.]"
189,12,7,Jimmy Valmer,Yeah. [all stop] We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. [they finally leave]
190,12,7,Officer 2,"Sector Bravo, no activity."
191,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere."
192,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside. [turns left and points] Look, see that traffic signal down there? [the intersection is shown] If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free."
193,12,7,Butters Stotch,That looks dangerous.
194,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on. [they head to the signal. Butters is lighter, so he goes up first. He pulls Cartman along up the traffic signal, then stands on the arm] Good, that's good. [Cartman stands up too] That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across. [they begin to tip-toe along the traffic signal's arm.] Go easy. Good."
195,12,7,Butters Stotch,Oh gosh in heaven.
196,12,7,Eric Cartman,"It's all right. You've got it, no problem- [his left foot slips, causing them both to lose their balance] OP."
197,12,7,Butters Stotch,Whoa!
198,12,7,Eric Cartman,Save me!
199,12,7,Butters Stotch,"I'm gonna fall! [they both scream as they struggle to stay on the arm, but they both fall off... and end up hanging from the arm like a pair of tennis shoes tied together]"
200,12,7,Eric Cartman,"... Oh dude, laaame."
201,12,7,Frans,"Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?"
202,12,7,Domino,We found somebody. [the two henchmen he sent off earlier return]
203,12,7,Walsky,We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.
204,12,7,Pioneer Paul,[gasps] You let out Murderin' Murphy?
205,12,7,Murderin Murphy,Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!
206,12,7,Frans,[frustrated and pissed off] Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!
207,12,7,Woman,Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
208,12,7,Frans,[approaching the employees] I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!
209,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all."
210,12,7,Frans,I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM! [walks over to the students...]
211,12,7,Mr Garrison,Not me! Not me not me not me not me! [...and grabs Kenny]
212,12,7,Kenny McCormick,"(What? Hey, let go.)"
213,12,7,Frans,[drags Kenny to the employees] Do you want to see a child die?!
214,12,7,Kenny McCormick,(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
215,12,7,Butters Stotch,"I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!"
216,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look! [a big truck is headed their way] This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!"
217,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Huh... [swings over, and they both land on the truck. They then move about looking for a good position to jump from]"
218,12,7,Eric Cartman,Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
219,12,7,Butters Stotch,Let's do it!
220,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Ready? Go! [they leap off the truck and over the wooden wall. The police are not aware of this. They land on a roof and roll of it into a wooden wheelbarrow, which tips over and dumps them onto the ground.]"
221,12,7,Frans,"[Domino and Walsky bring the female employee over to Kenny, who is tied up on the chair] What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!"
222,12,7,Woman,"I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper."
223,12,7,Frans,God damn it!
224,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!"
225,12,7,Stan Marsh,"I can't let them do it. [comes out from under the table] I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. [turns and heads for the door, then exits the building]"
226,12,7,Kyle Broflovski,Stan?
227,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[leans out] Where are you going, Stan?"
228,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. [turns around, grabs some dirt, rubs it on his face, and walks to the hostage area]"
229,12,7,Frans,"All right, that does it! [jabs the tip of the gun up against Kenny's hood. Kenny just looks at him] On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!"
230,12,7,Kenny McCormick,"(God damn it, someone help me!)"
231,12,7,Stan Marsh,"[walks up] Well howdy there, strangers. [everyone looks at him as he approaches] Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich.."
232,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Ohhh, welcome, partner. [the other employees welcome him as well.]"
233,12,7,Frans,Wha-what are you doing?
234,12,7,Stan Marsh,I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
235,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa."
236,12,7,Murderin Murphy,They killed my pahr!
237,12,7,Stan Marsh,"I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe."
238,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Y-y-yeah, I understand that."
239,12,7,Clerk,"Finally, a fella that talks some sense."
240,12,7,Stan Marsh,"If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?"
241,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864."
242,12,7,Clerk,"Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is."
243,12,7,Frans,"Eighteen sixty four. Ohrlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us! [smiles]"
244,12,7,Mr Garrison,"No, you got your door code, let us go!"
245,12,7,Walsky,"Copy that. What's the code, over. [Butters and Cartman step out from behind a building, then quickly step back behind it before they can be seen]"
246,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters. [they step out again and walk towards Walsky, who gets ready to shoot] Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?"
247,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, it sure has."
248,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm."
249,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh..."
250,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome."
251,12,7,Butters Stotch,Been a hoot all right!
252,12,7,Walsky,Get your hands behind your head!
253,12,7,Eric Cartman,What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
254,12,7,Walsky,"Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now! [they put their free hands behind their heads, which surprises him] Let go of each other!"
255,12,7,Butters Stotch,Huh uh.
256,12,7,Walsky,Do what I tell you!
257,12,7,Butters Stotch,Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
258,12,7,Walsky,Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
259,12,7,Eric Cartman,Butters.
260,12,7,Walsky,Now!
261,12,7,Butters Stotch,"No! [remembering how Cartman swung him around at Super Phun Thyme, he swings Cartman around and knocks Walsky down. He and Cartman sprint across the field and manage to avoid the barrage of bullets Wilskey sends their way]"
262,12,7,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Christ! [Walsky fires off a grenade, which hits a house just as Cartman and Butters run past it. The blast blows them off their feet]"
263,12,7,Butters Stotch,AAAAH!
264,12,7,Eric Cartman,AAAAH! [this and the gunfire alert the other robbers]
265,12,7,Frans,Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages! [the gunwoman and Ohrlich leave]
266,12,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?"
267,12,7,Murderin Murphy,Yeah.
268,12,7,Stan Marsh,He done killed yer pahr.
269,12,7,Murderin Murphy,[stands up enraged] What?! Well I'll rip his head off! [runs towards Frans and tackles him]
270,12,7,Officer 2,We've got a chance. Hostages are clear! [officers climb over the wooden wall and pour into the village.]
271,12,7,Frans,"They are coming in! [the shootout between cops and robbers begins. Ohrlich is shot dead and his burger drops to the floor next to him. The gunwoman fires, and the cops fire back. She is shot through a window and dies.]"
272,12,7,Mr Garrison,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
273,12,7,Officer 3,"Whoa, no, no!"
274,12,7,Officer 2,Hostages are secure at the park entrance!
275,12,7,Murderin Murphy,"I got you now, Pioneer Paul!"
276,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy! [they get into a fistfight. Domino shoots at the cops from the second floor of the saloon. The cops fire back and Domino keels over, dead. Frans walks over to Ohrlich's body and takes back his cut]"
277,12,7,Police Chief,"[arrives and aims his gun] Freeze, scumbag! It's all over! [Other officers gather and aim their weapons. Frans drops his satchel and puts his hands behind his head.]"
278,12,7,Woman,Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!
279,12,7,Officer 2,[aims his gun at the men] Stop right now! It's over! [a bell rings out three tones and the fistfight ends]
280,12,7,PA System,"Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day. [Murphy and Paul let go of each other and stand up smiling] Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home."
281,12,7,Pioneer Paul,We made it!
282,12,7,Murderin Murphy,We made it! [the employees hug each other and begin to disperse]
283,12,7,Woman 2,"Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress."
284,12,7,Murderin Murphy,"Whoa, that was great! [the employees begin to drop their makeup and other bits of costume]"
285,12,7,Pioneer Paul,"Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!"
286,12,7,Gunsmith,Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeño poppers!
287,12,7,Murderin Murphy,"Yeah, that'd be great!"
288,12,7,Man 1,All right!
289,12,7,Man 2,"Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers."
290,12,7,Man 3,"Let's go, huh."
291,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork."
292,12,7,Stan Marsh,I know.
293,12,7,Police Chief,Come on you!
294,12,7,Frans,You're hurting my arm!
295,12,7,Police Chief,Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?
296,12,7,Frans,"In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all."
297,12,7,Police Chief,That's true. [Frans is put in a squad car and the cops continue with their work]
298,12,7,Wendy Testaburger,"[looks at Pioneer Village] Hey look. [Butters walks towards the entrance dragging Cartman behind him. Cartman is passed out. Butters drags him over the sidewalk, across the parking lot, and on to the bus. Only then does he let go]"
299,12,7,Butters Stotch,"Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! [all energy leaves him and he passes out too]"
