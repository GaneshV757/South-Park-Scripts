0,12,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats. [the kids take their seats as Mr. Garrison approaches his desk and puts the books away] Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? [Clyde, Kyle, and Bradley take their seats and Wendy walks up to the front of the class. She turns to face the class and looks over at Mr. Garrison]"
1,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"[clears her throat] Thank you Mr. Garrison. [reads from her notes] Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer. [Cartman tries to contain his laughter, but it comes out anyway. Wendy is mad, but resumes her report.] An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- [Cartman again tries to contain his laughter]"
2,12,9,Eric Cartman,She said it again. [laughs]
3,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
4,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[enjoying his distraction] Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?"
5,12,9,Mr Garrison,"[lowers his head and rubs his right temple] Eric, for the love of Jesus..."
6,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!"
7,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Me? You're the one talking about killer titties. [Clyde contains a giggle] Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people. [holds his hands out as if grabbing at people] Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!"
8,12,9,Butters Stotch,I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
9,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
10,12,9,Mr Garrison,"[flatly] Eric, stop being offensive."
11,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison."
12,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[irritated] No you aren't!
13,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone. [the other boys laugh. He joins them] Dude, I'm on fire today!"
14,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose. [points to the ceiling] Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof. [Wendy turns and glares at him. Cartman talks into an imaginary walkie talkie] ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" [Wendy suddenly gets in Cartman's face]"
15,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
16,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Not at all. [cups his hands again as if they're killer titties] ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"""
17,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[points to him] You'd better shut up [lowers her right arm] or I'll make you shut up!
18,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?"
19,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
20,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?"
21,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!"
22,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[begins to act like a gangbanger] You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down."
23,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You think you're tough?
24,12,9,Eric Cartman,[takes what looks like a gang pose] Whassup? [takes another one] Whassup?
25,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I'll smack the shit out of you!
26,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Standing right here, let's go, bitch."
27,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
28,12,9,Eric Cartman,You're gonna fight me after school?
29,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,That's right!
30,12,9,Eric Cartman,"You're a chick, dude."
31,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there."
32,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[poses again] Oh, it's on, bitch!"
33,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You're gonna [jabs at the floor for emphasis] fucking die! [turns and walks away. Cartman strikes a few more poses]
34,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody! [goes forth to spread the news. He walks by Stan, Kyle, and Bebe] Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!"
35,12,9,Stan Marsh,What?
36,12,9,Bebe Stevens,Wow. [goes forth to spread the news among the girls. She walks into the girls' bathroom and announces] Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
37,12,9,Girls from various grades,[separately] Really? Wow.
38,12,9,Ike Broflovski,[faltering a bit] Wendy and Cartman are fighting after school. [the other kindergartners jump for joy]
39,12,9,Kindergartners,Yaaay!
40,12,9,Red,"[opens the door and says] Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. [goes back inside and closes the door]"
41,12,9,Pete,[flips his hair out of his eyes] Did she just call us emos?
42,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school."
43,12,9,Token Black,She is pissed off.
44,12,9,Eric Cartman,"She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it."
45,12,9,Clyde Donovan,"[taps Cartman twice on the right arm] Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down. [Cartman leans to the right a bit to get a better view. Craig, Token, and Jimmy look back at the table behind them. Wendy stares back. There are six other girls at her table: Bebe to her right, Lola and Heidi to her left, Esther opposite Bebe, Anne opposite Lola, and Millie opposite Heidi. There's no one seated opposite Wendy, so she has a clear view. Bebe leans over and whispers something to her. Cartman smiles, but the smile turns into worry] She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything."
46,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. [Cartman looks at Wendy again, and Wendy stares back. She makes a fist with her right hand and punches the open palm of her left hand.]"
47,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
48,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, heh. [grabs his milk carton] If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. [takes a sip of milk through a straw and sets the carton down. Cartman begins to panic, looks around, and looks again at Wendy. Her face becomes the only thing he sees]"
49,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?"
50,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What?!
51,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[almost whispering] Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-"
52,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What?
53,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes her aside and whispers] I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry."
54,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!"
55,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes her aside further and whispers] Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness."
56,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!"
57,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[seeing the unwanted attention] Pfft, apologize?! [begins to strike poses] That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh."
58,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
59,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me."
60,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
61,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[trying to put up a front] Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo. [Wendy goes back to her locker, the other kids go their separate ways. Wendy shuts her locker door and Cartman races up to her again. He whispers] Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight."
62,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Get away from me! [walks away]
63,12,9,Michael,"So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend."
64,12,9,Stan Marsh,I guess so.
65,12,9,Pete,"And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? [flips his hair]"
66,12,9,Michael,"Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends."
67,12,9,Stan Marsh,What am I supposed to do about it? [Craig and Jimmy walk up to him]
68,12,9,Craig Tucker,"Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off."
69,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,I'll bet she is!
70,12,9,Butters Stotch,[walks into view] Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! [performs some punching moves]
71,12,9,Eric Cartman,[peers out from the doorway] Wendy. Wendy psst.
72,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What?!
73,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick. [Wendy goes into the room Cartman was hiding in, which is a storage room. Once inside, she looks around, taking it all in.] Wendy, you're not gonna believe this. [She turns and glares at him] I just found out my mom has breast cancer. [she glares harder] Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs."
74,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You really think that's gonna work on me?!
75,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Wendy, [pulls out a letter-sized envelope] I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-"
76,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You can't bribe your way out of this!
77,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[puts his left hand up to hold her back] Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy."
78,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,No you don't.
79,12,9,Eric Cartman,[thinks for a moment] My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
80,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"You don't get it, asshole! [shoves him back a bit] There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!"
81,12,9,Eric Cartman,Eat my underwear?
82,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,That's right.
83,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[walks a few steps away] Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now."
84,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!"
85,12,9,Eric Cartman,"No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will."
86,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You fucking suck so hard!!
87,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I'll eat my underwear, Wendy. [unzips his pants.] And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us."
88,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What are you doing?! [Cartman takes off his underwear]
89,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm committed to peace, Wendy. [begins to swallow his underwear] I want you to see just how humbled I am... [gags]"
90,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Ew! [looks away]
91,12,9,Eric Cartman,[rather muffled] Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy. [tries one last swallow and succeeds] There. Yeahm.
92,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Oh my God!
93,12,9,Eric Cartman,So... [turns to face her] are we cool?
94,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,No!
95,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I ate my underwear! [advances. Wendy backs up] What the hell do you want from me?! [advances again. Wendy backs up, then runs around Cartman towards the door. He can't turn fast enough to match her] Weh-"
96,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[opens the door] You are so pathetic!
97,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[throws himself at her mercy] Wendy it isn't fair! [she runs out of there quickly] I ate my underwear for you! Nooo! [Craig walks by and stops to look in] Yo, what's up dawg?"
98,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk."
99,12,9,Stan Marsh,What?
100,12,9,Eric Cartman,"You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours."
101,12,9,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
102,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch."
103,12,9,Stan Marsh,"I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. [moves towards the stalls, but Cartman runs up ahead of him and stops him]"
104,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken."
105,12,9,Stan Marsh,Really?
106,12,9,Eric Cartman,"You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way- [his gag reflex kicks in and his underwear come back up his throat and out his mouth. Stan looks on a bit stunned as Cartman pulls his underwear the rest of the way out, then glances back and forth at his underwear and at Stan] Oh, that's where I put those. [puts his underwear into a back pocket] Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you."
107,12,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, there's nothing I can do about it."
108,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[runs to Stan's left, by the sinks] God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! [his underwear is hanging from his right hand. Cartman notices, then runs out of the bathroom. Stan looks down helplessly]"
109,12,9,Mr Garrison,"And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle. [Cartman glances at the clock on the wall: 2:58 p.m. His fingers drum the desk softly as he looks ahead blankly remembering Wendy's words: ""I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone!"" Then Butters': ""If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot.""] All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... [Cartman begins to block everything out except Wendy and the wall clock: 2:58 p.m. Wendy's ready to fight.]"
110,12,9,Bebe Stevens,"Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!"
111,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,"As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. [As the wall clock draws towards 3 p.m. Cartman thinks ""There's no way out. She's gonna kick my ass in front of everyone.""]"
112,12,9,Butters Stotch,Almost time. [smiles]
113,12,9,Mr Garrison,And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
114,12,9,Clyde Donovan,"I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school."
115,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[a revelation] Detention! That's it! [begins to fidget: ""I've gotta get detention, fast!"" The minute hand hits 0 and Cartman runs out of his seat towards the front of the class. He gets on Mr. Garrison's desk, shoves the Homework Assignments holder off the desk, lowers his pants, and leaves a nice brown gift on the desk. Mr. Garrison looks at him. The class is stunned as Cartman looks back at Mr. Garrison]"
116,12,9,Mr Garrison,"Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?"
117,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[strikes some gang poses] Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? [Wendy's especially shocked. No one says a word until...]"
118,12,9,Butters Stotch,[cocks his head to his right] Huh.
119,12,9,Mr Mackey,"Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. [walks away]"
120,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[puts his feet up on the table and his hands behind his head, certain he's gotten out of the fight with Wendy] Ahhh, sweet."
121,12,9,Butters Stotch,"[a door opens and his voice is heard] Eric. Hey Eric. [the camera shows Butters motioning Cartman over. Craig and Jimmy are behind him. Cartman looks over at them, then leaves his seat and walks to the door] Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy."
122,12,9,Eric Cartman,What?! That's ridiculous!
123,12,9,Butters Stotch,"But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight."
124,12,9,Eric Cartman,That's not why I did it.
125,12,9,Craig Tucker,Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
126,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[begins to pose] Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that."
127,12,9,Butters Stotch,"That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"""
128,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude."
129,12,9,Craig Tucker,"Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow."
130,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
131,12,9,Eric Cartman,[shocked] Huh?
132,12,9,Butters Stotch,That way it won't matter if you get detention.
133,12,9,Mr Mackey,"[finds him] Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!"
134,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! [they walk away and the doors close. Cartman stands there for a moment, then returns to his seat. There's a rapping at the window and Cartman looks over]"
135,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[outside] Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! [walks away. Cartman is truly scared]
136,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,Wendy?
137,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah?
138,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"We need to talk to you, right now. [Wendy leaves her chair and her room, and goes downstairs. Her parents are waiting for her, quite displeased] Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school?"
139,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,What? No!
140,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us? [Wendy looks and sees Cartman and Liane seated on the sofa. Cartman is sobbing quietly]"
141,12,9,Mr Testaburger,Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?!
142,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,You don't understand. He said horrible things.
143,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[whining] The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him]"
144,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?"
145,12,9,Eric Cartman,"The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him again]"
146,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him!"
147,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Mom, you don't-"
148,12,9,Mrs Testaburger,"Now, young lady."
149,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I'm not going to hurt you.
150,12,9,Mr Testaburger,"If there is any word of you fighting at school it's over for you, missy! Do you understand?!"
151,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yes sir.
152,12,9,Mr Testaburger,"We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman."
153,12,9,Liane Cartman,"Oh no, thank you so much for your time. [Cartman looks at Wendy, then makes faces at her and sticks both middle fingers up at her. Wendy gets pissed off, but can't do anything now]"
154,12,9,Mr Testaburger,It won't happen again.
155,12,9,Liane Cartman,"You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. [stops making faces and looks up at her, then joins her as she walks to the front door]"
156,12,9,Eric Cartman,Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
157,12,9,Butters Stotch,Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
158,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up."
159,12,9,Bebe Stevens,Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
160,12,9,An Older Girl,Here she comes! [everyone looks to their right and see Wendy approaching.]
161,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[begins to strike poses as Wendy walks by] What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight."
162,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[stops and looks at him] You know I can't fight you!
163,12,9,Eric Cartman,Why not? You chicken? [begins to strut and cluck like a chicken]
164,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
165,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!"
166,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!"
167,12,9,Eric Cartman,"I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo."
168,12,9,Bebe Stevens,"Come on Wendy, kick his ass!"
169,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I can't! [the school bell rings and she walks towards the building] God damn it!
170,12,9,Butters Stotch,She chickened out!
171,12,9,Other students,Aw man. [they follow her into the building and towards class]
172,12,9,Eric Cartman,Told you guys.
173,12,9,Stan Marsh,"Ugh, I'm glad that's over with."
174,12,9,Pete,"[walking by with the other Goths] Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad."
175,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
176,12,9,Clyde Donovan,"And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. [the class applauds politely as he takes his seat. Wendy has her face buried in her arms]"
177,12,9,Mr Garrison,"Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go? [Cartman smiles and silently raises his hand] Okay Eric. [Cartman happily gets out of his seat and goes to face the class]"
178,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[clears his throat] Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness. [Wendy lifts her head up in surprise] I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest. [stifles a laugh] We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. [stifles a laugh again]"
179,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[softly] You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
180,12,9,Eric Cartman,What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
181,12,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay Eric, that's enough you smartass!"
182,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Why?! [leaves her seat and walks up to Cartman] Why are you doing this to me?! [grabs him by the collar and shakes him] Why won't you just stop?!
183,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[cautioning] Wendy, Wendy."
184,12,9,Principal Victoria,[through the school's PA system] Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
185,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,God! [Cartman cackles as she leaves]
186,12,9,Principal Victoria,"Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman."
187,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,"No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight."
188,12,9,Principal Victoria,Oh no? Are you sure?
189,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Yes ma'am!
190,12,9,Principal Victoria,I see. [gets up and walks to the window and looks out] I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
191,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,Ma'am?
192,12,9,Principal Victoria,"I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed. [Faces Wendy] When there is a cancer, you have to ""fight"" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you."
193,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[thinks a moment] My... parents said that if I fight-
194,12,9,Principal Victoria,"And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you. [turns back to the window] You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will [turns back to Wendy] take everything. Do you understand?"
195,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[the look of determination appears on her face and she makes her hands into fists] Yes ma'am!
196,12,9,Principal Victoria,"When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!"
197,12,9,Bebe Stevens,She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
198,12,9,Millie Larsen,"What? [the other kids in the hall turn and everyone heads outside. Other classes hear about this and clear out, chattering all the while. Wendy leads the pack towards the playground. While still in the building she takes off her jacket and throws it aside. On her blouse is a purple prancing unicorn connected to some orange stars by a yellow rainbow]"
199,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Go deep, Craig. [throws the football at Craig, who is off-screen] Not that deep, retard!"
200,12,9,Butters Stotch,[runs up to Cartman smiling] She's coming! She's coming!
201,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Butters, get out of here!"
202,12,9,Butters Stotch,But Wendy's coming to fight you.
203,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[in disbelief] ...Huh? [Butters turns left and looks at the building, smiling. Cartman looks to his right. The side doors fly open and Wendy walks down the steps spoiling for a fight. The students cheer her on as she turns left and heads for the playground. Some girls trail behind her, Bebe being the first among them.]"
204,12,9,Clyde Donovan,Oh boy here we go!
205,12,9,Butters Stotch,"All right! [other kids chatter around them. The Goth kids find some good spots along the brick wall. Red Goth and Kindergoth sit atop the wall, Tall Goth and Henrietta remain on the ground next to it]"
206,12,9,Pete,It's about freaking time. [Wendy walks up to Cartman and they face off]
207,12,9,Craig Tucker,"All right, let's DO IT!"
208,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[wavering] What- what's up? [begins posing] What what's up? [draws close to her and cautions in a whisper] Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you."
209,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,I don't care! [Cartman looks around. Butters gleefully dances in place waiting for the fight to start]
210,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time."
211,12,9,A Girl,Shut up and fight! [everyone else joins in the demand. Wendy ties her hair up in a small bun behind her head]
212,12,9,Eric Cartman,"All right, fine Wendy! [takes off his jacket] I'll fight ya you big bully!"
213,12,9,The Goth Kids,Ohhhhh!
214,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Fuck him up, Wendy!"
215,12,9,Mr Mackey,[just arriving] Wendy?
216,12,9,Wendy Testaburger,[pants and looks back at Mr. Mackey] I'm finished! [gets up and walks away. The girls look at her with astonishment]
217,12,9,Mr Mackey,"Eh somebod - somebody call the principal! [Cartman gets up, sniffling. Some of the kids begin to leave. Cartman looks around]"
218,12,9,Eric Cartman,[demoralized] You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag. [begins to wail] My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. [wails some more]
219,12,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we never thought you were cool."
220,12,9,Eric Cartman,That's not true. You're just saying that.
221,12,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, really. We've always thought you suck."
222,12,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower."
223,12,9,Eric Cartman,You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
224,12,9,Craig Tucker,"No, it's true. We've always hated you."
225,12,9,Butters Stotch,"Well, yeah."
226,12,9,Eric Cartman,"Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. [the guys look at each other, sure that Cartman misunderstood them]"
227,12,9,Craig Tucker,What?
228,12,9,Eric Cartman,"[seeing a positive side to this somehow] If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief! [jumps up and clicks his feet up in the air] Oh, yay! [jumps up again]"
