0,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. [a cheer goes up in the audience]"
1,12,12,Randy Marsh,Yyeeaahh!!!! [pumps his beer can up and down a couple of times] Obama! [runs around] WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
2,12,12,Gerald Broflovski,[stands up] Yyeeaahh!!!!
3,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America."
4,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!"
5,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him ""Sparkles""."
6,12,12,Randy Marsh,[kneels before the TV] He's so awesome! [runs his hand over the screen a few times] He's so perfect and awesome!
7,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we canâ€™t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can."
8,12,12,Supporters for Obama (the Revelers) and McCain,[in Chicago] Yes we can!
9,12,12,Randy Marsh,Yes I can! Yes I can! [the others watch him run out of the house]
10,12,12,Randy Marsh,Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! [people nearby gather around the front steps]
11,12,12,Mr Harris,Did you see? Our man is in! [among the gathering crowd are Mr. Adler and the Blacks.]
12,12,12,Mrs Harris,We did it!
13,12,12,Mr Adler,Everything is going to be awesome now!
14,12,12,Randy Marsh,This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
15,12,12,Linda Black,I don't even know what to do now.
16,12,12,Randy Marsh,I know what to do! [steps into the street and cups his hands on his cheeks so as to amplify his voice] Losers! Looosers!
17,12,12,Crowd,[outside] Looosers! Looosers!
18,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, shut up!"
19,12,12,Crowd,Looosers!
20,12,12,Butters Stotch,We lost?
21,12,12,Senator John McCain,"[giving his concession speech] It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours."
22,12,12,Supporters for Obama (the Revelers) and McCain,No no! Noo nooo!
23,12,12,Butters Stotch,"Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad."
24,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"[gets up and walks to the TV] No. No, this can't happen! No! [kicks the TV screen, causing it to short and shatter]"
25,12,12,Linda Stotch,Stephen!
26,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead."
27,12,12,Linda Stotch,"You don't know that, Stephen!"
28,12,12,Mr Mackey,"With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!"
29,12,12,Mr Garrison,We'll probably be dead by sunrise!
30,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... [someone pounds on the door. Stephen and Butters look over and the door opens. It's Randy]"
31,12,12,Randy Marsh,WOOOO Obama!
32,12,12,Mr Garrison,Get out o'here!
33,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, have you seen my parents? [Ike begins to cry]"
34,12,12,Stan Marsh,"No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?"
35,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"He was a McCain supporter. [Ike cries harder] It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine."
36,12,12,Reporter 1,"Uh Mr. President, over here!"
37,12,12,Reporter 2,Congratulations!
38,12,12,Reporter 3,"Great start, great job!"
39,12,12,Reporter 4,Change!
40,12,12,Reporter 5,"Great job, Mr. President!"
41,12,12,Reporter 6,"Great job, Obama!"
42,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest. [steps through double doors at the other end of the hall and closes them behind him. A man walks out of the shadows as Obama turns away from the doors] Senator McCain."
43,12,12,Senator John McCain,"President Obama. [the two men step up and face each other, then start to giggle, then roar with laughter. They give each other a high-five and a low-five.]"
44,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Boom, baby!"
45,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Boom, baby!"
46,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Ohoh man that was perfect! [works on removing his jacket]
47,12,12,Senator John McCain,[pulls out a cell phone and starts calling someone] I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.
48,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"You played it perfectly, there was no way."
49,12,12,Senator John McCain,"It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President."
50,12,12,Davis,"Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?"
51,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours."
52,12,12,Davis,"Sure. Hard part's over, right?"
53,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Actually, the hard part's just starting."
54,12,12,Reveler 1,[gulps down a beer] Yoohoo!
55,12,12,Reveler 2,"Obama yeah, I can't believe it!"
56,12,12,Randy Marsh,O ba ma! O ba ma!
57,12,12,Revelers,O ba ma! O ba ma!
58,12,12,Randy Marsh,Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on! [reaches a keg of beer and serves himself some into a mug] It's Obamobama! [someone walks by and just throws up]
59,12,12,Stan Marsh,"Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. [outside the music changes to ""Who Let The Dogs Out?"" Someone swings from a traffic light and falls. A truck full of young adults rolls by]"
60,12,12,Crowd,Obama!
61,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Who let the Obama out? [moments later a police car rolls down the street, slowly going through the crowd] Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!"
62,12,12,Crowd,OooooOOOOooo! [Officer Barbrady stops the cruiser and hops out of it]
63,12,12,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!"
64,12,12,Randy Marsh,BOOOO! [other people join in the booing]
65,12,12,Reveler,...party Obama!
66,12,12,Officer Barbrady,"Come on, time to go home."
67,12,12,Randy Marsh,What are you? A McCain voter?
68,12,12,Crowd,Yeah!
69,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Sorry pal, but Obama's President now! [walks towards Barbrady, and his pants begin to fall to his ankles] Obama! Obama! [walks past him and towards the police car]"
70,12,12,Crowd,Obama! Obama!
71,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! [other revelers walk up and help out]"
72,12,12,Officer Barbrady,"Ey, put down my car! [Randy and the revelers succeed in flipping the car over]"
73,12,12,Revelers,"Yes we can! [they move in and keep rocking the car as the music switches to ""Mickey"".]"
74,12,12,Officer Barbrady,"No! No! Hey, stop it!"
75,12,12,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ...
76,12,12,Randy Marsh,"O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! [Cartman rolls by in his Big Wheels trike, pulling a cart full of TVs]"
77,12,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]"
78,12,12,Quincy,Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!
79,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever."
80,12,12,Neely,I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.
81,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Always workin' the angles.
82,12,12,Senator John McCain,"My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history."
83,12,12,Quincy,"So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time? [Obama and McCain look at each other knowingly. The next scene shows a huge diamond necklace]"
84,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars."
85,12,12,Davis,Two hundred ten?
86,12,12,Senator John McCain,Million.
87,12,12,Quincy,"No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that."
88,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built. [Two security guards go around closing the exhibits for the night] The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system. [the guards walk out of a room and turn on the laser system as they exit] There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached."
89,12,12,Davis,"So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top."
90,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.
91,12,12,Quincy,"Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond. [Obama walks over to the computer and turns it on, stepping aside for McCain]"
92,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel, [a simulation begins to play on the computer monitors] A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum."
93,12,12,Neely,"Boom, baby!"
94,12,12,Davis,"Boom, baby!"
95,12,12,Senator John McCain,"You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on."
96,12,12,Quincy,"So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel."
97,12,12,Senator John McCain,And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
98,12,12,Quincy,This all sounds very risky.
99,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,[walks across the floor] We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-
100,12,12,Neely,And we are.
101,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,[turns around] -we won't get caught.
102,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won."
103,12,12,Stan Marsh,"[walks in from the dining room] Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here."
104,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
105,12,12,Stan Marsh,Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
106,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God! [drops the phone and follows Stan to Ike]
107,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for! [Ike begins to cry] I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay. [Ike mumbles something to him] No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan. [Ike says something more] Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something. [The camera zooms out to show that the window is barely off the ground. Ike cries, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it."
108,12,12,Ike Broflovski|nab,Good-bye. [falls from the window sill and lands on the ground face down]
109,12,12,Stan Marsh,NOO!
110,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,NOO!
111,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,Ike? [no response] Oh crap Ike?
112,12,12,Chief of Security,"All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3."
113,12,12,SS Agent,"Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem."
114,12,12,Chief of Security,What?
115,12,12,SS Agent,The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office.
116,12,12,Chief of Security,Barack Obama? [next scene shows Barack Obama walking through the White House]
117,12,12,SS Agent 2,"They're all, they're all right through here, sir."
118,12,12,Chief of Security,"[interrupting as Obama enters] Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama?"
119,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?
120,12,12,Chief of Security,"Good, sir."
121,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?"
122,12,12,Chief of Security,Right now?
123,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff."
124,12,12,Chief of Security,"[backs up towards the Oval Office] Sure, right this way, Mr... President. [opens the doors to the office]"
125,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"[enters the office] I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?"
126,12,12,Chief of Security,Yes sir. [Obama places a bill into the Chief's jacket breast pocket]
127,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Thanks. [closes the doors]
128,12,12,Chief of Security,I got a hundred dollars. [grins]
129,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"All right, McCain. I'm in."
130,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian. [he's with a construction team] You find the escape tunnel?"
131,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,I'm already on it. [plugs a hacking device into an electronic lock hidden under a panel on the desktop; it quickly starts crunching numbers in trying to decode the password. Once it decodes the right password the desk moves to one side and the secret passage is revealed] Boom baby.
132,12,12,Reveler 3,Yehhheheah!
133,12,12,Randy Marsh,"[even more drunk than before, serves himself more beer] Wooo, change."
134,12,12,Reveler 4,Change.
135,12,12,Reveler 5,Change.
136,12,12,Stan Marsh,"[running up to him with Kyle] Dad Dad, we have a problem."
137,12,12,Randy Marsh,Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
138,12,12,Stan Marsh,"No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital."
139,12,12,Randy Marsh,"We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore."
140,12,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's wasted."
141,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! [walks over]"
142,12,12,Randy s Boss,"Oh, hello Marsh."
143,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! [Stan and Kyle are stunned]"
144,12,12,Randy s Boss,Huh?
145,12,12,Randy Marsh,"You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!"
146,12,12,Stan Marsh,"[quite concerned] Dad, what are you doing?!"
147,12,12,Randy Marsh,"It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit [gives him the finger again] You know what Obama said? Yes we can!"
148,12,12,Randy s Boss,"Hey, I voted for Obama."
149,12,12,Randy Marsh,Obama's not talkin' about you!
150,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks around] Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. [Randy punches his boss in the face and his boss just leaves, holding his hands over his nose]"
151,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009. [the cameras die down and everyone is a bit aghast at her statement]
152,12,12,Reporter 1,"Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?"
153,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,"Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but [her cell phone begins to ring] Oh, my phone's going ringy. Ex-cuse me. [steps away from the podium and off the stage to her left. She answers the phone at a safe distance from the stage] Hello?"
154,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Hello Sarah, it's McCain."
155,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,[switches to a British accent] I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.
156,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum."
157,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.
158,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,God she's awesome.
159,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,"[returns to the podium and a normal voice] Oh, I guess Senator McCain's gonna fly me back to Alaska now. He's got a private jet, you know? Okay, byebye then. [walks off to her right] Bloody idiots. [she walks out of the headquarters through a side door, tosses off her red business suit and walks towards the camera in a catsuit. She whips out some sais and spins them around like pistols]"
160,12,12,Senator John McCain,"All right, here we go. [a piledriver is turned on and a massive pile is lifted up, then dropped. Shockwaves spread out each time the pile hits the ground]"
161,12,12,Guard 1,What's that noise?
162,12,12,Guard 2,"It's okay, just some construction outside. [Obama prepares a charge and sets it off, and light enters the tunnel. Obama has broken into the Smithsonian. He pops his head through the hole]"
163,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Oh no. [presses a button on his headset] McCain? We've got a problem. [the lasers are now blue instead of red]
164,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help."
165,12,12,Stan Marsh,"[points ahead] Hey, there's some people. [ahead of them is a garage that has been converted into a cave. Stephen Stotch and the other McCain supporters are there putting stuff away. Stephen is holding a crowd of other McCain supporters at bay with a rifle.]"
166,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. [above the garage door is the work ""A.RK""]"
167,12,12,Supporter 1,You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!
168,12,12,Woman Supporter 1,Who are you to turn us away?!
169,12,12,Stephen Stotch,I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
170,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, excuse me, but we need some help."
171,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!"
172,12,12,Supporter 2,You're going to deny them too?
173,12,12,Supporter 1,"[throws down his sleeping bag] For God's sake, man, they're children! [kneels next to Stan] Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't take them in! [tugs on Stan's cheeks] Look at their little cheeks!"
174,12,12,Stan Marsh,"Let go of my face, asshole!"
175,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"All right, damn you! The children can come in!"
176,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!"
177,12,12,Supporter 3,"Okay, then I want their place."
178,12,12,Supporter 4,Me too.
179,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,We NEED a ride to the hospital!
180,12,12,Supporter 1,THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A HOSPITAL! DON'T YOU GET IT?!
181,12,12,Woman Supporter 2,"Let us in now! [Stephen smacks her away, and a brawl follows]"
182,12,12,Mr Garrison,"Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!"
183,12,12,Supporter 5,Obama hasn't been elected four hours and already the country's going to hell! [another supporter smacks him down from behind. Stan and Kyle just leave and resume their walk]
184,12,12,Chief of Security,"Mr. Obama? [tries to open it, but can't] Sir? [looks to another Secret Service agent] All right, give me the keys. [the door opens before the agent could reach for the keys. Barack Obama dusts himself off]"
185,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Is there a problem, gentlemen?"
186,12,12,Chief of Security,"Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?"
187,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?"
188,12,12,Chief of Security,"Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here."
189,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,My wife?
190,12,12,Michelle Obama,"[appears behind the agents] Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?"
191,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"[pulls her into the Oval Office] Uh, c-c-come on in, darling. [appears at the doorway again] Thank, thank you boys. [closes and locks the doors]"
192,12,12,Michelle Obama,"Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?"
193,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Michelle, there's something I need to tell you."
194,12,12,Michelle Obama,"What is it? [Obama stays quiet] Barack, what is it?!"
195,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.
196,12,12,Michelle Obama,You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?
197,12,12,Senator John McCain,"[wearing a huge fake mustache] Hi, Michelle."
198,12,12,Michelle Obama,[removes the Bluetooth device from Obama's right ear and places it on her own] You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!
199,12,12,Senator John McCain,"Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay."
200,12,12,Michelle Obama,"On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!"
201,12,12,Governor Sarah Palin,"Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes."
202,12,12,Michelle Obama,Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.
203,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Did you catch that, Davis?"
204,12,12,Davis,I'm on it.
205,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. [they enter the ER and see a lot of patients in there. One man has an Obama flag stuck up his ass. The clock reads 9 p.m., so it must be broken]"
206,12,12,Nurse at Hell's Pass Hospital,"[showing an Obama patient where to wait] There, just take a seat over there."
207,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[getting the nurse's attention] E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention."
208,12,12,Nurse at Hell's Pass Hospital,Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?
209,12,12,Stan Marsh,Why does that matter?
210,12,12,Nurse at Hell's Pass Hospital,"Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. [on one side of the ER are Obama supporters who are suffering the effects of too much partying, and on the other are McCain supporters who have more serious wounds]"
211,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help."
212,12,12,Nurse at Hell's Pass Hospital,"You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere."
213,12,12,Stan Marsh,So where's the other doctor? [the nurse opens a door behind her and the other doctor... is hanging from a noose attached to the ceiling]
214,12,12,Randy Marsh,"[walking in suddenly towards the Obama side] Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking. [moans come up from all over the ER as people cover their ears] And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. [a McCain supporter tries to hasten his death by smashing a corkscrew into his head]"
215,12,12,Michelle Obama,I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?
216,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Did you really not like pretending to be married?
217,12,12,Michelle Obama,"Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B."
218,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.
219,12,12,Michelle Obama,"My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it."
220,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"[to everyone connected to his bluetooth unit] All right, everyone. We're about to go. So here's the revised schedule: 4:40 a.m., the team gathers at the northwest exit of the museum. [the heist is shown taking place as Obama goes through the schedule] 4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors."
221,12,12,Michelle Obama,Go! [Obama takes off]
222,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew. [Obama opens the vault door and McCain and the others walk in] 5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum."
223,12,12,Grandma Obama,"I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch."
224,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs. [above them, Palin crawls across the ceiling like Spider-Man towards the entrance] 5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm. [Palin drops down and hangs upside down. She lifts the glass display cover from the diamond and swipes the Hope Diamond from its display case. McCain is spotted and flees]"
225,12,12,A Guard,Hey you! Stop!
226,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched. [Davis and Neely act as repairmen and seal up the hole] 5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus."
227,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"[to the Secret Service] All done. Thanks. [Barack and Michelle head outside, towards a limousine. The door opens and McCain is waiting for them. They enter and take their seats, and the limousine rolls off. The rest of the team looks at the three of them, and they all laugh. Obama takes the diamond out of his ass and displays it for all to see.]"
228,12,12,All,"Boom, baby!"
229,12,12,Quincy,There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?
230,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago. [a plane sits all by itself in a field somewhere. The interior is full of dummies. Nearby, in a recovery room, Ike rises from his bed as Stan and Kyle look off into space. He presses a button and the plane blows up: the plane was landed near Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan and Kyle hear the explosion and quickly turn around and look outside]"
231,12,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell? [they observe the burning plane. Ike sneaks away while the boys are distracted. He dashes across the hall to the coroner's office and enters it. He hops onto a chair and attaches a USB stick to a computer, and begins typing. Dossiers of the heist team members pop up and Ike classifies each one as deceased. The door opens, and Kyle and Stan enter] Ike?"
232,12,12,Ike Broflovski|nab,"Boom, baby."
233,12,12,Flight Attendant,"Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez."
234,12,12,Senator John McCain,Thank you very much.
235,12,12,Quincy,"Well friends, let us depart."
236,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye."
237,12,12,Neely,Wha?
238,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot."
239,12,12,Senator John McCain,"B, you can't be serious."
240,12,12,Quincy,"Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember?"
241,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,"Could have been I didn't make that flight. [walks up to Michelle] What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while."
242,12,12,Michelle Obama,You're serious.
243,12,12,Senator Barack Obama,Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?
244,12,12,Michelle Obama,"Aww, what the fuck. [they begin to kiss, and the other members of the team wave goodbye and head for the plane]"
245,12,12,Senator John McCain,I just looove happy endings.
246,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"It's still here, ih... it's all still here."
247,12,12,Mr Garrison,Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?
248,12,12,Stephen Stotch,"No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right."
249,12,12,Randy Marsh,"Uhh... [sits up and tries to rub his eyes, but he's got a headache] Oh ow. [walks forward...] Hey, where are my pants? [looks at the table the TV is missing from] Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!"
250,12,12,Stan Marsh,"Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired."
251,12,12,Randy Marsh,"[surprised] Oh! [is pissed off again] Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! [kicks a side table away and walks off]"
