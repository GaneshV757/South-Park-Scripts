0,12,1,Eric Cartman,AHHHHHH.
1,12,1,Dentist,"Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out."
2,12,1,Eric Cartman,What?
3,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?"
4,12,1,Dentist,"It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!"
5,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!"
6,12,1,Dentist,"Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?"
7,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!"
8,12,1,Dentist,"Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either."
9,12,1,Eric Cartman,...Ice cream?
10,12,1,Dentist,It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.
11,12,1,Liane Cartman,"What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?"
12,12,1,Eric Cartman,Well...you did say free ice cream? [Dentist and Liane laugh]
13,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey."
14,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[Opening his eyes, blinking a lot] Uh. It's over?"
15,12,1,Liane Cartman,"That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!"
16,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[Eyes fully open, sitting up] Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!"
17,12,1,Liane Cartman,"I'm so proud of you, Eric."
18,12,1,Eric Cartman,"All right, so where's my ice cream?"
19,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor."
20,12,1,Eric Cartman,"You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!"
21,12,1,Doctor,"No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus."
22,12,1,Liane Cartman,...What!?
23,12,1,Eric Cartman,What's that supposed to mean?!
24,12,1,Doctor,During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.
25,12,1,Eric Cartman,I HAVE AIDS?
26,12,1,Doctor,"Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry."
27,12,1,Eric Cartman,"""SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!"
28,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, my poor little baby!"
29,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!"
30,12,1,Liane Cartman,Oh God! [Cries] Oh no!
31,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!"
32,12,1,Doctor,"We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream. [One of the doctors brings over a plate with two sundaes on it, leaving it on Cartman's bed.]"
33,12,1,Eric Cartman,[Knocks the ice cream on the ground] Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
34,12,1,Liane Cartman,"[Sobbing] Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!"
35,12,1,Eric Cartman,NO! NOOOOOOOO!
36,12,1,Principal Victoria,"Thank you for coming, everyone. [Stan, Kyle, Butters and Kenny walk in.]"
37,12,1,Principal Victoria,"Boys, please take a seat."
38,12,1,Stan Marsh,[The boys sit down.] What's going on? Are we in trouble?
39,12,1,Principal Victoria,"Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV."
40,12,1,Stan Marsh,[All five boys are surprised.] ...What?
41,12,1,Butters Stotch,Oh no.
42,12,1,Doctor 2,"He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared."
43,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman has HIV?
44,12,1,Doctor 2,"We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-"
45,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
46,12,1,Principal Victoria,"All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?"
47,12,1,Mr Mackey,"[Opens the back door] Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say ""Hi"", m'kay? [Eric walks into the room with a black baseball cap, a gray scarf, and an annoyed look. Everyone greets him.]"
48,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,...No. Way.
49,12,1,Butters Stotch,"[Walks over to Cartman, putting an arm around his shoulder] How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. [Smiles and kisses Cartman on the cheek, much to his horror]"
50,12,1,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, this sucks ass!"
51,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. [Leaves the room and begins laughing in the hallway. It can be heard from in the room.]"
52,12,1,Butters Stotch,Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
53,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!"
54,12,1,Doctor 2,"No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-"
55,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!"
56,12,1,M C,"We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV. [there's hardly anyone there: just his mom, Butters, Jimmy, and two other adults.]"
57,12,1,Eric Cartman,Where the hell is everybody? [a waitress arrives with some food]
58,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?"
59,12,1,Waitress,This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.
60,12,1,Butters Stotch,"Great benefit, Eric!"
61,12,1,Jimmy Valmer,The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
62,12,1,Eric Cartman,So this is it?
63,12,1,Waitress,I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now. [leaves]
64,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!"
65,12,1,M C,"With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman."
66,12,1,Eric Cartman,Just bring out Elton John already!
67,12,1,M C,"Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit."
68,12,1,Waitress,"It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!"
69,12,1,Eric Cartman,Jimmy Buffett?!
70,12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
AIDSburger in paradise!
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!"
71,12,1,Eric Cartman,Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
72,12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"A little boy in South Park
Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue.
Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff
How are we all feelin' tonight?"
73,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[sticks his middle finger up in the air] Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!"
74,12,1,Liane Cartman,"Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice."
75,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!"
76,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday."
77,12,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot."
78,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease."
79,12,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?"
80,12,1,Eric Cartman,"...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead. [Kyle bursts out laughing; Cartman angrily approaches him] Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!"
81,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[trying to stop laughing long enough to say something] I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly."
82,12,1,Eric Cartman,No you don't!
83,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,I do. [smiles and keeps from laughing]
84,12,1,Eric Cartman,"If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face! [the smirk is having trouble not breaking into a laugh] Well any God damned second, Kyle!"
85,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry. I gotta go home. [laughs, turns away and leaves. His laughter trails off]"
86,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[watched Kyle leave] Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!"
87,12,1,Stan Marsh,"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic."
88,12,1,Eric Cartman,Ironic how?
89,12,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now..."
90,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[spins around and gets in Stan's face] Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!"
91,12,1,Stan Marsh,"[backs away a bit] Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks."
92,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[advances] Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!"
93,12,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, uh-okay, it's clear."
94,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[comes into view also dressed as a cat burglar] All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. [they head towards the sliding door]"
95,12,1,Butters Stotch,"Okay, but... what are you going to do?"
96,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at."
97,12,1,Butters Stotch,I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
98,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do."
99,12,1,Butters Stotch,"I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?"
100,12,1,Eric Cartman,"I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive."
101,12,1,Butters Stotch,"[reflects on the answer] Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true."
102,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[gets down to business] All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access."
103,12,1,Butters Stotch,"Wow, you really know what you're doing."
104,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times. [moments later, Cartman is shown moving up along the outer wall to Kyle's window. He stops and opens the window gingerly, silently steps onto Kyle's bed, and walks over to Kyle's face. Then he whispers] You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well... [reaches into his back pack, pulls out a syringe, rolls up the sleeves on his left arm and...] let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. [...draws some blood into it and drops the blood into Kyle's mouth. Kyle instinctively tastes it and swallows it. Cartman quickly goes back out the window and slams it shut as Kyle wakes up.]"
105,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Wagh.
106,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"There there, bubbe, you'll be okay. [a doctor walks into the room] Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?"
107,12,1,Dr Doctor,"No, it isn't strep..."
108,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, well there's a relief."
109,12,1,Dr Doctor,"...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?"
110,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"No, why?"
111,12,1,Dr Doctor,"[walks around to Kyle's end of the bed] Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?"
112,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What? No?!
113,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Doctor, what are you saying?"
114,12,1,Dr Doctor,[walks up to Sheila] We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
115,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?
116,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,HIV?
117,12,1,Dr Doctor,"It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt."
118,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,"No, that's impossible!"
119,12,1,Dr Doctor,"[addresses Kyle] Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?"
120,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe... [his eyes open wide at the realization] Oh my God. That son of a bitch! [hops off the bed and rushes out the door]"
121,12,1,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle? Kyle!
122,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Pass me the ball! [Kyle runs in from a distance...] Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole! [...and shoves Cartman forward at full speed. Cartman falls on his face, then looks back at Kyle.] Kyle, what the F?!"
123,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!"
124,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, what?!"
125,12,1,Stan Marsh,[steps into view] What did he do?
126,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why do I have HIV?!
127,12,1,Clyde Donovan,...Oh...
128,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?"
129,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What did you do?!
130,12,1,Eric Cartman,Nothing!
131,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! [Behind Cartman, Butters motions Kyle not to say anything further]"
132,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. [too late. Butters stops motioning]"
133,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
134,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-"
135,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[lunges at Cartman] AAAAAAA! [start punching him mercilessly]
136,12,1,Eric Cartman,Kyle!
137,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[doesn't let up] Here you go! [punch] Here you go! [punch. Mr. Mackey walks into the fray]
138,12,1,Mr Mackey,"Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?! [tries to separate the boys...] Break it up! Hm'kay?! [...but ends up hoisting them away together at each other's throats] M'kay!"
139,12,1,Principal Victoria,"All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?"
140,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[pointing to Cartman] He gave me AIDS!
141,12,1,Principal Victoria,What?
142,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
143,12,1,Principal Victoria,"Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?"
144,12,1,Eric Cartman,Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
145,12,1,Principal Victoria,"[pointedly] Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!"
146,12,1,Eric Cartman,[grudgingly] Kind of.
147,12,1,Mr Mackey,"Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!"
148,12,1,Principal Victoria,That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
149,12,1,Eric Cartman,[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
150,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,An apology?!
151,12,1,Principal Victoria,"You're sorry for what, Eric?"
152,12,1,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle."
153,12,1,Principal Victoria,"That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling."
154,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[can't believe these adults] ...What?!
155,12,1,Mr Mackey,"Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?"
156,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
157,12,1,Eric Cartman,See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. [they are shown the door]
158,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[keeping pace with Kyle] Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now? [stops] Kyle, where are you going?"
159,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around and returns to Cartman, then says between gritted teeth] I'm going to break everything that you own! [spins around and walks away]"
160,12,1,Eric Cartman,"What's that supposed to mean? Kyle? [settles on the obvious] Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!"
161,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole! [Kyle enters Cartman's room and begins breaking anything he sees. First, a toy rocket. Then, he grabs a poster of Braveheart from the wall and rips it apart. Next, he grabs the Wellington Bear Magic Mic and smashes it on the floor. Cartman walks in.] What the fuck are you doing?! [picks up some of his broken toys. Kyle knocks over a box of small toys] Kyle, stop it! [Kyle breaks apart a toy Mountie after three tries] God damn it, don't! [Kyle walks over to Cartman's big toy box, grabs Clyde Frog,..] Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone! [...and rips its head right off and moves off.] NO!! [Cartman picks up the two halves of his plush frog as Kyle moves to the XBOX] AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle! [Kyle picks it up and tries to pull it out of the power socket] Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND! [stops Kyle before Kyle gets to smash the XBOX on the floor] I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!"
162,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"There is no cure, you asshole!"
163,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope."
164,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What hope?!
165,12,1,Eric Cartman,Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
166,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,You're lying!
167,12,1,Eric Cartman,"NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson."
168,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Magic Johnson?
169,12,1,Eric Cartman,He was a basketball player.
170,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,So what?!
171,12,1,Eric Cartman,"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy. [grabs Kyle's shoulder] You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!"
172,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at the XBOX for a few moments, then] You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!"
173,12,1,Eric Cartman,[stunned] My God...
174,12,1,Eric Cartman,We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
175,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,"Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each."
176,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS."
177,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,"...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats."
178,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!"
179,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!"
180,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,"Oh, you boys are [sticks his left index finger into a tube he makes with his right hand and moves it in and out of the tube] like that, huh?"
181,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,NO!
182,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
183,12,1,Eric Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive."
184,12,1,Delta Airlines Clerk,"Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?"
185,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! [turns around and leaves Kyle standing there]"
186,12,1,Flight Attendant,We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?
187,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh uh, you know, all over cancer."
188,12,1,Flight Attendant,I'm so sorry
189,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, at least [leans into the aisle and looks back at the other passengers] it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease."
190,12,1,Flight Attendant,"Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer."
191,12,1,Eric Cartman,"No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here! [the flight attendant turns and walks away] We're on our way, buddy. [puts his left hand on Kyle's right hand] Magic Johnson, here we come."
192,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Don't. Touch me.
193,12,1,Eric Cartman,[removes his hand from Kyle's and places his hands together over his stomach] I know. I'm scared too.
194,12,1,Magic's Butler,"Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. [Magic sheds a big tear and sniffs]"
195,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[moments later] Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease."
196,12,1,Magic Johnson,You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?
197,12,1,Eric Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive."
198,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[quickly irritated] Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
199,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, we need to try to find a-"
200,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
201,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[thinks for a few seconds] I don't think it's funny, Kyle."
202,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive! [Cartman keeps quiet] This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!"
203,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[clears his throat] Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-"
204,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
205,12,1,Eric Cartman,[waits a second] Are you sure?
206,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[quickly] Yes!!
207,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[waits a second] Are you HIV-positive? [Kyle smacks him] Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!"
208,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't. [shrugs]"
209,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
210,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Well, not at all."
211,12,1,Magic Johnson,"The pool is over there [motions to his left], where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen [motions to his right] is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all."
212,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
213,12,1,Magic Johnson,Sure.
214,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom. [before them is the four-post bed with curtains, and stacks of dollar bills everywhere else]"
215,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude.
216,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money."
217,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,You sleep with money. Every night?
218,12,1,Magic Johnson,"Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?"
219,12,1,Scientist 1,"[changes focus] It's incredible. Mitch, these boys could be onto something. Take a look. [Mitch steps in and looks into the microscope] That's a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right? [the HIV is indeed attacking] All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash. [waves a brick of bills around near the microscope]"
220,12,1,Mitch and AIDS Research Scientists,"My God. The HIV particles are receding! [the particles scream as they sense the money, and leave the white blood cells alone]"
221,12,1,Scientist 1,The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.
222,12,1,Scientist 2,"Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it."
223,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe..."
224,12,1,Mitch and AIDS Research Scientists,Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.
225,12,1,Magic Johnson,I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!
226,12,1,Scientist 2,"Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!"
227,12,1,Magic Johnson,These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen. [genuflects next to them] Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.
228,12,1,Scientist 2,"[sighs heavily and puts his hands on a lab table] Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure."
229,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,[looks away] Wugh.
230,12,1,Scientist 2,I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.
231,12,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk."
232,12,1,Mitch and AIDS Research Scientists,"Let's hope to Christ this works. [...walks over to Kyle, kneels next to him, and injects him with the liquid. Moments later, a sample of Kyle's blood is taken and analyzed]"
233,12,1,Scientist 1,"Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look! [he trades places with Scientist 2, who looks into the microscope] The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood! [the newly repaired blood cells look like discs cut out of dollar bills. Scientist 1 turns around and faces the boys.] Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS."
234,12,1,Eric Cartman,All right!
235,12,1,Scientist 1,[throws open the lab doors and walks out] They found the cure for AIDS! [runs down the hall] The cure for AIDS!
236,12,1,Scientist 3,What is it?
237,12,1,Scientist 1,[grabs Scientist 3 by the shoulders] Large doses of concentrated cash! [runs down the hall] Get the media on the phone!
238,12,1,Scientist 4,[female] All right!
239,12,1,Anchorman,Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS. [smiles] About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.
240,12,1,Driver in Nigeria,Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
241,12,1,M C,"I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman. [the room applauds. Most everyone present is from South Park] Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds [Kyle's face gets angry], these two brave friends-"
242,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
243,12,1,M C,"These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys [Cartman grins. Kyle is still angry], here is... Jimmy Buffett!"
244,12,1,Eric Cartman,"[grin vanishing] What?! Aw, no!"
245,12,1,Jimmy Buffett,"Cureburger in paradise!
Cureburger. There I said it twice!"
246,12,1,Eric Cartman,"What?! Aw, God damn it! [puts his arm around Kyle] Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha."
247,12,1,Kyle Broflovski,I'm still breaking your Xbox. [turns right and walks off]
248,12,1,Eric Cartman,"What? No. No. [runs after him] Kyle, no!"
