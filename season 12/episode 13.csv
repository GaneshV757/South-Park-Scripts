9,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo."
10,12,13,Millie Larsen,Bridon Gueermo? Oh he's such a dream!
11,12,13,Red,"I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody."
12,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. [stands on the bench in place]

Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! [the girls begin to snap their fingers]"
13,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble."
14,12,13,Girls Table,"That's what bein' friends is about.
[Cue full instrumentation]
(Oh ye-ah)
[the girls stand on the benches and face the boys]
Everyone is special in their own way, and we'll always be together as one."
15,12,13,Eric Cartman,[puzzled] What the hell are they doing?
16,12,13,Girls Table,- Together as one -
17,12,13,Stan Marsh,I have no idea. [the other boys turn in their seats to get a better view]
18,12,13,Girls Table,"As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way."
19,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Dude, girls are such fags. [suddenly, Clyde, Craig, Jimmy, Token, and Jason leave the table and join the girls]"
20,12,13,Kids,"Oh yeah, oh yeah!"
21,12,13,Boys,[Dancing] Boys... are special in their own way.
22,12,13,Girls,[Dancing] Girls... are special like a birthday.
23,12,13,Kids,We'll always be dancin' and singin' aloud. Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh!
24,12,13,Heidi Turner,"Here he comes. [the boys make way for a new boy, Bridon Gueermo, who dances towards the camera]"
25,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"I like havin' fun in the hot summer sun (wooo!)
An' groovin' to the beat when my homework is all done. (yeah!)
If you ask me what I know, then you know what I will say?
That every single body is special in their own way."
26,12,13,Stan Marsh,[while the boy is singing] Who the hell is that?
27,12,13,Butters Stotch,"Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody."
28,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"[swooning, walks over to the boys] He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times."
29,12,13,Kids,Everyone is special in their own way
30,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Special in their own way!
31,12,13,Kids,Move to the beat and let your spirit out!
32,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Let it out! Party people!
33,12,13,Kids,"As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about."
34,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
35,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out..."
36,12,13,Singers,"You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!

That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-"
37,12,13,Eric Cartman,"This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. [silence follows for a few seconds, then Stan holds up the DVD case]"
38,12,13,Stan Marsh,Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
39,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
40,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm out guys. [get up from the sofa, puts on his jacket, and heads for the front door] If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends."
41,12,13,Stan Marsh,"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it."
42,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
43,12,13,Kenny McCormick,(No way in hell I'm doing it.)
44,12,13,Stan Marsh,"All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. [holds up his right hand. Kyle holds his right hand up as well, and Kenny holds up his left]"
45,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,I swear
46,12,13,Kenny McCormick,(I swear too.)
47,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Okay, good."
48,12,13,Eric Cartman,Ehhhhhhh. [Stan stops writing]
49,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
50,12,13,Eric Cartman,I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
51,12,13,Stan Marsh,But you didn't die?
52,12,13,Eric Cartman,"...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. [The bell rings and Mr. Garrison walks in with his books]"
53,12,13,Mr Garrison,"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats. [the last few kids take their seats] Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall. [He writes ""Berlin Wall"" on the chalkboard] This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side."
54,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"[stands up on the seat of her desk] East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. [some kids begin to snap their fingers]"
55,12,13,Bebe Stevens,As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
56,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,Aw man.
57,12,13,Class,Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat
58,12,13,Mr Garrison,"[beaming] Oh, you kids. [Stan buries his face in his hand]"
59,12,13,Class,"Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along."
60,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[enters the classroom]  East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free."
61,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. [Stan looks at them both and begins to worry that Bridon might sweep her away]
62,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along."
63,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along."
64,12,13,Class,"East siiide, west siiide, east siiide..."
65,12,13,Eric Cartman,[looking around and getting pissed off] God this sucks!
66,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?"
67,12,13,Stan Marsh,I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
68,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,"M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-"
69,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Stop. [holds his left hand out, palm out, for emphasis, and walks away. Jimmy stops singing]"
70,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,All righty then.
71,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Wendy] Uh, Wendy?"
72,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,[looks at him] Hey Stan.
73,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should."
74,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,What?
75,12,13,Stan Marsh,"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way."
76,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, that's ridiculous."
77,12,13,Stan Marsh,It is?
78,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,I would never leave you for Bridon.
79,12,13,Stan Marsh,[brightens up] Really?
80,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. [shuts her locker and walks away, kissing Stan on the left cheek. Jimmy arrives two second later]"
81,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,"There you go. Feel better, p-pal? [Stan stays quiet]"
82,12,13,Stan Marsh,"What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away. [at an intersection he takes a left turn] I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him. [kids appear behind him and follow him] But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse? [noticing the finger-snapping, he stops walking and looks around. The kids wait for him to start singing and dancing] No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!"
83,12,13,Kids,Awww. [murmurs follow]
84,12,13,Stan Marsh,"No, fuck off. I'm not doing it."
85,12,13,Kids,"Awww. [more murmuring. As they disperse, Butters walks up to Stan]"
86,12,13,Butters Stotch,"Awww jeez, you're no fun. [turns right and walks away. At the other end of the hall, Bridon rounds a corner and dances down the hallway in Stan's direction]"
87,12,13,Bebe Stevens,Hey Bridon.
88,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Hey.
89,12,13,Lola,Hi Bridon
90,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Hi.
91,12,13,Heidi Turner,Hey Bridon.
92,12,13,Millie Larsen,Hey Bridon.
93,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Hey.
94,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[now hiding behind a corner. Bridon passes by him unaware] Hey, kid, over here. [Bridon looks around and finds Stan, then walks over to him] Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit."
95,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Huh?
96,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed."
97,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,They are?
98,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me, [gets stern] you're driving everyone crazy."
99,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.
100,12,13,Stan Marsh,You don't like doing it?
101,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
102,12,13,Stan Marsh,Basketball?
103,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
104,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!"
105,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I can't.
106,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[firmly] Yes, you can. What's stopping you?"
107,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[sighs deeply] It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
108,12,13,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!"
109,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Really?
110,12,13,Stan Marsh,"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team."
111,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. [walks away]
112,12,13,Stan Marsh,[proud of himself] Sweet.
113,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"Sit up properly, Bridon. You know how strict your father is about posture. [serves out the casserole] All right dear, dinner's ready!"
114,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"[struts in, checks himself out in the mirror, and takes his seat at the head of the table] Okay, let's eat!"
115,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'."
116,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Ooo, that sounds emotional! [holds his hand against his ear to listen better] What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time."
117,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"No, Dad, can we just talk?"
118,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"If you can talk it, you can sing it. [gets up and dances to the mirror again] You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-"
119,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, I want to join the basketball team. [his Dad is upset. He turns around and faces Bridon]"
120,12,13,Mr Gueermo,What did you say?
121,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
122,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
123,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"But Dad, it's what I really want."
124,12,13,Mr Gueermo,There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
125,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I know. That's kind of why I like it.
126,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club."
127,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"It's my life, Dad!"
128,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Don't make me slap you! [raises his right hand up, ready to slap] I will slap your face so super hard... [Bridon quickly leaves the table and his dad sits back down] I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!"
129,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Maybe you should let him try it.
130,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"What did you say, woman?!"
131,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,You aren't being fair.
132,12,13,Mr Gueermo,That's it! I'm gonna slap you!
133,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"No, please."
134,12,13,Mr Gueermo,[begins to sing and slap] I slap you!
135,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Ahh!
136,12,13,Mr Gueermo,I slap you!
137,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Ohh!
138,12,13,Mr Gueermo,I slap slap slap you!
139,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Dohh!
140,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Slapping you slapping you silly 'cause you disrespected me.
141,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,Ooohohoo.
142,12,13,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class."
143,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd."
144,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Fuck you, Kyle! [upon entering the building, they are met by a pre-class musical production]"
145,12,13,Kids,"And you know, we're together at school again."
146,12,13,Jimmy Valmer,School again.
147,12,13,Stan Marsh,Aww!
148,12,13,Kids,"With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever."
149,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, shut up!"
150,12,13,Kids,Together at school again. What a special day.
151,12,13,Eric Cartman,Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
152,12,13,Kids,"We could say that neverrrrrrrrrrr
Goes away."
153,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!"
154,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom."
155,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself! [sees someone down the hall] Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett. [Mr. Garrett, the school coach, is eating an apple] This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good."
156,12,13,Mr Garrett,Really?
157,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[looks down and away] Look, I should be getting to class."
158,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department."
159,12,13,Stan Marsh,"You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate."
160,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I don't know...
161,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team."
162,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!"
163,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Okay.
164,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Aayy, that's great, Bridon."
165,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Thanks.
166,12,13,Jason White,We might have a chance at winning now. [the doors open at the far end of the gym and Mr. Gueermo enters]
167,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Bridon! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!
168,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, I was just messin' around."
169,12,13,Mr Gueermo,I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
170,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Eh, your kid is really good at this."
171,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! [Bridon puts his ams up in self-defense]"
172,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Just... go easy on him, huh?"
173,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"[gasps, then raises his right hand up to strike] You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!"
174,12,13,Mr Garrett,"If he wants to play ball, you should let him."
175,12,13,Mr Gueermo,I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!
176,12,13,Mr Garrett,He's just a kid.
177,12,13,Mr Gueermo,[slap] You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. [slap]
178,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, stop!"
179,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself [slaps with his left hand this time] There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you- [right-hand slap] Slap it, I'll slap it! [left-hand slap. He then pulls Bridon out of the gym.]"
180,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me."
181,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Shut up, Bridon! [as he reaches the doors, they open and Mr. Mackey appears]"
182,12,13,Mr Mackey,"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?"
183,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?! [Mackey doesn't reply, but he slaps him anyway] I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! [exits the gym, but returns to slap Mackey again, then leaves again]"
184,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?! [Stan watches them walk by, his plan dashed] You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!"
185,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,You're hurting my arm.
186,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Stupid-ass boy!
187,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[sighs deeply] Ah, shit."
188,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle. [Stan walks into the living room and stands to one side of the sofa] Yeah, nice."
189,12,13,Stan Marsh,"You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it."
190,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,What? Are you crazy?
191,12,13,Eric Cartman,No way dude.
192,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"We promised each other we would never do that, remember?"
193,12,13,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
194,12,13,Stan Marsh,"I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake."
195,12,13,Scott Malkinson,What's so bad about hanging out with me?
196,12,13,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."""
197,12,13,Scott Malkinson,"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!"
198,12,13,Eric Cartman,"""Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" [Kenny laughs]"
199,12,13,Stan Marsh,"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?"
200,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too."
201,12,13,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
202,12,13,Stan Marsh,"That isn't true! [no one challenges] Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids"
203,12,13,Scott Malkinson,"Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack."
204,12,13,Eric Cartman,"""That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."""
205,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. [the doorbell rings and Mr. Gueermo pauses the video and prances to the door. He opens it and two adults appear]
206,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),Mister... Gueermo?
207,12,13,Mr Gueermo,[barks] What?
208,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),[shows his official badge] We're from Child Protective Services. [puts it away] There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child?
209,12,13,Mr Gueermo,What? Who the hell's been saying that?!
210,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
211,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),His name is Stan Marsh.
212,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world o'hurt about to come your way!"
213,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),"Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son."
214,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"[performs a sweeping gesture to usher them in] Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! [the agents enter and walk over to Bridon]"
215,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),"Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly. [Mr. Gueermo sneaks up behind him, ready to slap him at any moment] We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's okay and just maybe... [Mr. Gueermo whistles, Mr. Kelly turns around, and Mr. Gueermo slaps him]"
216,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?! [slap] No, there's another one!"
217,12,13,Female CPS Agent and Male CPS Agent (Mr. Kelly),Oh my God!
218,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"[moves over to the female agent] Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you! [slaps her] There's a slap for you! [three slaps follow] Slap, slap, slap! [slaps Mr. Kelly three more times] Yeah, there you go! [slaps the female agent again] Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap! [slaps the female agent, then slaps Mr. Kelly. Mrs. Gueermo rushes in to intervene and take the slaps]"
219,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"Oh God, please, you have to get away! He won't ever stop! [he slaps her seven times]"
220,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Awww. I'm going slap-happy! [chases after the agents and slaps them several more times before they finally reach their car] I'm going slap, slap happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house! [the agents pull away quickly. He notices his next door neighbor looking on from his own doorway] What are you looking at, Robertson? [in a flash he slaps Robertson three times, and just as quickly he's back inside his house and closes the front door.]"
221,12,13,Bebe Stevens,They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! [the kids react and gather round the results sheet on the bulletin board. Butters is on a stool checking out the results for everyone]
222,12,13,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. [the girls congratulate her and Wendy says something in reply]"
223,12,13,Clyde Donovan,Who's the male lead?
224,12,13,Butters Stotch,"No surprise there. It's Bridon. [the boys and a few girls congratulate Bridon, who stays quiet] I get to be a stand-in! [moments later Wendy catches up to Bridon. Stan looks on from a distance]"
225,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,"Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together."
226,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[not enthused] Yeah, great."
227,12,13,Stan Marsh,"God damn it! [walks away. Next scene is him walking down the hall] No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop. [some kids look at him and decide to follow] And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? [he stops, the kids stop walking but continue snapping their fingers. Soon they smile in anticipation...]

Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
[the kids' anticipation fades. Stan isn't singing as they'd hope he would]
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
[Wendy, Bebe, and some other kids arrive]
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
[no one is making a sound. Stan puts his hands in his pockets, hangs his head, then turns left and walks away]"
228,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-"
229,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,[enters in a panic] Oh please. You have to do something.
230,12,13,Mr Gueermo,What are you interrupting me for?!
231,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"It's our son, he's- he's running away."
232,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"What?! [rushes downstairs and stops with flair behind Bridon, who's steps away from the front door] What's going on here, what's this all about? [brings his arms up and out, pointing to Bridon at the end with his left hand] What do you think you're doing?"
233,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-"
234,12,13,Mr Gueermo,Nono! Sing it!
235,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,[throws his duffle bag down] No! I'm sick of singing!
236,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Can you believe it? What'd he just say? What's the matter with kids these days? [fixes his gaze on his wife, who's terrified for a bit.]"
237,12,13,Mrs Gueermo,"[slowly, carefully] Kids these days."
238,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Kids these days! [Bridon ignores him and opens the door. His father flies through the air and slams the door shut with his body] Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!"
239,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,Just let me go.
240,12,13,Mr Gueermo,"Go ahead. Make my day. [gets down on his left knee and threatens] You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face! [Bridon punches him on the nose] Ow! [covers his nose and stands up] Oh my God, what was that? [runs to his wife] Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad! [she punches him harder] Ow. What the ""H"" is going on?! [she punches him again, and he runs off, crying. Bridon looks on in awe] What are you doing?! Everyone's crazy!"
241,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I had to see it to believe it!"
242,12,13,Eric Cartman,I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
243,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part."
244,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
245,12,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)"
246,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!"
247,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
248,12,13,Stan Marsh,Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
249,12,13,Scott Malkinson,"'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-"
250,12,13,Eric Cartman,"You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson."
251,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, guys. [gets off the sofa and walks away from the other boys] The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school. [turns around to face them] And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now, [points to them] everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you."
252,12,13,Eric Cartman,"That's a low blow, Stan."
253,12,13,Mr Mackey,"Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows."
254,12,13,Mr Garrett,"All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?"
255,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"[approaches wearing #11] I'm ready, coach."
256,12,13,Mr Garrett,"Give 'em hell! [Bridon goes in and faces off against the Bobcats' #9. He tosses the ball over to #7, Bradley, and then notices his parents on the bleachers. His mom waves hi, his dad looks away displeased.]"
257,12,13,Mr Mackey,"Just a minute to go in the first quarter. [Bridon gets the ball back and shots from the top of the key for a 3 pointer. Everyone applauds him, but his father still isn't looking at him. Mr. Gueermo does, however, notice the crowd's excitement and soon gets into it himself. The song changes to ""We Will Rock You"" and the crowd gets into that with two stomps and a clap. Mr. Gueermo joins right in]"
258,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?"
259,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
260,12,13,Wendy Testaburger,You gave it up?
261,12,13,Stan Marsh,"[walks into view with the other three boys] That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. [music begins to play]

'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. [walks up to a boy and girl]
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. [walks back to Bridon]
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball"
262,12,13,Eric Cartman,[approaches two other kids] But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
263,12,13,Stan Marsh,"Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
[the four boys form a chorus line and dance]"
264,12,13,Boys,"You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
[Kyle whips off his hat while approaching two girls]
True, girl, you know it's true, [returns to the chorus line] that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.
[Kyle dances away to two other girls]"
265,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. [Cartman dances over to two kids]"
266,12,13,Eric Cartman,"And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- [rejoins the chorus line with Kyle]"
267,12,13,Boys,"Do what you wanna do.
Just make sure that what you're doing is what's cool and popular with everyone
Chew, baby, chew and chew.
When you're eating jerky, if eating jerky is what you wanna do."
268,12,13,Bebe Stevens,"[arrives with Wendy, Red, and another girl during the song] Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?"
269,12,13,Bridon Gueermo,"Uhh, sure. [the girls follow him to the gym. The other students go their separate ways.]"
270,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Do what you want, don't have restraint."
271,12,13,Eric Cartman,Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
272,12,13,Kenny McCormick,"(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)"
273,12,13,Stan Marsh,Try to do what you wanna do!
274,12,13,Boys,"Do what you wanna do.
As long as what you wanna do is what everybody wants you to.
Glue, baby, buy some glue
Just in case if what you're doin' [Stan continues singing, they all keep dancing]"
275,12,13,Stan Marsh,involves needing scissors and glue!
276,12,13,Scott Malkinson,Hey guys. Hey guys! [all stop. Stan looks around and doesn't see anyone else]
277,12,13,Stan Marsh,Huh? [the other boys turn around]
278,12,13,Kyle Broflovski,Where did everybody go?
279,12,13,Scott Malkinson,The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
280,12,13,Stan Marsh,But the girls like singing and dancing.
281,12,13,Scott Malkinson,"No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does."
282,12,13,Stan Marsh,"But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!."
