[closes the book and goes back to normal voice] Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay."
7,12,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs."

9,12,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what?"
10,12,14,Butters Stotch,There's vampires in the school!
11,12,14,Stan Marsh,What?
12,12,14,Butters Stotch,Vampires. I've seen 'em.
13,12,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!"
14,12,14,Red,Not a cheat if you rank up.
15,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Ugh. [goes over to Kenny] Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. Then Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!"
16,12,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, there's no such thing as vampires."
17,12,14,Butters Stotch,"[goes over to Kyle] But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything."
18,12,14,Eric Cartman,"All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are."
19,12,14,Butters Stotch,Really? Do you think that's best?
20,12,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, now get out of here."
21,12,14,Butters Stotch,"All right! [runs to the entrance, then turns around] If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. [turns back and runs out]"

Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?! [Butters begins to tap his fists together, nervously] Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!"
72,12,14,Butters Stotch,"I have no idea, sir."
73,12,14,Stephen Stotch,I'll tell you why! [walks over to the pantry and opens the door] Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!
74,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-it's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were-"
75,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"What keeps a family together, Butters?!"
76,12,14,Butters Stotch,A well-organized pantry.
77,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"That's right! [starts throwing food out of the pantry on to the floor] If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong! [stops] Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!"
78,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-"
79,12,14,Stephen Stotch,You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
80,12,14,Butters Stotch,[hangs his head] Yes sir. [Stephen walks away. Butters turns to the task at hand and begins putting stuff away] Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want.

107,12,14,Vampir,"[walks into view] You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?"

110,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school."
111,12,14,Vampir,"Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin! [they all walk away, leaving behind the Dr. Pepper and Twizzlers. They walk to South Park Mall] This way. Prepare thyself. [the mall is still open, so they walk over to Hot Topic and enter. The Vamps begin checking out clothes for Butters to wear as a new Vamp. The Midnight Vamp gets some fake teeth with fangs while the Cowlick Vamp gets some necklaces and rings. They outfit Butters with them. The Sparkly Vamp gets some hairspray and she and the Spiky Vamp spray Butters' hair with it. Bloodrayne measures him for collars and bracelets. Finally, all six Vamps step away, and a new Vamp is born]"
112,12,14,Butters Stotch,Whoa.
113,12,14,Vampir,"And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se! [walks away and pours out a bottle of Clamato juice into a goblet for Butters to drink] With this, thy transformation is done. [Butters takes a sip, then immediately spits it out]"

138,12,14,Pete,Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. [they all look at each other thoughtfully]
139,12,14,Pete,"Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. [the soccer ball bounces towards the Goth kids again and stops in front of Henrietta]"

He wiggles his fingers, then relaxes them and grips Cartman's head and back] Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. [rears back and bites into Cartman's neck, making sucking sounds. Cartman wakes up and looks at him]"
146,12,14,Eric Cartman,Butters? [Butters continues] Butters?! [Butters backs up and then hops off the bed]

169,12,14,Michael,What should we do with him?
170,12,14,Pete,"Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart."

172,12,14,Michael,[leans in and puts his hand to his left ear] What's that?
173,12,14,Vampir,(I'm not really a vampire.)
174,12,14,Michael,You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. [moves off and joins the other Goths]
175,12,14,Pete,"If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way."
176,12,14,Michael,How about we send him to Transylvania?

On the headboard are four lit candles. He's hyperventilating] Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!"
182,12,14,Butters Stotch,What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
183,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door! [counts up with his fingers] One! Two! [the door is unlocked and opened a little.

185,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!"
186,12,14,Butters Stotch,I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
187,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"[angrily] All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!"
188,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Dahhh. [hops down from the bookcase and tries to hop onto his toy box, but he trips and lands on the floor. He gets up, climbs onto the toy box and crouches on the window sill, and hisses at them] I know now what I have to do! [hops down to the ground outside] Myah!"
189,12,14,Linda Stotch,"[walks over to the open window] Stephen, what has happened to our boy?"
190,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"[joins her there] He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground."
191,12,14,Michael,"I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires."
192,12,14,"The Goth kids
 Pete
 Michael
 Henrietta Biggle
 Firkle",He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
193,12,14,Waitress,Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again? [pours them another round]
194,12,14,"The Goth kids
 Pete
 Michael
 Henrietta Biggle
 Firkle",Leave us alone!
195,12,14,Waitress,"Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section. [she points to them with her left thumb; there are two booths bursting with Vamps. One has seven Vamps, the other has nine]"
196,12,14,Pete,They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
197,12,14,Waitress,Looks the same to me.
198,12,14,Pete,I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.
199,12,14,Waitress,"[turns to face the Vamps] No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice. [turns left and walks away. Pete drops his head on the table and keeps it there]"
200,12,14,"The Goth kids
 Pete
 Michael
 Henrietta Biggle
 Firkle",Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village Inn from us too.
201,12,14,Pete,"Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. Freakin' vampires beat us."
202,12,14,Butters Stotch,Maybe not. [hisses. He's on all fours on the ledge behind the booths] Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires? [crawls closer to the Goths] I want to help you.
203,12,14,"The Goth kids
 Pete
 Michael
 Henrietta Biggle
 Firkle","Get away, douchebag."
204,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again."
205,12,14,Pete,What are you talking about?
206,12,14,Butters Stotch,I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. [the Goths look at each other]
207,12,14,Pete,"Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?"
208,12,14,Butters Stotch,Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
209,12,14,Michael,Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.
210,12,14,Pete,How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
211,12,14,"The Goth kids
 Pete
 Michael
 Henrietta Biggle
 Firkle","Well, I think we all know what has to be done."
212,12,14,Michael,Yup.
213,12,14,Pete,"Let's get to it. [they turn and head into the store. They get aerosol cans and fan out across the store, start spraying, and light the sprays with their lighters, turning the cans into makeshift flamethrowers]"
214,12,14,Singer,"Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it take your soul.
Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
And take control.
Burn down... Hot Topic.
Burn it down... Hot Topic."
215,12,14,Hot Topic Clerk,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
216,12,14,Pete,"You should probably get out of here. [Firkle torches some clothes. Henrietta torches the fake teeth and products with fangs on them. Michael torches the sign announcing 25% off body jewelry and fashion belts. Outside, Bloodrayne and the Spiky Vamp arrive in shock]"
217,12,14,Spiky Vamp,What the hell are they doing??
218,12,14,Butters Stotch,They're putting an end to it! [the clerk runs out of the store]
219,12,14,Hot Topic Clerk,"AAAAAAAAAAAAH! [the Goths continue torching the store until it's thoroughly engulfed in flames, then they walk out and leave. The Hot Topic sign above the entrance crashes to the floor.]"
220,12,14,Butters Stotch,"[enters the living room happily] Mom, Dad! [closes the front door, runs to the sofa, and stands on the sofa between them.] I changed back!"
221,12,14,Stephen Stotch,What?
222,12,14,Butters Stotch,"Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!"
223,12,14,Linda Stotch,"We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home."
224,12,14,Stephen Stotch,That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.
225,12,14,Butters Stotch,"What's that, Dad?"
226,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!"
227,12,14,Butters Stotch,Uh oh.
228,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, you are-"
229,12,14,Butters Stotch,I Know! I Know! I am Grounded! [walks up the stairs to his room.]
230,12,14,Stephen Stotch,"It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. [they hug each other]"
231,12,14,Pete,"[at the mic] Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's ""fun"", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. [everyone begins to applaud the speech. During the applause, Michael steps up to the mic and gives everyone the finger]"
232,12,14,Michael,Fuck all of you.
