0,12,4,Mr Mackey,"Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day."
1,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, I'm bored already."
2,12,4,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? [exits right as the tape starts up. A Canadian flag appears onscreen]"
3,12,4,WCB President,"[appears in his office onscreen] Hello, I am Stephen Abootman, President of the World Canadian Bureau. Do you ever stop to think how important Canada is to the world? Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up. [no one moves a muscle until one lone Canadian boy, Ike, stands up.] Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?"
4,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Gayness! [everyone laughs and looks at Ike, who looks chagrined.]"
5,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important?
6,12,4,Craig Tucker,Nothing! [everyone laughs harder and looks at Ike.]
7,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"My fellow Canadians, for too long we have been pushed around, and ridiculed! Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding! Instead, Canada Appreciation Day was mocked worldwide! [the crowd begins to clamor]"
8,12,4,Man 1,[wearing #10] Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!
9,12,4,Lumberjack 2,"It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?"
10,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!
11,12,4,Canadian Woman 1,Did you say strike?
12,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!
13,12,4,Man 2,"Canada, on strike."
14,12,4,Man 3,"Canada, on strike."
15,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"[a different crowd shot for each ""Canadaaa""]
Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Caaanaaadaaa!
Canada on strike! Canada says ""No more!""
No more neglect! We want respect! That's what we're striking for!
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats"
16,12,4,Border Guard,Can all just take a hike! [rolls down his window shade]
17,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"[large crowd] It's Canaada! On Strike!
[they whip out their strike signs]
Canada on strike! From Vancouver to St. John's [both locations are shown],
We raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon!
[a hockey team] And with our fingers up your ass,
[workers at The Canadian Maple Syrup Company] you won't be very psyched
[workers in the building drop syrup barrels from the upper floors] It's Canada! On Strike!
[Mounties march in a circle] And we will not bow a bunch! Our resolve is strong!
[A conductor leads a group of singers] We even took three hours to rehearse this striking song! [a trumpeter leans in and toots.]
[Pizza Nut] Canada on strike! No matter where you are,
[On TV at Café 180] If you are Canadian then you've got to do your part!
March out of the halls!"
18,12,4,Caf 18 Patron,"[stands up and poses] That's right, suck my Canadian balls!
[runs out and poses] It's Canada! On Strike!"
19,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"[the camera zooms out to a view from space of a nation of singing Canadians]
It's Canada! Canada! Canada! On Strike!
[a lone Canadian laughs somewhere]"
20,12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Ahhh, when you say ""Canada is on strike"", what exactly do you mean?"
21,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"What do you think it means?! [pounds the table] We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want"
22,12,4,French Delegate,Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?
23,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!
24,12,4,French Delegate,The WGA?
25,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[crosses his arms] Yes! The World Canadian Bureau! [the other delegates don't react.]
26,12,4,French Delegate,What exactly does Canada want?
27,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,We want: more... money!
28,12,4,Aide 1,[with mustache] Yeah! More money!
29,12,4,Japanese Delegate,More money from where?
30,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!"
31,12,4,Aide 1,Yeah! Give us Internet money!
32,12,4,British Delegate,"A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that-"
33,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Don't give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling! Are you gonna give Canada more money or not?! [pounds his fist on the table a few times]
34,12,4,British Delegate,I'm afraid we can't.
35,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Then you leave Canada no choice. [heads for the doors. His aides open them and he heads out] This strike shall continue! [the aides head out, closing the doors behind them.]"
36,12,4,Husband and Wife,"""Honk if you support Canada"" He- hey honey, watch this. [honks twice]"
37,12,4,Husband and Wife,"[looks at him] Oh, we're supporting unions."
38,12,4,Husband and Wife,That's right; we're a very progressive couple.
39,12,4,Husband and Wife,"Yes. [reaches over and honks the horn] Oh, that's fun!"
40,12,4,Husband and Wife,Well we've done our good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry.
41,12,4,Husband and Wife,Oh really? Goodie! [they drive off. Ike watches them leave]
42,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, I'm really worried about my brother."
43,12,4,Eric Cartman,We don't care. *urp*
44,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!"
45,12,4,Stan Marsh,"Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!"
46,12,4,Butters Stotch,Yippie!
47,12,4,Announcer,It's the Terrance and Phillip Show. [Terrance and Phillip in] Today's episode: I Fart Huckabees. [Terrance and Phillip are shown dressed in Viking warrior outfits]
48,12,4,Butters Stotch,"Aww, this one again?!"
49,12,4,Stan Marsh,"God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!"
50,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car."
51,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,Oh? Does it run on electricity?
52,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"[the boys say the line too] No, it uses natural gas. [they do raspberries as Terrance farts on Phillip. Terrance and Phillip laugh]"
53,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,Not as fat as your face!
54,12,4,Butters Stotch,"Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings."
55,12,4,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!"
56,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
57,12,4,Stan Marsh,"It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. [""Terrance and Phillip"" disappears and ""Family Guy"" comes on]"
58,12,4,Peter Griffin,"You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang ""La Cucaracha"" for Paul McCartney?"
59,12,4,Eric Cartman,[jumps off the couch and runs to the TV] No! NOOO!
60,12,4,Peter Griffin,La Cucaracha- [Cartman turns off the TV and faces his friends] We are NOT... resorting to that!
61,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,We want more! We want more!
62,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! [Terrance and Phillip walk up to him]"
63,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit."
64,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Go home?! You can't leave the picket line!
65,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic."
66,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!"
67,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Don't call me a rat, buddih!"
68,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"I'm not your buddih, friend!"
69,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"He's not your friend, guy!"
70,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"I'm not your guy, buddih!"
71,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"He's not your buddih, friend!"
72,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"I'm not your friend, guy! [all three fall silent, and Stephen goes forward] Don't you two understand anything?! You think striking is a joke?! You think it's something to ridicule?!"
73,12,4,Weird Hat Guy,"[pops in] Yah, you think this is funnih?"
74,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[moves to address the whole crowd] Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we have nothing?!
75,12,4,Aide 1,[runs up with a cell phone] Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike!
76,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later! [the crowd gets excited and starts chatting] Shh, shh, quiet everyone! Let me handle this. [everyone falls silent as he takes the call] Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA."
77,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. [he's calling from his house, with the other boys standing back aways]"
78,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Oh you do, huh?! [muffles the phone, then tells the others] They've had enough. They want us to end the strike. [everyone cheers] Quiet, quiet, shh, shh, sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this. [the Canadians fall silent and Stephen returns to the phone] All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh!"
79,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,We totally think you should have more money.
80,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Wwe got 'em! We did it! [jumps up and down with much energy. Everyone cheers. ""Great job!""] All right, how much are you gonna give us?"
81,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
82,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!"
83,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,The Internet?
84,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"You listen to me, friend! [walks away from the crowd so they don't hear him so loudly] You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead! [hangs up, then faces the crowd] Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls."
85,12,4,Stan Marsh,What'd they say?
86,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
87,12,4,Eric Cartman,How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
88,12,4,Butters Stotch,"Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?"
89,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
90,12,4,Eric Cartman,[steps up] Wait. I've got it.
91,12,4,Butters Stotch,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt [the teddy bear outfit returns]
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? [Stan gives a thumbs-up. Cartman does the same. The video is on YouToob]
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

[from behind a big chocolate heart] It's okay
[Butters floating in space] Ih-if you have a little fight
[a girl watches the video] Don't you worry
[Butters bites into the heart] I won't bite (Not that hard)
[Spaceman Butters] If you want it
[a man watches the video] I'll give you power
Just be gentle
[Flower Butters] I'm delicate like a flower

Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please"
92,12,4,A Nun,Oh my.
93,12,4,Butters Stotch,"[now in three voices] I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
[wearing black jeans with ""what what"" on the butt] I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
[a naked Butters holds a rose] You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!"
94,12,4,Eric Cartman,There's more people viewing it!
95,12,4,Stan Marsh,This is going great!
96,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks over to the window] Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! [Ike is on his back]"
97,12,4,Tom the Anchorman,"And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending."
98,12,4,Aide 1,How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!
99,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories."
100,12,4,Tom the Anchorman,"In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called ""What What (In My Asshole)""."
101,12,4,Female Reporter,"[in front of Butters' house] Tom, in just one week the video has become the most watched thing in all of America. [Butters appears at his bedroom window and waves at the camera] The boy in the video, referred to by most as ""that little gay kid"", [Butters stops and leaves the window] has already been asked to appear on Jimmy Kimmel and The Today Show."
102,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?!
103,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?"
104,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!
105,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation."
106,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Yeah, let's give it up, guy."
107,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!"
108,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Well I'm not your friend, buddih!"
109,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Well I'm not your buddih, guy!"
110,12,4,Canadian Woman 2,Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!
111,12,4,Tom the Anchorman,"And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money. [the Canadians cheer]"
112,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen."
113,12,4,Tom the Anchorman,"In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians."
114,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,What?
115,12,4,Female Reporter,Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?
116,12,4,Danish Man,"Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us."
117,12,4,Danish Woman,Nobody knows where Denmark is.
118,12,4,Danish Man,"Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe."
119,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,SCABS! How could you?! [runs up to the TV annd destroys it with one kick]
120,12,4,Stan Marsh,"Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money."
121,12,4,Clerk,Take a number and wait with everyone else.
122,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob."
123,12,4,Clerk,[not taking time out from her work] Take a number and wait with everyone else! [Stan takes a numbered slip from the dispenser and leads the other boys to some seats in a waiting room nearby]
124,12,4,Black Man,"[slowly, a little creepily] Chocolate Raaain."
125,12,4,Butters Stotch,Aaah. [another man walks up to the boys]
126,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"Hey, I know you. You're the ""What What (In My Asshole)"" kid."
127,12,4,Butters Stotch,"[insulted, crosses his arms] ""What What (In The Butt),"" sir."
128,12,4,Stan Marsh,It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
129,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa. [to his right is the Numa Numa guy. He begins dancing to a song]"
130,12,4,Numa Numa,"Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha"
131,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"And the Star Wars kid. [the kid starts to dance around as in his video] And the Internet sensation Cute Sneezing Panda. [as in its video, the mother panda sneezes as soon as her child moves] And there's Dramatic Look Gopher. [the camera pans by a lonely girl and focuses on the gopher, who seems to notice the camera is on him. He quickly turns to face the camera and freezes]"
132,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!"
133,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"[to Butters] So, how many people have seen your Internet video?"
134,12,4,Butters Stotch,Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
135,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire."
136,12,4,Eric Cartman,"Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year."
137,12,4,Chris Crocker,[jumps in out of nowhere] Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone! Leave him alohohone! I'm serious! [a phone rings and Kyle digs into his pocket]
138,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,[finds the phone...] Excuse me. [...leaves his seat and exits the waiting room. Then he takes the call] Hello?
139,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[sitting on a cardboard box] You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.
140,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Wait we're working on it.
141,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[stands and moves forward] You're stalling! Because you think I'll give up. You know that most Canadians are talkin' about giving up the strike already. [coughs away from the phone] You've got me over a barrel and you know it!
142,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Sir, we're doing everything we can."
143,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood! [Kyle stays quiet] Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will never call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die."
144,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,We don't want you to die.
145,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. [slowly hangs up]
146,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We have to speed this up! [to Chocolate Rain Guy] Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?"
147,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.
148,12,4,Star Wars Kid,"Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!"
149,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.
150,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,"Oh please, Laughing Baby had four times as many views as you! [the baby begins to laugh and laugh...]"
151,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby!"
152,12,4,Afro Ninja,Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.
153,12,4,Star Wars Kid,Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions!
154,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,You all wanna motherfuckin' die?! [whips out a Glock and cocks it]
155,12,4,Chris Crocker,NOOO! [grabs the gun and tries to wrestle it from Chocolate Rain Guy]
156,12,4,Numa Numa Guy,Haw!
157,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn."
158,12,4,Tron Guy Canadians,Hai Hayaaa!
159,12,4,Numa Numa,"Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyah- [kicks Tron Guy in the balls, then lands a left hook on his face]"
160,12,4,Chris Crocker,[jumps in to separate the two men] Leave Tron Guy alone! Leave him alone! [the baby continues laughing. Chocolate Rain Guy grabs Chris Crocker by the hair and drags him around. Chris is screaming]
161,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Get ready for some chocolate pain, bitch! [aims his right at Chris' head. Chris quickly bites Chocolate Rain Guy's right leg, making him drop the gun. The mother panda mauls Numa Numa, Tron Guy throws his frisbee again, and Chris Crocker jumps in again]"
162,12,4,Chris Crocker,"Leave the panda alone! Leave her alone, I'm serious! [the mother panda stands on her hind legs and just swats Chris out of view, killing him. Chocolate Rain Guy reaches for his fallen gun, turns around, and kills Star Wars Kid with two shots. The mother panda mauls Tron Guy to death, and Chocolate Rain Guy kills the panda with four shots. He then aims at the gopher]"
163,12,4,Chocolate Rain Guy,"Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?! [the gopher, who's facing away from him, suddenly turns its head to him, looking at him intently] Ughhh, my brains. [his head swells up and explodes. His body staggers for a few seconds, then falls to the side. One last bullet leaves his gun and blows the gopher's head off. Anyone who was involved in the battle is gone]"
164,12,4,Eric Cartman,Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
165,12,4,Aide 1,"[opens the office door] Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate!"
166,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,[turns around] What?! You mean it?! [Kyle and friends walk in]
167,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, we did it."
168,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Who the hell are you?
169,12,4,Stan Marsh,We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
170,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Here. [hands Mr. Abootman the money] We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. [Mr. Abootman takes the check and looks at it]
171,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?! [turns away] You little timewasters!
172,12,4,Stan Marsh,"Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!"
173,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
174,12,4,Eric Cartman,"...You are a homo, Butters."
175,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!"
176,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it! [the phone rings and he turns to answer it] Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau."
177,12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike."
178,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!
179,12,4,French Delegate,"No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park. [Mr. Abootman drops the phone and begins to weep. He walks away with his hands over his eyes]"
180,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[picks up the phone] Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!"
181,12,4,Swiss Delegate,Excuse me?
182,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Mr. Abootman leans on the door, crying] He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!"
183,12,4,French Delegate,"Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize"
184,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"If they give you something small, will you end the strike?"
185,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?
186,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
187,12,4,Swiss Delegate,"Sure, why not?"
188,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,We have won! [no one reacts: they're all too tired to]
189,12,4,Lumberjack 2,Well how much did we get?
190,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these... [holds up some coupons] coupons to Bennigan's! And... [holds up a bag of sweets] free bubblegum... for every Canadian. [his aide steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands] These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course."
191,12,4,Aide 1,We did it! [aide 2 steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands]
192,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. [headlines follow: The Canuck Reporter has ""Canada Wins The Strike"". Canadiety has ""Strike over! Canada Victorious!"". Canada Today has ""Strike Victory Party Set For Next Week"".]"
193,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Ike. Ike! [Ike wakes up] It's over.
194,12,4,Ike Broflovski,[stands up] It's over?
195,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Here you go. [hands him a Bennigan's coupon and a gumdrop. Kyle and the others head indoors]
196,12,4,Stan Marsh,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with."
197,12,4,Butters Stotch,Me too!
198,12,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media."
199,12,4,Stan Marsh,...Yeah.
200,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo! [the reason for everyone standing around is shown: a memorial wall on one side of the room has pictures of everyone who died during the strike. Mourners walk up with bouquets and drop them off at the table in front of the wall.]"
201,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"Hold on a minute! Wait just a second! [the music stops as Terrance holds out a calculator] We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!"
202,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
203,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance."
204,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
205,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect. [Terrance and Phillip don't believe what they're hearing]"
206,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!
207,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"We're setting you adrift, idiot!"
208,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
209,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"You'll regret this day, friend!"
210,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"I'm not your friend, buddih!"
211,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"I'm not your buddih, guy!"
212,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"He's not your guy, friend!"
213,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"[loud and drawn out] I'm not your friend, buddih!"
214,12,4,Terrance & Phillip,"We're not your buddih, guy!"
215,12,4,Stephen Abootman and his aides,"[now far away] I'm not your guy, friend!"
