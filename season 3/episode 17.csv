0,3,17,Announcer,"This Saturday, Pox presents the musical event of the new millennium! You all remember playing the recorder in elementary school! [a recorder resting on a book of sheet music is shown] Well, this Saturday in Oklahoma City [its skyline is shown], over 4 million third-grade students [a crowd of them is shown] from all over the country [a school bus full of students is shown] will gather in one place, and at the same time, play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. [a girl is shown playing a white one] It's the largest third-grade recorder concert ever! [An elderly man instructs three students, one of them in a wheelchair] Special guest conductor Yoko Ono [pictured] and woodwind virtuoso Kenny G [pictured] will lead this fantastic event! This Saturday, at 11 Eastern / 10 Central. The world will be watching! [close-up of a small boy playing his recorder]"
1,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma."
2,3,17,Class,[groaning] Awww.
3,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?! [raises his baton] Recorders up. [the students set their recorders between their lips] And a-1 and a-2 and a- [the class begins to play the song. Some students play slow] ""...of liberty."" You're late! [the kids play faster, but are still off] ""...my father-"" What the hell was that?! [the students lower their recorders] God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!"
4,3,17,Eric Cartman,"That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long."
5,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[Kenny laughs] Shut up, fatass!"
6,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. [Kenny laughs so hard he falls off his seat]"
7,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up. [the students set their recorders between their lips] And a-1 and a-2 and a- [the class begins to play the song. Mr. Garrison genuflects and bangs his head against his desk. Mr. Mackey walks in, looking at this behavior]"
8,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, that sounded great, kids. [Mr. Garrison looks up at him]"
9,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[rising] Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken."
10,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas."
11,3,17,Mr Garrison,[close-up. He's suddenly scared] Arkansas?
12,3,17,Stan Marsh,What's Arkansas—is that a state?
13,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? [hands them out. Craig reads his sheet.]"
14,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?"
15,3,17,Mr Mackey,M'kay. [joins Mr. Garrison aside]
16,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me."
17,3,17,Mr Mackey,What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
18,3,17,Mr Garrison,[wistfully] Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my [stifles a sob] ...father still lives there.
19,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Well, don't you want to see them?"
20,3,17,Mr Garrison,I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
21,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay? [walks him over to a chair and sits him down] Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?"
22,3,17,Mr Garrison,"...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me."
23,3,17,Mr Mackey,When was that?
24,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—"
25,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy? [Mr. Garrison begins to cry] Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?"
26,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[turns away] Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! [hurries out of the classroom crying]"
27,3,17,Eric Cartman,That was pretty cool.
28,3,17,Mr Mackey,M'kay.
29,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[with recorder] Okay, how about this one, Kenny? [plays an A note]"
30,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(Uh-uh.)
31,3,17,Eric Cartman,No? How about this? [plays a G note]
32,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(Nope.)
33,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? [plays a Gb note. Kyle and Stan turn around on their seat]"
34,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
35,3,17,Eric Cartman,"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control."
36,3,17,Stan Marsh,"What's ""lose bowel control?"""
37,3,17,Eric Cartman,That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
38,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!"
39,3,17,Eric Cartman,Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
40,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Nuh-uh!
41,3,17,Eric Cartman,"How about this one, Kenny? [plays an F note]"
42,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh-uh.)
43,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"There is no brown noise, fat boy!"
44,3,17,Eric Cartman,That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
45,3,17,Stan Marsh,Who's Karen Carpenter?
46,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Aaaaaah! [apparently, he's seen a sign that reads: ""Arkansas 410 miles. Rest Stop 5 miles""] Huhh, ohh, [the students and Mr. Mackey look back.]"
47,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Mr. Garrison, are you alright?"
48,3,17,Mr Hat,Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.
49,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?"
50,3,17,Mr Hat,"Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!"
51,3,17,Mr Mackey,M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
52,3,17,Mr Hat,"No! No, you moron! [Mr. Mackey gets annoyed] Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!"
53,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!"
54,3,17,Mr Hat,Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
55,3,17,Mr Mackey,What did you say?!
56,3,17,Mr Hat,"You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!"
57,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Why, you son of a bitch! [rips Mr. Hat from Mr. Garrison's hand and starts beating him up. Mr. Hat smacks Mr. Mackey down in front of Terrence, who looks aghast]"
58,3,17,Stan Marsh,Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. [the other students turn to see the fight]
59,3,17,Mr Mackey,"I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?! [resumes fighting Mr. Hat]"
60,3,17,Students,[cheering] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
61,3,17,Ms Crabtree,BE QUIET BACK THERE!
62,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Yuh-NO! [panting, dirty and black-eyed, gets up and places Mr. Hat between Mr. Garrison's arms] You may have won this time, Mr. Hat."
63,3,17,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!"
64,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"[a female with clipboard, walking up] School?"
65,3,17,Mr Mackey,Excuse me?
66,3,17,Concert Coordinator,What school are you from?
67,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?"
68,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York. [distracted by something away from the bus] Nono, don't put the Florida kids in the building! [moves away. The class walks past the New York children]"
69,3,17,Tough Guy 1,[sitting on the bus's front right fender] Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
70,3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, huh? [they begin to snicker as the South Park kids look back]"
71,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Whoa, look at this kid's coat. [Kenny's] Ey, kid. What's the matter—you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What? [the others laugh]"
72,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[aside, to Stan] Who the hell are these guys?"
73,3,17,Tough Guy 1,I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
74,3,17,Stan Marsh,We're not rednecks!
75,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!"
76,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?! [the other New Yorkers laugh]"
77,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[aside, to Stan, softly] Stan, what's a queef?"
78,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny?
79,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(I don't know!)
80,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!"
81,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!"
82,3,17,Black kid,"[wearing EKKO shirt] Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?!"
83,3,17,Eric Cartman,Aaaa-
84,3,17,Stan Marsh,Why?! Don't you know?!
85,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
86,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, dickhole! [feedback is heard, and all look to the source]"
87,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"[on bullhorn] I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in."
88,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"[as South Park leaves] Yeah see ya later, queefs! [at least Stan and Kyle are pissed off. They look angry as they look at each other]"
89,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! [drops his book]"
90,3,17,Stan Marsh,[reading another book] Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
91,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, let's try the dictionary. [picks it up] queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef."
92,3,17,Stan Marsh,Damnit! [closes his book]
93,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[reading another book, jumps for joy] Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!"
94,3,17,Stan Marsh,You did? [the other three gather around]
95,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
96,3,17,Eric Cartman,"I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise."""
97,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Awwgh!
98,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Damnit Cartman, wha-?!"
99,3,17,Eric Cartman,"""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?"
100,3,17,Stan Marsh,Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! [he and the other two return to their books and read on]
101,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[on the walkway, sighs] I can do this. I have to do this. [approaches the door and rings the bell. His father answers] Hello. Dad."
102,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Oh, hello, son."
103,3,17,Mr Garrison,Can I ...come in?
104,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Ub. Sure, of course. [Mr. Garrison enters] Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?"
105,3,17,Mr Garrison,"No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did."
106,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, what?"
107,3,17,Mr Garrison,"I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things."
108,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, okay, like what?"
109,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it! [sighs] I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!"
110,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,What??
111,3,17,Mr Garrison,I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this!
112,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
113,3,17,Mr Garrison,I know! I wanna know why not?!
114,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,WHAT??
115,3,17,Mr Garrison,Was it that I was ugly?!
116,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Oh, my God! [turns around]"
117,3,17,Mr Garrison,"I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!"
118,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, NO!! [walks away, but his son rushes up to grab him]"
119,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! [runs off crying. Mr. Garrison Sr. can only express shock.]"
120,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"[Onstage] Alright, everyone, quiet please! There are over 4 million of you, so we must have quiet! At this time I would like to introduce the woman who is making this all possible, Yoko Ono! [motions for Yoko to enter]"
121,3,17,Yoko Ono,"Please [orates 20 seconds of incomprehensible, imitation, Japanese-accented English]... sing song ""My Country 'Tis of Thee."""
122,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes."
123,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means."
124,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means."
125,3,17,Stan Marsh,"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em."
126,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
127,3,17,Stan Marsh,What word could we make up?
128,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,How about... finkleroy?
129,3,17,Stan Marsh,"No, uhno, not finkleroy."
130,3,17,Eric Cartman,"How about geebo, or, or mung?"
131,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, mung."
132,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Mung's good.
133,3,17,Stan Marsh,Sh. Here they come. [the New Yorkers arrive]
134,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?"
135,3,17,Stan Marsh,You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
136,3,17,Tough Guy 2,We're not mung. You're mung.
137,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?"
138,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Of course we know what mung means!
139,3,17,Athlete,"Yeah, D'ya think we wouldn't know what mung means? [Stan laughs, then Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny join in]"
140,3,17,Stan Marsh,We busted you!
141,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! [they resume laughing]
142,3,17,Tough Guy 1,You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
143,3,17,Stan Marsh,[the boys stop laughing] It is?
144,3,17,New Yorkers,[behind the two toughs and two others] Yeah. [they turn around]
145,3,17,Athlete,It sure is.
146,3,17,New Yorker 1,Yeah.
147,3,17,New Yorker 2,Uh huh. [turns around]
148,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
149,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,[winces] Eewww.
150,3,17,Stan Marsh,Ooogh.
151,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"You guys didn't know that? [the rest of the New Yorkers turn around and they all laugh. Then, the rest of the 4 million+ kids laugh with them] Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'! [they leave. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny turn on Cartman]"
152,3,17,Stan Marsh,"You dumbass, Cartman!"
153,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!"
154,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow."
155,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about."
156,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,About what?
157,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[set his cup down and sighs] Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?"
158,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,That... that can't be.
159,3,17,Mr Garrison,"He never did, Mom, not once."
160,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,[stands] That's not true! Your father loved you! Often!
161,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[stands] He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!"
162,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"[cups her ears and shuts her eyes, spilling her coffee] Nohoho! No! If I knew I would have made him do it!"
163,3,17,Mr Garrison,You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
164,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,I'm not listening!
165,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Face it, Mother. He never abused me! [his mom starts to cry, and his dad enters the room carrying groceries]"
166,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, what's goin' on?"
167,3,17,Mr Garrison,Mother won't hear the truth!
168,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,He says you didn't molest him as a child!
169,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
170,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,No! I didn't know! [cups her ears and shuts her eyes again] I'm not listening!
171,3,17,Mr Garrison,"You can't close your eyes forever, Mother! [she walks away, crying] Mother, wait! [runs after her. Again, Mr. Garrison Sr. is shocked]"
172,3,17,Yoko Ono,"[Speaks in imitation, harshly thick, Japanese-accented English] Alright people, how many people has a copy. We must have-a practiced the ... song for the performance tomorrow, please."
173,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here."
174,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise."
175,3,17,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
176,3,17,Yoko Ono,"And-a one gop seven to-sand ... [the children begin to play, and she covers her ears in agony] O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?!"
177,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is that lady talking about?
178,3,17,Stan Marsh,I have no idea.
179,3,17,Mr Mackey,"[bends down and looks in] Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.?"
180,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Thuh, that's me."
181,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay."
182,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,[slides out and rises] What can I do for ya?
183,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay."
184,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!"
185,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Eh, you didn't?"
186,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
187,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different."
188,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him."
189,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about ""sexual molestation"", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality."
190,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,I didn't do it because it's wrong!
191,3,17,Mr Mackey,"I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him."
192,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year old son?!
193,3,17,Mr Mackey,"There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, ""How far will I go to save my son's life?"""
194,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, I won't have sex with him!"
195,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Well, I've said all I can say. [walks away, then turns] I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay? [walks away, then turns] Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison. [emphasizes each syllable] Don't lose... your son, m'kay? [walks out of the station]"
196,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
197,3,17,News Reporter Rick,"Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders. [Mr. Garrison walks to the stairs behind his father, but stops to watch the report] It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has..."
198,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad."
199,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Good night. [Yoko Ono finishes rambling incoherently]
200,3,17,News Reporter Rick,Words to live by.
201,3,17,Mr Garrison,[pause] Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
202,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Uh huh.
203,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[pause] Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something."
204,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,[flatly] Should be fine.
205,3,17,Mr Garrison,[pause] Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
206,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Won't be necessary.
207,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[steps up, then turns again] I'll just... be going up to bed now. [pause] Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers."
208,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,I'm not going to molest you!
209,3,17,Mr Garrison,You don't love me! [runs upstairs crying] I wanna die!
210,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"God-damnit! [pounds the arms of the chair with his fists, then rises and goes out the door.]"
211,3,17,Stan Marsh,I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
212,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. They think they're so cool.
213,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[rushing into the room with Kenny wearing earmuffs] You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!"
214,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Calm down, Cartman."
215,3,17,Stan Marsh,You found what?
216,3,17,Eric Cartman,"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. [places some earmuffs on Stan's head] There, okay. Let's see here. [places some earmuffs on Kyle and rushes back to his side of the room] Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?"
217,3,17,Kenny McCormick,"(Ready.) [Stan and Kyle look at each other and Cartman plays a fat bass note. Kenny farts] (Oh, [farts] shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) [rushes away]"
218,3,17,Stan Marsh,"[incredulous, removes his earmuffs] No way."
219,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,[removes his earmuffs] I don't believe it!
220,3,17,Eric Cartman,"[removes his earmuffs] Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. [leads them outside where a UPS delivery man is offloading packages, and the three put on their earmuffs. He whispers] Okay. [plays that bass note again]"
221,3,17,Delivery Man,"[farts] Whoa- Oh, my God! [grabs his belly and lets loose a long fart] Aaww, I crapped my pants! [rushes away with a brown stain on the seat of his pants. The boys remove their earmuffs]"
222,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,That's amazing.
223,3,17,Eric Cartman,I told you guys!
224,3,17,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
225,3,17,Eric Cartman,That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
226,3,17,Stan Marsh,No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
227,3,17,Eric Cartman,Ooooh.
228,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude!"
229,3,17,Eric Cartman,"They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously."
230,3,17,Patron 1,"Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad."
231,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, I'm having some troubles at home."
232,3,17,Patron 1,"Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas?"
233,3,17,Patron 2,[with mustache] Yeah.
234,3,17,Patron 3,"[with goatee] Yeah, that's right."
235,3,17,Patron 1,Yeah.
236,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?"
237,3,17,Patron 2,Sure!
238,3,17,Patron 3,Yeah we are!
239,3,17,Blond,[at a table] I am. I know that.
240,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?"
241,3,17,Patron 1,Absolutely.
242,3,17,Patron 2,Of course.
243,3,17,Patron 4,"Yeah, man."
244,3,17,Patron 5,"Come on, Garrison!"
245,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life? [the others ponder the question]
246,3,17,Patron 2,"...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?"
247,3,17,Patron 1,"Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your father's life?"
248,3,17,Arkansas Bar Patrons and Tender,"[wondering] Wooo, yeah."
249,3,17,Patron 2,"Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him""?"
250,3,17,Patron 1,Yeah.
251,3,17,Patron 2,"Oh, that's a tough one."
252,3,17,Patron 3,Hmmm.
253,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"No no wait, uh, you don't understand."
254,3,17,Blond,How about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life?
255,3,17,Arkansas Bar Patrons and Tender,"No, no, no way. No."
256,3,17,Patron 6,"But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father."
257,3,17,Patron 7,Yeup.
258,3,17,Patron 8,"Me, too."
259,3,17,Patron 9,"Well, I think that goes without saying."
260,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son."
261,3,17,Patron 8,"Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here?"
262,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Uh, he doesn't have a gun."
263,3,17,Blond,The father doesn't have a gun?
264,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,No! Nobody's got a gun!
265,3,17,Patron 3,"I think if someone said, ""Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son,"" but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it."
266,3,17,Patron 2,"He could have a knife, though."
267,3,17,Patron 1,Yeah.
268,3,17,Patron 3,Sure.
269,3,17,Patron 1,"Yeah, a knife."
270,3,17,Bartender,"If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, ""Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you,"" ...I would have sex with myself."
271,3,17,Patron 1,"...Yeah, I would [Mr. Garrison Sr. gets up and heads out the door]"
272,3,17,Patron 2,That's right.
273,3,17,Patron 3,Uh huh.
274,3,17,Bartender,That makes sense.
275,3,17,Patron 1,Mm-hm.
276,3,17,Patron 1,Wasn't that right?
277,3,17,Patron 3,"Mm, See?"
278,3,17,Stan Marsh,"How do we write he note, Cartman?"
279,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. [shows it to them on his book]"
280,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. [makes the change] Come on. [the boys leave their room again and head for the New York room.] There. [tapes the music to the door. Kyle sticks a small yellow Post-It note saying ""Revised Music for Tomorrow"" onto the music] That should do it."
281,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys."
282,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Okay, let's get back to the room. [the three walk off]"
283,3,17,Concert Coordinator,"[arrives and sees the change] What's this?? [looks more closely at it] ""Revised Music for Tomorrow""?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow??"
284,3,17,Chip,What??
285,3,17,Concert Coordinator,Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry! [hurries away.]
286,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[sighs, then softly] Dad? [the door opens to reveal his dad's shadow.] Pop, I'm just fast asleep—I'm not hearing anything. [the shadow moves closer and closer...]"
287,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[ecstatic] Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!"
288,3,17,Mr Garrison,"[well-rested and confident] Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon."
289,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?"
290,3,17,Mr Garrison,"No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have."
291,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again."
292,3,17,Mr Garrison,"We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to."
293,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son."
294,3,17,Mr Garrison,"I will. [hugs each parent] Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! [turns and heads cheerfully out the door] Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face..."
295,3,17,Mrs Garrison Sr,"You did the right thing, Poppa."
296,3,17,Mr Garrison Sr,"I didn't do squat! [goes inside and opens a door behind which is Kenny G] Here you go, a hundred bucks. [hands Kenny G the money]"
297,3,17,Kenny G,"Oh, that's okay. Keep your money. Thanks. [walks out and away]"
298,3,17,Announcer,"Live, from Oklahoma City! [its skyline is shown] Four million third-grade students [a crowd of them is shown] from all over the country [a school bus full of students is shown] playing ""My Country 'Tis Of Thee"" on their recorders... ""MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE"" special."
299,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants."
300,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
301,3,17,Kenny G,Are we all ready to play? [almost whispering] Thanks. Okay. [loudly] Let's see the music! [the music pops up on the stage wall]
302,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,This is gonna be sweet!
303,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, dude. Look! [the projected  music is shown] It's the music we changed! [the camera zooms in on the changed note]"
304,3,17,Eric Cartman,Uh-oh. [Kenny finally shows up]
305,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-"
306,3,17,Yoko Ono,"One, two, sign paytah. [Kenny G starts the tune, then the children join in]"
307,3,17,Stan Marsh,No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
308,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
309,3,17,Kenny McCormick,No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
310,3,17,Eric Cartman,No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
311,3,17,Stan Marsh,Stop! Stop! [he and the other three are near the stage...]
312,3,17,Mr Mackey,"Uh, aren't those our boys?"
313,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Oh, no. What are they doing?"
314,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]"
315,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]"
316,3,17,Kenny McCormick,"Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]"
317,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]"
318,3,17,News Reporter Rick,"[soberly] Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick?"
319,3,17,News Reporter Rick,"[A cleanup crew is shown at work, and the camera pans over to the reporter] Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere. [the stage and the lot are bare, except for poop everywhere] Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some [Kenny lies dead with rats nibbling on him] crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, ""How did this happen?"" [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk by, whistling]"
320,3,17,Kenny G,"Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well."
321,3,17,Yoko Ono,"[Chattering quickly in comical Asian-accented English] Wery well?! Wery well?! You're gonna be on Ricki Lake, I tell you again! Look at ad a bah godda circada she doin wery well?!"
322,3,17,Mr Mackey,"[the school buses are ready to take all the third graders back to their homes] Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come into view and stop]"
323,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, that whole experience sure did suck."
324,3,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. [Kyle and Cartman grin]"
325,3,17,Mr Mackey,"[passing by behind them] Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. [the boys look afraid to know]"
326,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
327,3,17,Tough Guy 1,[stopping by with two others] Here they are!
328,3,17,Tough Guy 2,Yeah!
329,3,17,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here."
330,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
331,3,17,Stan Marsh,Uuuuh...
332,3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, we knows all about it!"
333,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, no!"
334,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool."
335,3,17,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
336,3,17,Stan Marsh,You do?
337,3,17,Tough Guy 1,"Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shit themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!"
338,3,17,Tough Guy 2,"Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry."
339,3,17,Eric Cartman,"Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?"
340,3,17,Tough Guy 1,Yeah. See you guys later. [the three New Yorkers leave]
341,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus. [the boys get on and Kenny G stops by] Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G."
342,3,17,Kenny G,"Huhuh, good- good-bye. [hugs and kisses him]"
343,3,17,Mr Garrison,"M-m-m. [Kenny G releases and walks away] Oh, well, thank you! [steps towards the bus, then stops] You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad. [steps into the bus and faces the driver] Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home."
344,3,17,Ms Crabtree,Which way should we go?
345,3,17,Mr Garrison,"Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. [Ms. Crabtree starts the bus and drives as day fades into night. It goes over a rise and blinks out of view.]"
