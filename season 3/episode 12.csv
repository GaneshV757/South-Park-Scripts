0,3,12,Liane Cartman,"[sets the box down on the floor] Eric, Mommy got you a present!"
1,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[suddenly excited] A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!"
2,3,12,Liane Cartman,"Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow."
3,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[drops and sighs heavily] Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do."
4,3,12,Liane Cartman,"This year is gonna be different. Look! [places the box on the table] I got you ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics."" [mom and son look at each other]"
5,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[after a while] What the hell is ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"""
6,3,12,Liane Cartman,"It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee. [unpacks the contents: two cassette tapes, a tiny drum set, an owner's manual, and a live monkey. The monkey chatters] It says we just put the cassette into a tape player [does it, and presses the Play button. A glissant plays, and the monkey sits behind the drum set]"
7,3,12,Hooked On Monkey Fonics Female Voice,"Welcome to ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics,"" level 1. I will read the sounds and the monkey will help keep the beat. [Liane smiles] If your monkey arrived in the box dead, call 1-800-555-4500 to get a new monkey. Ready? Let's begin. [glissant. The monkey plays. A little rap follows]The learning monkey is here to sayThat reading is easy and it's okay.[Liane starts swaying like a metronome]Work with the monkey and you will learnTo spell hard words, like ""morbid"" and ""burn.""Start with Card 1. [Liane holds it up] Ready? Begin! [glissant] C, H. [a ""ch"" sound] Chalk. [the monkey plays four beats more, then turns to Cartman. One more beat...]"
8,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[finally responds, keeping the beat] C, H. ""Ch."" Chalk."
9,3,12,Hooked On Monkey Fonics Female Voice,"Good. Card 2. [Liane holds it up] T, H. [a hard ""th""] There."
10,3,12,Eric Cartman,"T, H. ""Th."" There. Hey, this is easy! [raps] I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!"
11,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals! [the crowd cheers. The Mayor walks over and stands next to Mr. Mackey. The new boy is gone!] This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary."
12,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks."
13,3,12,Gerald Broflovski,You bet money on my son to win?!
14,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew."
15,3,12,Eric Cartman,"You're going down, bitch!"
16,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you."
17,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! [signals something with a thumbs-up. The monkey and drums are next to him, on the floor.]"
18,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! [they enter...]"
19,3,12,Jimbo Kern,What?! [...and take their seats]
20,3,12,Eric Cartman,Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
21,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!"
22,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What's a ""home-schooled kid""?"
23,3,12,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. [the left side of the groups is shown. Mark, the new kid seen earlier, sits next to Token, and Rebecca takes the aisle seat. The others in their section study them.]"
24,3,12,The Cotswolds,"[cheering] Go, Mark! Go, Rebecca!"
25,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"[reads, then] Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school. [he steps on the platform] All right, Mark. Your word is ""conscientious."""
26,3,12,Eric Cartman,What?! What the fuck that that mean?
27,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"""Conscientious."" May I have the definition, please?"
28,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Closely attentive to details. Careful.
29,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"""Conscientious."" Could you use it in a sentence, please?"
30,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.
31,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"""Conscientious."" C O N S C I E N T I O U S."
32,3,12,Eric Cartman,[as the bell rings] Holy crap! [the crowd is stunned]
33,3,12,The Cotswolds,"Way to go, Mark! Alright!"
34,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman. [he goes to the platform, smiling] Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. [he looks to the monkey, who's minding its own business]"
35,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum! [it looks around] Come on! [it begins to drum something else, getting excited. Cartman looks resigned]"
36,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Eric, your word is ""chair."""
37,3,12,Eric Cartman,Uuh. Definition?
38,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Something you sit on.
39,3,12,Eric Cartman,Country of origin?
40,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"English! [the angrier she gets, the more afraid Mr. Mackey looks]"
41,3,12,Eric Cartman,Could you please use it in a sentence?
42,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is ""chair""!!"
43,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Uh- chair. C H A R E [the buzzer sounds and Eric panics] God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?! [races off the stage] Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!"
44,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school. [Rebecca takes the platform, but casts her eyes down and away from the mayor. She nervously taps her hands together] Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral."
45,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[voice quivering] ""Litoral."" Deh-finition?"
46,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Having to do with a lake or ocean.
47,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"""Litoral."" Will you please use it in a sentence?"
48,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
49,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"""Littoral."" [Before saying each letter, she opens her hands like a book, whispers the letter into them, and closes them] L I T O R A L"
50,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,[sounding the little bell] Correct!
51,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,[softly] Wow! [he's impressed]
52,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"[both parents clap] Alright, Rebecca. Good job, honey. [she takes her seat]"
53,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Now we have Kyle Broflovski. [he takes the platform] Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
54,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,What??
55,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Krocsyldiphithic.
56,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Definition?
57,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
58,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, could you use it in a sentence?"
59,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Certainly. ""Krocsyldiphithic"" is a hard word to spell."
60,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"""Krocsyldiphic."""
61,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"You can do it, kid! You can do it!"
62,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"""Krocsyldiphic."" C [the buzzer cuts him off] Damnit!"
63,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks. [Stuart, Gerald, Randy, and Ned start carrying him away] Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!"
64,3,12,Mayor McDaniels,"Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca. [hand them their trophies] You are truly South Park's finest. [a print photographer takes a picture]"
65,3,12,Stan Marsh,"[standing before the stage with Cartman and Kenny] Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart."
66,3,12,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. [the finalists come off the stage and stand in front of it.]
67,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to Rebecca] What's your name? [apparently, he wasn't paying attention...]"
68,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Guh what's in a name? [turns and walks away]
69,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Wooww.
70,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
71,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[mocking] Oh, yes. We must do it again."
72,3,12,Stan Marsh,We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
73,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"No. I live right over there. [points to a house like any other, but it has bars on its windows] I've lived there all my life."
74,3,12,Eric Cartman,How come you don't go to school?
75,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Because I'm home-schooled.
76,3,12,Stan Marsh,What's that?
77,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
78,3,12,Eric Cartman,You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
79,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Right.
80,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[waxes poetic]Who would have thought such a miracle could be?Who could have known that this moment I would see?A new way of living, a chance to be free?"
81,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman?"
82,3,12,Eric Cartman,"You shut up, [backhand slap] butthole."
83,3,12,Stan Marsh,"You shut up, [backhand slap] gaywad!"
84,3,12,Eric Cartman,"You shut up, [backhand slap] ass-logger!"
85,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[astonished] Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?"
86,3,12,Stan Marsh,"No, we're friends."
87,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Strange, friends would call each other names and fight."
88,3,12,Stan Marsh,What?
89,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel. [the family walks away. Kyle looks after Rebecca. Mark looks back at the boys.]"
90,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos."
91,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Papa?
92,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Yes, Mark?"
93,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
94,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,[gasps] Oooh.
95,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"[leans in on Mark] Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!"
96,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá."
97,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,"Mark, you have play time. You get to play in the afternoon."
98,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like."
99,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it."
100,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days."
101,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!"
102,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Hooray!
103,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?"
104,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[voice quivering] Oh, heavens, no."
105,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe! [the doorbell rings and all look towards it]"
106,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[Mrs. Cotswolds opens the door] Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?"
107,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,Yes she is. [doesn't move]
108,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"...Uuh, can I talk to her?"
109,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,"Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca! [Rebecca walks up] This little boy wants to see you."
110,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[with hands in prayer pose] Huhlo? [Kyle looks a little dismayed, as her tapping of hands is a habit. He looks at her mom for any assistance, but sees none. He looks at Rebecca again]"
111,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"U-u-uh, hi. [puts his hands behind his back]"
112,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Hel-lo.
113,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. [turns and hurries away. Rebecca looks, then goes in. Her mom closes the door]"
114,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,[walks up] Who was that?
115,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.
116,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,[wary] Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
117,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,"But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children."
118,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close! [they then stand motionless for a while]"
119,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? [A large plastic ball rolls into class, and Mark is inside driving it. He runs into Craig's chair and stops.]"
120,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Hey, guys. What's up?"
121,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?"
122,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America? [Mark and Cartman vie to answer] Ehyes, Mark?"
123,3,12,Eric Cartman,Ey! How come you never pick me?!
124,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?"
125,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade."
126,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!"
127,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. [every kid looks angrily at Mark.]"
128,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground."
129,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from? [again, Mark and Cartman vie to answer] Put your hand down, creampuff."
130,3,12,Eric Cartman,That does it! [gets off his seat and moves towards the door] I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
131,3,12,Stan Marsh,"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass."
132,3,12,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! [leaves and closes the door]"
133,3,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, please God, let it be forever."
134,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me."""
135,3,12,Pip Pirrup,"But, if I say that, you'll hit me."
136,3,12,Stan Marsh,"No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say ""Please, hit me,"" I won't hit you."
137,3,12,Pip Pirrup,"Please, hit me."
138,3,12,Stan Marsh,All right. [backhand slap]
139,3,12,Pip Pirrup,Ooowww!
140,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip."
141,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[rolls up] I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. [Craig and Butters walk up]"
142,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball."
143,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
144,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. [moves out of the way as Craig and Butters position the ball]"
145,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench."
146,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
147,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!"
148,3,12,Boys,"Okay, let's get him... [more chatter as they place him on the bench and duct-tape him to it]"
149,3,12,Butters Stotch,Got it. [the boys disperse]
150,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!"
151,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!"
152,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Oh, dear."
153,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now."
154,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,I'm sure he's alright.
155,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"[a thump on the door] That must be him. [thump. Mr. Cotswolds opens the door, and both parents look]"
156,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,Waaaaah! [Mark has walked home still strapped to the bench]
157,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Oh my God, son!"
158,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. [walks in]"
159,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Mark, what have they done to you?!"
160,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Well, they duct-taped me to a bench."
161,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,But why?
162,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all."
163,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!"
164,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"But I want to go back tomorrow, papá."
165,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,What??
166,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Please, just give me one more day. [walks off]"
167,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,What do we do?
168,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers. [snort, snort. He seems to have a little problem with phlegm in the nose]"
169,3,12,A voice,"[with guitar]Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you, Rebecca.[she stops writing and looks to the window]I don't know what to do, Rebecca.[she hops off the chair, walks over to her toy box and hops onto it]You're so nice, I'd like to get to know you better.[she looks out the window. It is Kyle she sees]So what do you say we get together?You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!Rebecca, you're really quite good-looking!You're a fox.[she looks a bit more, then moves away from the window. Kyle waits, then brightens as she returns. She drops some money down to him, and it lands in the guitar case. She moves away again, and he looks at the money]"
170,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments. [the other men turn to face him] My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy. [sniff]"
171,3,12,Randy Marsh,"Uh, look, Mr...."
172,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,Cotswolds.
173,3,12,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own."
174,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better. [the men get mad. He coughs, then points to Gerald] And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop."
175,3,12,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff."
176,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?"
177,3,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once."
178,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!"
179,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?"
180,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers."
181,3,12,Jimbo Kern,You what??
182,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"See ya, Cotswolds. [Randy looks and grins] Thanks for stopping by."
183,3,12,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah. See ya. [the camera pans down to show Mr. Cotswolds duct-taped to a bench]
184,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
185,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,[walks up] Can I sit here with you?
186,3,12,Stan Marsh,"[tsk] Aw, man, if you have to."
187,3,12,Principal Victoria,"[over the P.A.] Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early."
188,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
189,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. [laughs]"
190,3,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)"
191,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
192,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff."
193,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place."
194,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,What??
195,3,12,Craig Tucker,"[leading a group of boys, walks up] Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?"
196,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[confidently] Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me."
197,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Ah, dude, you don't say that."
198,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Huh?
199,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Get him! [the group grabs him and duct-tapes him to an adjacent bench, then walks away.]"
200,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school."
201,3,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
202,3,12,Eric Cartman,[sighing drowsily] Eeehhh.
203,3,12,Announcer,Welcome to Huntin' and Killin' with Jimbo and Ned.
204,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Eehh, shut up. [stretches] Ooohhh, yeasss."
205,3,12,Liane Cartman,"[opens the door] Hon, are you ready for some math problems?"
206,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door."
207,3,12,Liane Cartman,"Oh, all right. [sets them on the nightstand]"
208,3,12,Eric Cartman,Mom?
209,3,12,Liane Cartman,Yes?
210,3,12,Eric Cartman,Could you turn up the heat just a little?
211,3,12,Liane Cartman,"Sure, hon. [turns it up and walks out]"
212,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules. [turns to his right side] Yeeehhhhhhss! [goes to sleep.]"
213,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Oh, hel-lo."
214,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,"
215,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?"
216,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
217,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Woowould you like to come up to my room?
218,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Uuuh, okay. [she yanks him in] Gah!"
219,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school."
220,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?"
221,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise."
222,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,Alright. [starts to shuffle away]
223,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Mark, where's your sister?"
224,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
225,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Oh, alright."
226,3,12,Both parents,What?! [they dash to her room]
227,3,12,Mrs Cotswolds,Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo!
228,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Rebecca, don't play that perverted game! [reaches the door and opens it. Before them is Kyle on his back on a low table covered by a blanket. Rebecca, in scrubs, stands on a chair cutting away at Kyle's hat. Both look at her parents]"
229,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses."
230,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling! [snorts twice and leaves with his wife]
231,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go."
232,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[voice quivering] Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go."
233,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,You will?
234,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,[voice quivering] I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.
235,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No no. I mean, go with me."
236,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride. [walks off to her home-schooling. Kyle gets mad and bangs his head against her chair]"
237,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Ahhhhhhhhh. [""Jesus and Pals"" is heard in the background] Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired."
238,3,12,Liane Cartman,"[opens the door] Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs."
239,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. [sighs]"
240,3,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, please. We have to do some studying today."
241,3,12,Eric Cartman,"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. [she looks over and sees the Fonics Monkey tossing a box of Snacky S'mores around. She withdraws and Cartman yawns again. Stan and Kenny enter]"
242,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?"
243,3,12,Eric Cartman,"[sleepily] Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys."
244,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, get your ass out of bed! [Kenny walks off] We have to go deal with that home-school kid!"
245,3,12,Eric Cartman,"Huh, I can't. I'm too tired. [moves to sleep again] Maybe tomorrow."
246,3,12,Kenny McCormick,"[to the monkey] (Hey, can I have that?) [reaches for a Snacky S'more in the monkey's hand, but the monkey tosses it away] (Heey.)"
247,3,12,Stan Marsh,But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
248,3,12,Eric Cartman,[sleepily] That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
249,3,12,Kenny McCormick,"[smacked against a nightstand by the monkey] (Hey!) [the monkey starts tossing him around like a box] (Hey, Cartman, help me.)"
250,3,12,Eric Cartman,"No, Fonics Monkey! [the monkey throws Kenny up against the ceiling and stomps on him] No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! [the monkey smashes Kenny against the foot of Cartman's bed several times, then stomps on him until he no longer responds]"
251,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!"
252,3,12,Eric Cartman,"You're damn straight, he did."
253,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,You got my note?
254,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,[voice quivering] Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?
255,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, can we sit down?"
256,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Wha-y noh-ot? [leads him onto a nice path next to a lovely flowerbed with all sorts of flora] Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it. [picks a flower]
257,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that... [draws close] flicker of light over there?"
258,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"I... [looks down and away, pulls away a bit] have looked at it."
259,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children, [draws close] just like us."
260,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
261,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light. [they walk over to a stone bench and sit] Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study"
262,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Well, what else would one do?"
263,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Love, for one thing."
264,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,And woowhat is love?
265,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss."
266,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Woowhat means ""ki-iss""?"
267,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
268,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me."
269,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Rebecca, in public school, [hops down] we select our... own mate. [walks off a bit] In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy."
270,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss. [he turns to face her] So I cold write about it. [Kyle walks back and sits on the bench] How do we do it?"
271,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not completely sure.
272,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Should we... [looks at him] l-look it up?
273,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. [she hums as they get closer and closer. Their lips touch. A quick kiss and they pull apart]"
274,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"Wow. Wow, that was fun! [grabs him]"
275,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dah. [she kisses him back, then lets go] Does that mean you'll go to the dance?"
276,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.
277,3,12,Craig Tucker,"Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole."
278,3,12,Stan Marsh,Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
279,3,12,Craig Tucker,"That's the point, buttpipe."
280,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!"
281,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape."
282,3,12,Boys,Hooray! [they walk away]
283,3,12,Bill,Hooray. [catches up to the others]
284,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"[arrives with a group of men] Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. [Randy, Gerald, Ned, and Stuart are also present]"
285,3,12,Randy Marsh,"Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?"
286,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
287,3,12,Gerald Broflovski,The flagpole! That's great! [Mr. Tweek and Craig's father are now present]
288,3,12,Jimbo Kern,Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
289,3,12,Men,[walk away] Alright!
290,3,12,Stan Marsh,"[sees Kyle enter and walks to him] Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? [with him are Craig, Butters, and Cartman.]"
291,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,[with a bouquet of flowers] I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
292,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, brother! [shows his displeasure to the others]"
293,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!"
294,3,12,Stan Marsh,"You suck now, Kyle! [walks away with the other boys]"
295,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,You suck!
296,3,12,Principal Victoria,"[on stage] Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! [walks off as the curtains part. Dio appears with his band. The kids look back and say nothing]"
297,3,12,Ronnie James Dio and Band,"Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?! [silence] I said, are you ready to rock?!"
298,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess."
299,3,12,Ronnie James Dio and Band,"Then let's hit it! [the band begins to play] I know you all remember this one. It's off my first solo album. The song that you all helped me make number 1.Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.Oh, what's-"
300,3,12,Craig Tucker,"[""-becoming of me?""] Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid! [Mark enters and stands next to Kyle] Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! [""Ride the tiger.""]"
301,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? [""You can see his stripes but you know he's clean.""]"
302,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[dressed as a slut] Hi, guys. [""Oh, don't you see what I mean?"" She walks up to Butters, kisses him, and walks away]"
303,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Woo-oh Holy Cow! [Kyle and Mark are quite surprised. ""Gotta get away.""]"
304,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[walks over to Token] He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay? [grabs his ass and walks off]"
305,3,12,Token Black,"What the-? Damn, baby. [rubs his ass. Red looks angrily at Rebecca. Kyle is shocked, and Mark has left]"
306,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"[walks over to Kyle] Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?"
307,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Rebecca. You...
308,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[returns] Rebecca, what the devil are you doing? [Pip walks by]"
309,3,12,Rebecca Cotswolds,"I'm... having... fun, Mark. [reels Pip back and kisses him]"
310,3,12,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, my goodness! [hurries off]"
311,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,You're out of control. [turns to Kyle] You did this to my sister!
312,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Uh. All I did was show her how to-
313,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! [leaps at him and slaps him around. The kids gather around to watch the fight, and Dio plays on. Mark throws Kyle into the air]"
314,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,[landing on his back] Aaaah!
315,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,[pounces on again] You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! [slaps him around some more]
316,3,12,Kyle Broflovski,Ooww!
317,3,12,Craig Tucker,Oh my God!
318,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!"
319,3,12,Butters Stotch,Yeah. He's a badass! [smiles]
320,3,12,Randy Marsh,"[entering] Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. [takes Kyle with him]"
321,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"...I'm not through with you, bitch! [Stan walks up]"
322,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. [Butters walks up]"
323,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too."
324,3,12,Stan Marsh,"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? [Craig walks up]"
325,3,12,Craig Tucker,[grabbing Mark's right hand] No! He's my friend!
326,3,12,Butters Stotch,"[grabbing Mark's left hand] Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! [Mark smiles, pleased that these guys would fight for his friendship]"
327,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,[enters another door with his wife] They've got to be here somewhere.
328,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!"
329,3,12,Men,Yeah! [move forward. Mr. Cotswolds goes to some outlet and unplugs the sound system. Dio stops playing]
330,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
331,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"[onstage, takes the mic from Dio] Calm down, papá! [Papá looks at Mom] Everything is all right. [the kids look at him] You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on. [his parents listen] Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. [Rebecca is listening]"
332,3,12,Butters Stotch,"Well, she sure is."
333,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. The men listen]"
334,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,"Mark. You're absolutely right. [Mark grins. His mom grins as well] Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school."
335,3,12,Kids,Alright! [Rebecca goes up to Kyle and kisses him]
336,3,12,Stan Marsh,"[goes onstage] Nice speech, nerdo."
337,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"Thanks, gaywad. [Cartman joins them]"
338,3,12,Eric Cartman,Now you're gettin' it.
339,3,12,Jimbo Kern,"Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!"
340,3,12,Men,Hooray!
341,3,12,Mr Cotswolds,What?! [the men hoist him up and carry him out the doors]
342,3,12,Mark Cotswolds,"See ya, papá! [Dio takes the mic back]"
343,3,12,Ronnie James Dio and Band,"Well, I'm glad we all learned something today, kids. Now, let's dance! [resumes with ""Holy Diver."" The Fonics Monkey is drumming with the band. Mr. Cotswolds is now duct-taped to the flagpole]"
