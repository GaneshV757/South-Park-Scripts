0,3,8,Stan Marsh,I don't want to go to this stupid party!
1,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time."
2,3,8,Stan Marsh,"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels."
3,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it."
4,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm."
5,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him."
6,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement."
7,3,8,Stan Marsh,Awww!
8,3,8,Mr Mackey,"[leads the family across the room] Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita? [clap clap] Juanita? [clap clap] We need some more finger sandwiches? [she scurries by]"
9,3,8,Stan Marsh,I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
10,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time."
11,3,8,Mr Mackey,"[opens a door] Here you go, it's right in here. [Stan enters and gasps. Before him are Pip, Butters, and Dougie.]"
12,3,8,Randy Marsh,"We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan."
13,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[soft but urgent, tugging at Randy's pants] Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!"
14,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"You have fun, Stanley."
15,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[soft but urgent, tugging at Sharon's dress] No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!"
16,3,8,Mr Mackey,"We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts. [closes the door. Stan looks at it with hands in pockets, then he looks at the other kids. Pip, Butters, and Dougie smile at him. Stan tries to open the door, but it's locked. He turns to face his peers.]"
17,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here."
18,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Pip."
19,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however."
20,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Butters, is there any way out of here?"
21,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room. [motions to the little boy to his left] Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think."
22,3,8,Dougie,I like math.
23,3,8,Stan Marsh,Oh my God.
24,3,8,Pip Pirrup,We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
25,3,8,Stan Marsh,No.
26,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams [Butters bows] We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, ""Turrah!"" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar? [Stan just looks at them] And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
27,3,8,All three,"Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. [Stan tries opening the door again]"
28,3,8,Mr Garrison,"[quite drunk] Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass. [his right hand jerks to the right, pulling him] No! Mr. Hat, you get back here! [walks away. The Marshes and the Broflovskis stand in front of the punch bowl]"
29,3,8,Mr Mackey,Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
30,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol."
31,3,8,Mr Mackey,[offers the drink] Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. [Sharon takes it]
32,3,8,Randy Marsh,"One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little."
33,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. [she takes a sip]"
34,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, experiment."
35,3,8,All three,"[dancing] Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la."
36,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"[all turn 'round] Wickersham tally-ho ugh. [all fall on their backs. Pip gets up] Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?"
37,3,8,Stan Marsh,[looks back] Yes.
38,3,8,Dougie,What are you? A sourpuss?
39,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice. [Pip walks off] Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh? [annoyed, Stan covers his ears] They got those thick noses and all."
40,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"[looks in a box] Hey, look at this!"
41,3,8,Butters Stotch,Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. [he and Dougie reach the box and look in]
42,3,8,Pip Pirrup,[leafing around] It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.
43,3,8,Dougie,[pulls out a padded bra and checks it out] Neato.
44,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels."
45,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[incredulous] Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me."
46,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"[hopping] Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?"
47,3,8,Butters Stotch,"No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it."
48,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"[twirls with joy] Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed. [walks over to Stan] Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?"
49,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!"
50,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Well. [turns and walks away] Alrighty then.
51,3,8,Mr Mackey,Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
52,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Wow, neat!"
53,3,8,Sheila Broflovski,It looks quite inviting.
54,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub."
55,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut."
56,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Hell, we should get in."
57,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah.
58,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?"
59,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear."
60,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Hm huheh, that's okay. [giggles]"
61,3,8,Sheila Broflovski,No hot tub for me!
62,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, screw you guys! [disrobes and jumps in]"
63,3,8,Randy Marsh,"I'm getting in for a while, too. [disrobes and jumps in] Geronimo!"
64,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, look at our boys, Sheila. [Randy and Gerald splash each other] It's just like they're in college again."
65,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?"
66,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?"
67,3,8,Dougie,How should I know?
68,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission."
69,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. [strokes his chin. All three look around, but the silence alerts Stan]"
70,3,8,Stan Marsh,[looks back displeased] What?
71,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?"
72,3,8,Stan Marsh,[grudgingly] What do I have to do?
73,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it."
74,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast."
75,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, that's a splendid mission!"
76,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! [they go in different directions, but Dougie pauses]"
77,3,8,Dougie,Which Angel am I again?
78,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?"
79,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
80,3,8,Randy Marsh,"I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things."
81,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar. [brushes it under his nose and sniffs it] Only 'cause I've never smoked before. [picks up a lighter and lights the cigar, then sets the lighter back]"
82,3,8,Randy Marsh,Good idea.
83,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
84,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Hohn. [raises his elbows to the rim] Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me."
85,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
86,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Huh? Oh, you mean, this?"
87,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Yeah.
88,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. That, that was me."
89,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Bosley! Bosley!
90,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[in no mood for role-playing] What, Pip?"
91,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
92,3,8,Stan Marsh,What the hell do you want?!
93,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs."
94,3,8,Stan Marsh,You did? [rises and walks to the way]
95,3,8,Dougie,[dressed as Jill] Air shaft.
96,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown."
97,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"So Bosley, what's our next mission?"
98,3,8,Stan Marsh,We're going upstairs.
99,3,8,Butters Stotch,Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
100,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! [crawls into the duct]"
101,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot."
102,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
103,3,8,Randy Marsh,"O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that."
104,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
105,3,8,Randy Marsh,[eager to know] With two girls or two guys?
106,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... [ends up staring at Randy]"
107,3,8,Randy Marsh,"You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have."
108,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,You haven't?
109,3,8,Randy Marsh,"No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?"
110,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy."
111,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?"
112,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"NO, no, uh I don't think so."
113,3,8,Randy Marsh,...Well it is a night for experimenting.
114,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Sure is. [both of them wait for the other to make the first move, then...]"
115,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Okay, I'll start. [begins]"
116,3,8,ATF lead,This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.
117,3,8,ATF agent,[talks into a communicator] Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup. [the ATF lead looks at the house again]
118,3,8,Officer Barbrady,"[immediate indeed, appears in the lead's sights] Okay, so just what is going on here, people?"
119,3,8,ATF lead,Get down! [pulls him into position along with the others]
120,3,8,Officer Barbrady,What?
121,3,8,ATF lead,"It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. [resumes viewing, but is interrupted]"
122,3,8,Officer Barbrady,Are you sure?
123,3,8,ATF lead,"Of course we're sure! [points out the initials on his cap] We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do!"
124,3,8,Officer Barbrady,So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
125,3,8,ATF lead,"Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them."
126,3,8,ATF lead,What's the situation?
127,3,8,ATF agent,"[coming in from reconnaissance] Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts."
128,3,8,ATF lead,Any luck talking to somebody in the house?
129,3,8,ATF agent,"We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir."
130,3,8,ATF lead,Alright. Johnson!
131,3,8,Johnson,"[a marksman, runs up] Sir!"
132,3,8,ATF lead,I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.
133,3,8,Johnson,"Yes, sir! [makes his way to the front door while stopping at various points for better views. He rings the doorbell with his elbow, but doesn't wait for an answer]"
134,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay? [Johnson, surprised, lowers his guard] Would you like a meteor mai tai?"
135,3,8,Johnson,"Heeey, I love mai tais! [closes the door]"
136,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"We did it! Great job, Angels!"
137,3,8,Butters Stotch,"So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?"
138,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[mischief flashing across his face] Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set."
139,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?"
140,3,8,Stan Marsh,"I don't care, just hurry! [the Angels walk away]"
141,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Well, hooray!"
142,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,[buttoning his jacket] So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
143,3,8,Randy Marsh,[tying his shoes] ...Yeah.
144,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?"
145,3,8,Randy Marsh,"No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?"
146,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
147,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. [turns to go in]"
148,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey. [Randy looks] Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends."
149,3,8,Randy Marsh,Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. [goes inside]
150,3,8,ATF lead,"Damn it, where is Johnson?!"
151,3,8,ATF agent,"No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him."
152,3,8,ATF lead,Those bastards!
153,3,8,Man,"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much."
154,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?"
155,3,8,Woman,"We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again."
156,3,8,Mr Mackey,"Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay? [waves them off and closes the door]"
157,3,8,ATF lead,"[On a bullhorn] Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it! [the man shrugs] Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan!"
158,3,8,Man,What?
159,3,8,ATF lead,"Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot- [Shooting starts. The couple falls dead and the lead lowers the bullhorn] God damn it, who was that?! [most of the agents raise their hands] Did you see them move?!"
160,3,8,Agent 1,...I did.
161,3,8,Agent 2,[next to floodlight] Yah.
162,3,8,Agent 3,"Yeah, they moved alright."
163,3,8,Jimbo Kern,"Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year."
164,3,8,Burly man,"Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?"
165,3,8,Blond man,I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
166,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?"
167,3,8,Jimbo Kern,...What??
168,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself."
169,3,8,Burly man,Well... Let's go kick his ass!
170,3,8,Other men,Yeah!
171,3,8,Jimbo Kern,Where is he?!
172,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida."
173,3,8,Burly man,Aw! [the men disperse]
174,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[walks up] Hey, Randy. What are you doing? [pats him on the back]"
175,3,8,Randy Marsh,[subdued] Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
176,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Can I come with you?
177,3,8,Randy Marsh,[softly] Okay. [rolls his eyes]
178,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea. [Pip and Dougie are already inside, waiting] Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was."
179,3,8,Stan Marsh,Rad! [hops on the bed and starts switching channels]
180,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?"
181,3,8,Stan Marsh,There are no more missions. I have everything I want. [four shows and a commercial pass by as he channel-surfs.]
182,3,8,Butters Stotch,Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
183,3,8,Stan Marsh,[annoyed] Just... play something else! God!
184,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
185,3,8,Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts."
186,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, cool!"
187,3,8,Dougie,I wanna be a reporter someday.
188,3,8,Reporter,"Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house. [footage of it is shown] According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued."
189,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits."
190,3,8,Reporter,The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks. [choppers and tanks are heard coming in] The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.
191,3,8,Stan Marsh,[as the reporter speaks] Wait a minute [hops off the bed and walks towards the window. He looks out and sees the ATF] Oh my God! [runs back to the others] Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
192,3,8,Dougie,Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
193,3,8,Reporter,We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house [Stan looking out the window just moments before] showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!
194,3,8,Stan Marsh,Dude!
195,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?"
196,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission."
197,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"[sits] Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you."
198,3,8,Randy Marsh,I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
199,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"So, so now we can't be friends?"
200,3,8,Randy Marsh,"I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody."
201,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,We said we'd never tell anybody?
202,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[now cross] Well, of course we wouldn't."
203,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, uh I didn't realize that. [looks away ashamed]"
204,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[sensing betrayal] Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?"
205,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, uh uh a few people, yeah."
206,3,8,Randy Marsh,[hushed] What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
207,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,You didn't say not to tell anyone.
208,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[hushed] Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! [looks around in desperation to make sure no one else is listening]"
209,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
210,3,8,Randy Marsh,AAAW!! [jumps up and hurries away]
211,3,8,Stan Marsh,[rushes out with the others in tow] Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! [sees everyone quite drunk. A naked man dances by with a lampshade on his head] The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. [the adults didn't hear him]
212,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?"
213,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[sees his mom waddle by] Mom, go look outside."
214,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"[drunk, with mai tai in hand] Mommy's little boopie-kins [falls down and out]"
215,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh let me handle this, Stan. [walks forward] Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! [The adults laugh and his face drops]"
216,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. [walks to the door. The others follow]"
217,3,8,ATF lead,Lay down your weapons!
218,3,8,Stan Marsh,We don't have any weapons.
219,3,8,ATF lead,"Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them. [Shooting starts]"
220,3,8,Butters Stotch,Whoa!
221,3,8,Stan Marsh,Get back inside! [opens the door and the boys hurry in]
222,3,8,ATF lead,I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.
223,3,8,Officer Barbrady,What's the Ganz technique?
224,3,8,ATF lead,"This is what we did in Waco. [two monster speakers are moved into place on either side of the front of the house. A technician readies the large CD player] Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out. [the technician presses a button and a garbled song plays] Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will."
225,3,8,Mr Garrison,"That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?"
226,3,8,Mr Mackey,Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
227,3,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, hell, turn it up."
228,3,8,Goateed man,"Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay."
229,3,8,Other man,"Oh, is he?"
230,3,8,Randy Marsh,[runs up] Who?!
231,3,8,Goateed man,Huh?
232,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Who who did you hear is, is gay?!"
233,3,8,Goateed man,"Ricky Martin, the singer."
234,3,8,Randy Marsh,Oh. [the two men walk away as Gerald approaches]
235,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, Randy, what's up?"
236,3,8,Randy Marsh,[tenses up] What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
237,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Huh?
238,3,8,Randy Marsh,Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
239,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
240,3,8,Randy Marsh,There's nothing to talk about.
241,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"You're having regrets, aren't you?"
242,3,8,Randy Marsh,"No, I-... I don't know."
243,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Hey. Talk to me.
244,3,8,Randy Marsh,No!
245,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
246,3,8,Randy Marsh,Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
247,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do."
248,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Aaww! [rushes away] Sharon? [finds her at a table and genuflects] Sharon, cuh can we go?"
249,3,8,Sharon Marsh,[swaying] Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
250,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[his voice grows urgent] Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now."
251,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!"
252,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Ogh, I already did."
253,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[rushes up with the other boys] Dad! Dad, they shot at us."
254,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Not now, Stanley. [gets up and walks away. Stan watches him go, then turns to Sharon]"
255,3,8,Stan Marsh,Mom!
256,3,8,Sharon Marsh,"Whoopee! [gets up, and the bowl of chips drops to the ground. She faints on the table. Stan looks around, not sure how he can rouse the adults to action, drunk as they are.]"
257,3,8,Butters Stotch,"[panicking] Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families."
258,3,8,Stan Marsh,"[slaps Butters across the face with a backhand and grabs him by the collar] Get a hold of yourself, man!"
259,3,8,Butters Stotch,"How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?"
260,3,8,Stan Marsh,Come on. We have to find out what's happening. [leads the other boys to the bedroom]
261,3,8,Reporter,"I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?"
262,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now."
263,3,8,Dougie,See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
264,3,8,Reporter,"So what are your plans, commander?"
265,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out."
266,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-"
267,3,8,Stan Marsh,Sh!
268,3,8,Reporter,"Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander."
269,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"It is, but we can't let them kill themselves."
270,3,8,Stan Marsh,We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
271,3,8,Pip Pirrup,But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
272,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on."
273,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. [walks off]"
274,3,8,Reporter,"For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out."
275,3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay? [Harold is wearing a lampshade, but he's fully dressed. The camera moves to the crowd, then to the ground, where Dougie is standing with microphone in hand]"
276,3,8,Dougie,"This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party. [Stan is filming, Butters is cuing] As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us. [aside] Anything else?"
277,3,8,Stan Marsh,Tell them not to burn us down.
278,3,8,Dougie,"Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news."
279,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Now what do we do?
280,3,8,Stan Marsh,[removing the tape from the camera] Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
281,3,8,Dougie,"Hey, I'm a real reporter."
282,3,8,Stan Marsh,"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. [Dougie smiles]"
283,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs. [turns off the bullhorn and listens for a moment] Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator! [a large truck hauls a large cannon in. The barrel of the cannon reads, ""NEGOTIATOR""]"
284,3,8,Reporter,"[approaches] Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?"
285,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
286,3,8,Reporter,"Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves."
287,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,[holds out a beanie baby] Look. You see this? You see this?
288,3,8,Reporter,Yes.
289,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"You see it? You see it? Go get it. [throws it away to his left] Go get it! [the reporter soon moves in the direction of the throw] Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!"
290,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Having a good time?
291,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?"
292,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,"I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-"
293,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[irritated, interrupts] We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! [walks away]"
294,3,8,Guest,"Good night, everyone."
295,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Look out! [Shooting starts. Screams are heard as the guests are hit. The guests die on the spot] Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. [on the bullhorn] People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender! [the Negotiator is aimed right at the front door]"
296,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh no, we're out of time! [hops down and moves away. He ties some rope around Butters' middle] Are you sure you can do this, Butters?"
297,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?"
298,3,8,Stan Marsh,"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. [hands him the video]"
299,3,8,Butters Stotch,Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
300,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Can you hit a target, Pip?"
301,3,8,Pip Pirrup,[with bow and plunger] I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. [pulls back on the bow]
302,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Hit something nice and solid now. [Pip releases the plunger, with rope attached, and it lands on the left side of Barbrady's head. Barbrady moves just a bit, then sips his coffee]"
303,3,8,Pip Pirrup,[pulls the rope taut] I think that's got it.
304,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Nice job, Pip."
305,3,8,Pip Pirrup,Did I do a nice job? Really?
306,3,8,Stan Marsh,"Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. [he and Dougie help Butters onto the window sill and hook him up to the rope]"
307,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now. [Dougie pushes him off] Waaah! [slides down to Barbrady and bounces off the hook] Gooh. [runs to the reporter]"
308,3,8,Stan Marsh,He made it down. [Pip and Dougie grin]
309,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! [the agents take aim]"
310,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?"
311,3,8,Reporter,Huh?
312,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. [hands it to the reporter, who inspects it]"
313,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,[walks up] Honey?
314,3,8,Randy Marsh,"[hushed] God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows."
315,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
316,3,8,Randy Marsh,What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
317,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,I just want to know it meant something to you.
318,3,8,Randy Marsh,"It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry! [the music stops] All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! [people turn and stare. One man gasps and Sharon lifts her head from the floor]"
319,3,8,Man in briefs,"Aw, I was just in the hot tub. [a man next to him pulls away]"
320,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares! [shots of various people looking at him] We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!"
321,3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it."
322,3,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmm-me too. [other men begin to answer]
323,3,8,Man 1,"Yeah, uh I've done it a few times."
324,3,8,Man 2,Yep.
325,3,8,Man 3,Yup.
326,3,8,Man 4,Uh huh.
327,3,8,Man 5,Me too.
328,3,8,Man 6,"Myeup, me too."
329,3,8,Man 7,Yup.
330,3,8,Jimbo Kern,"Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. [points to the burly man who spoke earlier]"
331,3,8,Mr. Mackey,"[music resumes] Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita? [she goes to do it, and conversation resumes among the guests]"
332,3,8,Randy Marsh,You mean it? I'm not gay?
333,3,8,Jimbo Kern,[walks up] Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
334,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!"
335,3,8,Gerald Broflovski,So we're friends again?
336,3,8,Randy Marsh,"Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!"
337,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"Alright everyone, fire!"
338,3,8,Reporter,"[runs in front of the cannon and waves his arms] Hold on just a minute! This is Derek Smalls reporting. We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house [holds it up], proving that the people inside are not cultists after all."
339,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"[to an agent] Uh oh. [runs to address the agents and waves his arms] Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation."
340,3,8,Blond agent,Simulation?
341,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"[to the blond] Sh. [to all] All is well. Do not shoot at [BOOM. The cannonball hits a house behind Mackey's, then bounces to crush another, then another, and yet another. Stan, Pip, and Dougie rush outside to join the reporter.]"
342,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day! [Butters joins them]"
343,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,Woops.
344,3,8,ATF agent,"Sir, this isn't gonna look good."
345,3,8,ATF agents and Commander Danny Ganz,"You're right. Quick, let's get out of here! [in the blink of an eye, every ATF agent and vehicle rushes away, leaving a clear road]"
346,3,8,Derek Smalls,"Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys."
347,3,8,Dougie,"Wow, you mean that?"
348,3,8,Derek Smalls,"Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams. [walks away with the tape]"
349,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!"
350,3,8,Pip Pirrup,"There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job."
351,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya."
352,3,8,Stan Marsh,"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along."
353,3,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?"
354,3,8,Kyle Broflovski,[shows up] Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
355,3,8,Stan Marsh,You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
356,3,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh, dude, weak."
357,3,8,Stan Marsh,Super weak.
358,3,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. [goes inside with Stan and Ike, leaving the Melvins outside sad.]"
