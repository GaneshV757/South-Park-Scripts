0,3,1,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people [she walks to the group and smiles] for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame [she frowns], but please, give her your full attention. [to her] Go ahead."
1,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. [cheerfully] How are we all doing today?! [the kids' eyes wander] I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! [Cartman farts]"
2,3,1,Mr Garrison,"[angrily] Eric Cartman, you say ‘’excuse me”!"
3,3,1,Eric Cartman,Okay.
4,3,1,Mr Garrison,[to the choir teacher] Go ahead.
5,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Children, we are a national choir called, ""Getting Gay With Kids!"" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!"
6,3,1,Kenny McCormick,This sounds fucking screwed. [the others laugh]
7,3,1,Mr Garrison,"Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! [to the choir teacher] Go ahead."
8,3,1,Choir Teacher,"You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir [Pip yawns and Bill notices. Clyde nods off] where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest."
9,3,1,Choir Boy,"[steps forward] Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?"
10,3,1,Choir Girl,"[steps forward] That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen [Kenny sees her and begins to swoon] is made in the rainforest. [smiles back at him. Kenny's in love - ahem, distracted. The camera stays on him]"
11,3,1,Choir Teacher,"So, who wants to join the fun??"
12,3,1,Eric Cartman,What if you don't have any rhythm?
13,3,1,Choir Teacher,Excuse me?
14,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm."
15,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, fatass!"
16,3,1,Stan Marsh,Choirs suck.
17,3,1,Mr Garrison,"Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! [sighs deeply and tells the choir teacher] Go ahead."
18,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, uh, that's all, really. [the girl picks her nose, smiling at Kenny] So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front."
19,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. [the other kids laugh]"
20,3,1,Mr Garrison,"All right, that does it!!"
21,3,1,Mr Mackey,"[behind the door] I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man! [The camera is now inside] You get sent here every day, Craig!"
22,3,1,Craig Tucker,I know.
23,3,1,Mr Mackey,Why can’t you behave?
24,3,1,Craig Tucker,...I don’t know.
25,3,1,Mr Mackey,"What do you have to say for yourself?! [nothing] Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- [Craig sticks his right middle finger up] Did you just flip me off?"
26,3,1,Craig Tucker,No.
27,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- [Craig flips Mr. Mackey off again] There! You just flipped me off again!"
28,3,1,Craig Tucker,No I didn’t.
29,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! [Craig hops off the chair as the door opens. The boys enter.] Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. [Craig exits]"
30,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Craig."
31,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Ey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!"
32,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-"
33,3,1,Stan Marsh,It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
34,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh, young man, ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors."
35,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes.
36,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Well, guess what, boys? I think that ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you."
37,3,1,Stan Marsh,What?!
38,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,You can't do that! [Cartman's jaw drops]
39,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Woohoo! [the boys look at him] I mean, 'Oh.' [looks down]"
40,3,1,Mr Mackey,I think this will be very good for you [writes their names down]
41,3,1,Stan Marsh,But we don't even care about the rainforest.
42,3,1,Mr Mackey,And that's exactly why you need to go!
43,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[drops down and pleads] Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey."
44,3,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest."
45,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints."
46,3,1,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, I didn't realize."
47,3,1,Choir Boy,"Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?"
48,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[as he enters the bus] Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls."
49,3,1,Stan Marsh,"[As Sharon drags him to the bus] Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!"
50,3,1,Sharon Marsh,"Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. [tosses him into the bus]"
51,3,1,Stan Marsh,Nooo-ho! [The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]
52,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest."
53,3,1,Eric Cartman,Whoopee.
54,3,1,Choir Teacher,And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
55,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much."
56,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo."
57,3,1,Choir Girl,[Kenny sits next to her] My name's Kelly.
58,3,1,Kenny McCormick,My name’s Kenny.
59,3,1,Kelly,Lenny?
60,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"No, it’s Kenny."
61,3,1,Kelly,Johnny?
62,3,1,Kenny McCormick,Kenny!
63,3,1,Kelly,Oh. [looks away and picks her nose.]
64,3,1,Choir Girl,"Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography."
65,3,1,Eric Cartman,[hushed] The nightmare begins.
66,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. [the kids move to their windows and look out] Oh! This is so exciting!"
67,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!"
68,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S."
69,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! [Throws open his window and yells] Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!"
70,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, sit down!"
71,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[sits] Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? [Kenny looks at him angrily] Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor."
72,3,1,Kenny McCormick,[to Kelly] Argh! That's just so untrue.
73,3,1,Kelly,[picks her nose] Your family isn't poor? [picks her nose]
74,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, dude, look over there! [The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.] Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!"
75,3,1,Redheaded Prostitute,"[with heavy accent] What are chu looking at, man?"
76,3,1,Middle Prostitute,"Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?"
77,3,1,Eric Cartman,Okay. [pretends] Kugheek! [grins]
78,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, SIT DOWN!"
79,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-"
80,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[rushing out] Oh my God, [covers his nose] it smells like ass out here."
81,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Alll right, that does it! [turns Cartman around] Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!"
82,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[covers his nose again] I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass."
83,3,1,Kelly,"Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?"
84,3,1,Kenny McCormick,[in bliss] Uh-huh. [Kelly picks her nose again]
85,3,1,Choir Teacher,"You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-"
86,3,1,Eric Cartman,"I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!"
87,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?"
88,3,1,Eric Cartman,Why?
89,3,1,Choir Teacher,Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
90,3,1,Eric Cartman,Eh-heheh!
91,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow."
92,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,[long pause] ¿Qué?
93,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?"
94,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,[long pause] ¿Qué?
95,3,1,Choir Teacher,"We're the group singing for the ""Save The Rainforest"" summit tomorrow? [her head is cocked way to the left by now. El Presidente has no clue. Now the teacher is worried] Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. [faces the kids] Children, do any of you speak Spanish? [Cartman waves his left arm] Don't you dare! [the main door opens]"
96,3,1,Mr Mackey,[rushing in] Sorry I'm late.
97,3,1,Choir Teacher,Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
98,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Oh, no problem. [to El Presidente and his men] Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?"
99,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest.
100,3,1,Choir Teacher,Yeess!
101,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla. [Pablo appears]
102,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour."
103,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. [moves aside]"
104,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,[long pause] ¿Qué?
105,3,1,Choir Teacher,"All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin."
106,3,1,Kelly,"[walks over to Kenny, her partner] Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?"
107,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Yeah, I think so."
108,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. [chuckles and shrugs. The people just look. She presses the play button. The kids begin to dance to the music]"
109,3,1,The Tape,"[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing]There's a place that is magical, and full of rain.
[Women sing] But now it needs help, because it is in pain.
[Men sing] Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore
[All sing] We're spreading awareness like never before!
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle is out of step now]
To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay!

[Bridge. Man sings] Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
[Woman sings] There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world!
[Man joins her] World!
[Chorus. Kids rush into the audience and bring some members back as new partners]
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!
[The kids regroup and Kyle stumbles into place. The tape is stopped and the subjects just walk away]"
110,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle."
111,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks!
112,3,1,Eric Cartman,I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
113,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Fuck off, Cartman!"
114,3,1,Stan Marsh,"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right."
115,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,[alarmed] No! That's a stereotype.
116,3,1,Stan Marsh,Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. [Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle]
117,3,1,Pablo,This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
118,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!"
119,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"God-damn, it's hot out here!"
120,3,1,Stan Marsh,[sees a branch] Aaah! Snake!
121,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude. That's a branch."
122,3,1,Stan Marsh,Oh. [sees it again] Aaah! Snake!
123,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,No. That's the same branch again.
124,3,1,Stan Marsh,Oh.
125,3,1,Pablo,"[turns and stops the group] The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it."
126,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[impatient] Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. [Pablo looks at him] We hear this a million times back up in the States."
127,3,1,Pablo,"Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. [one sits in a tree, resting] Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest."
128,3,1,Kelly,"Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? [takes a picture]"
129,3,1,Eric Cartman,[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey] Bad! Bad monkey! [it screams in pain]
130,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Eric, what the heck are you doing?? [the monkey flees]"
131,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[stops] I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head!"
132,3,1,Pablo,And here is a three-toed sloth. [hangs from a branch with all four legs]
133,3,1,Eric Cartman,[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth] It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
134,3,1,Choir Teacher,"[pulls him away] Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!"
135,3,1,Eric Cartman,[throws the branch at the sloth] Re’spect my authoritah!
136,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!"
137,3,1,Kids,YEAH!
138,3,1,Choir Boy,I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.
139,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,What's the Yanogapa?
140,3,1,Choir Teacher,"The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!"
141,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[fed up, buries his face in his mitts] Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!"
142,3,1,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAA! [hides behind a girl]
143,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Stanley, what is it?"
144,3,1,Stan Marsh,SNAAAKE! [all see and gasp]
145,3,1,Pablo,"[standing next to the snake wrapped around a tree trunk] Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature."
146,3,1,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAA! [runs farther back]
147,3,1,Pablo,"What's the matter, little boy?"
148,3,1,Eric Cartman,"He's a little wuss, what's it look like? [Stan is hiding behind some foliage]"
149,3,1,Stan Marsh,[lifts some away] I'm just a-scared of snakes.
150,3,1,Pablo,"Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. [the snake jumps out of the tree and wraps itself around him, suffocating him] Oh!! [the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls] Agh."
151,3,1,Choir Teacher,[in horror] Oh my God!! [the snake starts swallowing Pablo]
152,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!"
153,3,1,Choir Teacher,"[petrified] Jesus Christ, is he dead?! [Pablo's bones come out of the snake's anus]"
154,3,1,Stan Marsh,Dude!
155,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,My guess would be yes.
156,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, no! God, no, no! [spins around] Don't panic, children."
157,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him] Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! [hurries away, and the snake gives chase]"
158,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Maybe we came from that way. [points to her left] No, nno. Let's try this way. [points to her right and moves that way]"
159,3,1,Kelly,[walking behind Kenny] Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
160,3,1,Kenny McCormick,[stops] Yeah. Everything is fine.
161,3,1,Kelly,That's good. Can I tell you something?
162,3,1,Kenny McCormick,Okay.
163,3,1,Kelly,I think I like you. [holds his shoulder]
164,3,1,Kenny McCormick,Really?!
165,3,1,Kelly,"[releases] Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well."
166,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Oh, that's great!"
167,3,1,Kelly,"[looks away] No, that's not good."
168,3,1,Kenny McCormick,That's not good?
169,3,1,Kelly,"No. See, if I start to like you too much, [looks away] I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. [looks at him again] Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. [grabs him and gets emotional] And that would devastate me. [lets go] So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! [walks away]"
170,3,1,Kenny McCormick,[pissed] Aaaargh!
171,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!"
172,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?"
173,3,1,A Boy,I’m not.
174,3,1,Choir Teacher,Who's not?!
175,3,1,A Boy,Me.
176,3,1,Kelly,"Benny, will you hold my hand? [picks her nose. When she lowers her hand, Kenny grabs it, but she looks away] I don't want to get emotionally attached, though."
177,3,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!"
178,3,1,Choir Teacher,"No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley."
179,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"[on stage] Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.) [the worker moves along]"
180,3,1,Mr Mackey,"[approaching] Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)"
181,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
182,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)"
183,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!)
184,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)"
185,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderan este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)"
186,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llegá- llegáran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)"
187,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!"
188,3,1,Kelly,We are?
189,3,1,Choir Teacher,"Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us."
190,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back."
191,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, really? Could you brush it off? [shows her backpack, and a huge insect half her size growls on it]"
192,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Um, no."
193,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[panics] Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! [the insect growls and falls silent. Miss Stevens returns] Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. [sees the insect, still on her back] Oh my God!! [runs off]"
194,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
195,3,1,Kelly,"Me, too! [the rest start to groan]"
196,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-"
197,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,[Kyle runs into an adult] Aaaaa! There's a dude here! [a soldier holding a shotgun]
198,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost. [giggles] Cah heh, can you help us?"
199,3,1,Solider,¿Qué?
200,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[moves forward] Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. [the soldier listens] We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. [rubs his belly]"
201,3,1,Stan Marsh,"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme."
202,3,1,Eric Cartman,Y taco.
203,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
204,3,1,Eric Cartman,Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
205,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. [the soldier points a way out with his thumb] Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! [they leave]"
206,3,1,Stan Marsh,This doesn't look very safe.
207,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
208,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government. [addresses them with a lilt] Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?"
209,3,1,People s Army Leader,[crisp] Who are you?!
210,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. [the soldiers just stare] We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? [no response] Um... [thinks] Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song [she moves aside]"
211,3,1,Kids,"Honh. [she presses the play button, and the song plays. The kids begin to dance]"
212,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[through clenched teeth] Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography. [as the chorus nears, Kyle is still doing the wrong moves] Oh, Kyle, please! [the kids dance through the first line of the chorus...]"
213,3,1,People s Army Leader,Enough! [the music stops]
214,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts."
215,3,1,People s Army Leader,"We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?"
216,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?"
217,3,1,People s Army Leader,"Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi. [the other men begin to laugh] Now, get out of here before we kill you!"
218,3,1,Miss Stevens,[sullen] Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
219,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Hey!
220,3,1,People s Army Leader,"[the soldier next to him cocks his shotgun] You white Americans make me sick! [emphasizes his disgust with thumps on the table] You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers."
221,3,1,People s Army Leader,"[waving the choir away] ¡Rapido, rapido! [Kenny steps in front of Kelly to shield her from any shots coming their way]"
222,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Run, children, run! [the choir moves out]"
223,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,¡¿Donde putos está el coro?! ¡El espectáculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)
224,3,1,Mr Mackey,"No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estáran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)"
225,3,1,Miss Stevens,Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
226,3,1,Choir Boy,"Wow, look at the pretty flower. [stops by to touch a huge yellow flower with blue support on a large green stalk]"
227,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay? [before she could finish the sentence, the flower wraps its petals around Jake and pulls him off the floor.]"
228,3,1,Jake,"Aaaah. Ugh, help!"
229,3,1,Miss Stevens,[quakes] Ga-ow! [quickly grabs Jake's feet and pulls. The choir walks on]
230,3,1,Kelly,[crying and pouting] I wanna go home! [Kenny stops and turns] I hate the rainforest!
231,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"[walks up and puts his arm around her] Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear. [comforted, she smiles]"
232,3,1,Kelly,"[gushing] Oh Lenny, hold me. [moves away] No, I can't get attached. [pause, then moves closer] Oh, but I do like you."
233,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Well, I like you-"
234,3,1,Kelly,"[moves away] Oh, but you're only going to leave me."
235,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"[pissed] Oh, God damn it!"
236,3,1,Short Reporter,"We're here live in San José, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril."
237,3,1,Slim Reporter,"That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, ""Getting Gay With Kids,"" all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment."
238,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[the problems mount] Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job! [another large insect roars behind her backpack, and she jumps] Aaaah!"
239,3,1,Eric Cartman,[turns and walks back the way they came] This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
240,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Eric, where are you going?"
241,3,1,Eric Cartman,I'm going this way!
242,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!"
243,3,1,Eric Cartman,"[stops] Look: you can stay over nyah [gestures towards her], but I'm going over nyah. [Gestures away from her]"
244,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Young man, I have had it!!"
245,3,1,Eric Cartman,"Nononono! You nyah, me nyah! [gestures forward and backward] Screw you guys, I'ma going home. [walks away]"
246,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard! [the others watch him leave] Eric, we have to stay together!"
247,3,1,Eric Cartman,God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat- [finds himself at a clearing full of bulldozers moving wood around] Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! [rushes in]
248,3,1,Stan Marsh,Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
249,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. It happened once before.
250,3,1,Miss Stevens,No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
251,3,1,Eric Cartman,[reaches the foreman] Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
252,3,1,Foreman,"What are you doing here, little boy?"
253,3,1,Eric Cartman,"I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!"
254,3,1,Foreman,"Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?"
255,3,1,Eric Cartman,Food! I have to have food! [falls on his face]
256,3,1,Fireman,"Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!"
257,3,1,Eric Cartman,[lifts his head] Chicken wings. [drops it]
258,3,1,Foreman,Chicken wings!
259,3,1,Eric Cartman,[lifts his head] Medium spicy. [drops it]
260,3,1,Crowd,Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!
261,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"La gente está ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)"
262,3,1,Mr Mackey,"Estoy seguro que llegáran. Eh-solo poquito mas de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)"
263,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos. [heads for center stage] (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)"
264,3,1,Mr Mackey,Mbien.
265,3,1,El Presidente de Costa Rica,"[on the mike] ¿A cuantos Polacos les toma a comerse un burrito? [the crowd is silent. He holds up two fingers] Dos. [seeing no reaction, he laughs, then tries again] ¿A cuantos Polacos les toma a manejar a Panamá? (How many Pollacks does it take to eat a burrito? Two. How many Pollacks does it take to drive to Panama?)"
266,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!"
267,3,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? [a column of smoke is seen floating above the canopy]"
268,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Let's go, quickly! [they rush towards the column and find a small campfire]"
269,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. [the shrubs around them rustle, and they face the shrubs. Some big-lipped dwarves surround them.]"
270,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Children, it's the Yanogapa. [to the dwarves] Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest. [the group is surrounded by spear-bearing Yanogapa men.]"
271,3,1,Yanogapa 1,Damtilié?
272,3,1,Yanogapa 2,Damtilié?
273,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[marveling] Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble... [the Yanogapa raise their spears high] Run for your lives, children!"
274,3,1,Stan Marsh,Holy crap! [all run]
275,3,1,The Yanogapa (with Giant Yanogapa),[giving chase and throwing spears] Damtilié! Damtilié! Damtilié!
276,3,1,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ!
277,3,1,Miss Stevens,Run run ruuun! [A huge insect lands on her backpack and roars. She looks back and the insect flies away] Waaah!
278,3,1,Kelly,"[trips and falls down] Aaaaa! Lenny! [Kenny goes back, helps her up, and they keep running. The choir runs across a puddle of quicksand and begin to sink]"
279,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell?
280,3,1,Stan Marsh,We're sinking.
281,3,1,Miss Stevens,"It's quicksand, people! [the Yanogapa warriors surround them and leap with excitement, still screaming ""Damtilié!""]"
282,3,1,Stan Marsh,"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""!"
283,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! Fragile my ass!
284,3,1,Kelly,"Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! [snuggles up to him]"
285,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Kelly, you said it!) [she tries to pick her nose, but the ropes won't let her]"
286,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[put off] Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people? [a giant Yanogapa rises from the brush and his voice rumbles across the rainforest. She responds] AAAAA!!"
287,3,1,Kelly,"Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!"
288,3,1,Miss Stevens,"All right, that does it!! [the men stop dancing] Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!! [the giant Yanogapa is shocked] I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!"
289,3,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, now she figures it out."
290,3,1,Foreman,Quick! Everybody help the children!
291,3,1,Stan Marsh,Wow!
292,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Bulldozers rule!
293,3,1,Foreman,[cutting the ropes off the kids] Come on! Let's get you back to civilization!
294,3,1,Kids,HOORAY!!
295,3,1,Miss Stevens,"[being cut down by a worker] Hooray, children!"
296,3,1,Miss Stevens,How did you know where we were?
297,3,1,Foreman,Your little friend helped me out.
298,3,1,Miss Stevens,Eric?
299,3,1,Eric Cartman,[arriving] Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
300,3,1,Miss Stevens,"What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?"
301,3,1,Foreman,We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard.
302,3,1,Miss Stevens,Really? [excited] That's great!!
303,3,1,Foreman,"You mean, you don't mind?"
304,3,1,Miss Stevens,"Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!"
305,3,1,Foreman,That’s swell!
306,3,1,Kelly,"Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day."
307,3,1,Kenny McCormick,"Okay. I can do that. [lightning strikes him, knocking her away] (Christ!) [he falls, she gets up and goes to him]"
308,3,1,Kelly,Aaaah! Lenny! No! [Stan and Kyle rush in]
309,3,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
310,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
311,3,1,Kelly,[turns to face them] Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!
312,3,1,Stan Marsh,They did.
313,3,1,Kelly,"Who's ""they""?!"
314,3,1,Stan Marsh,"[pause] You know, ""they."""
315,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,They're... they're bastards.
316,3,1,Kelly,"Well don't just stand there, help him!!"
317,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?
318,3,1,Stan Marsh,Help ...him?
319,3,1,Kelly,"Aaagh! [turns around and pounds on Kenny's chest] Come on, Benny! Breathe! [she tries giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, then pounds on his chest again] Breathe, you son of a bitch! [she picks her nose, then pounds some more. Kenny coughs, and she listens]"
320,3,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
321,3,1,Summit Host,"And now, here to teach us about the rainforest is Getting Gay With Kids. [the crowd applauds]"
322,3,1,Miss Stevens,Does everybody remember the new lyrics? [the kids nod yes] And…
323,3,1,The New Lyrics,"[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing] There's a place called the rainforest; it truly sucks ass.
[Women sing] Let's knock it all down and get rid of it fast.
[Men sing] You say, ""Save the rainforest,"" but what do you know?
[All sing] You've never been to the rainforest before.
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle still can't dance]
To tell you things you might not like to hear. [Kenny and Kelly exchange glances]
You only fight these causes 'cause caring sells.
All you activists can go fuck yourselves!"
324,3,1,Male Activist,That was so inspiring.
325,3,1,Female Activist,What a wonderful message.
