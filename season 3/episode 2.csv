0,3,2,Stan Marsh,"[with an air pump] Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?"
1,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I don't think so."
2,3,2,Kenny McCormick,[bringing a hair dryer] How about this?
3,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, that's a hair dryer!"
4,3,2,General Store Manager,May I help you find something?
5,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?"
6,3,2,General Store Manager,Any what?
7,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,I need to get a nurection for my dad.
8,3,2,General Store Manager,"Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it. [gestures to the exit with his thumb]"
9,3,2,Stan Marsh,Why is that funny?
10,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one. [the boys are suddenly outside, with the door slamming shut behind them] Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? [the boys walk away]"
11,3,2,Stan Marsh,That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
12,3,2,Kenny McCormick,"You guys, take it seriously."
13,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
14,3,2,Man,[walks by with his lady] What?
15,3,2,Kenny McCormick,"Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town."
16,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?"
17,3,2,Kenny McCormick,"Yeah, you guys. Seriously."
18,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-"
19,3,2,Kenny McCormick,Ach. [Poof. Stan and Kyle turn. All three are left looking at a charred body]
20,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
21,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
22,3,2,Eric Cartman,What the hell happened to him?
23,3,2,Stan Marsh,He just... ignited.
24,3,2,Man,[rushing up] What happened?
25,3,2,Woman,[rushing up] I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. [Barbrady drives up and screeches to a halt]
26,3,2,Officer Barbrady,"[rushes up to the boys] Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room."
27,3,2,Blond Man,I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.
28,3,2,Man 2,Is it contagious?
29,3,2,Woman,Am I going to spontaneously combust?
30,3,2,Man 3,I hope it doesn't happen to me.
31,3,2,Woman,This is very scary.
32,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
33,3,2,Randy Marsh,"...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist."
34,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,Right.
35,3,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth."
36,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park. [Randy begins to daydream]"
37,3,2,Crowd,Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
38,3,2,Man,"We love you, Randy."
39,3,2,Woman,"[rushing up] Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
40,3,2,Randy Marsh,Wow.
41,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!"
42,3,2,Randy Marsh,Or else what?
43,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,[pounds on her desk] Exactly!
44,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on."
45,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. [The boys hop off the bier and move to the front row for the service as Priest Maxi approaches the coffin. He opens the Bible and reads]
46,3,2,Priest Maxi,"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays [Kevin falls asleep, Stuart reads Gazongas magazine and checks out its centerfold while his wife sniffs], the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy…"
47,3,2,Mr Garrison,"[to man to his left] Oh, here comes the guilt trip again."
48,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Now, let us pray. [all close their eyes and bow their heads] Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen."
49,3,2,All,Amen.
50,3,2,Priest Maxi,[raises left arm and fist] Let's go-
51,3,2,All,Let’s go
52,3,2,Priest Maxi,Broncos
53,3,2,All,Broncos
54,3,2,Priest Maxi,Let’s go Broncos
55,3,2,All,"Broncos, let's go! [The priest extends the fist and all rise and exit. Three men carry the coffin out]"
56,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Wow, that was short. [Priest Maxi stops them as they leave the pew]"
57,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately."
58,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I'm Jewish."
59,3,2,Priest Maxi,"You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?"
60,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,I guess not.
61,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?"
62,3,2,Stan Marsh,The what?
63,3,2,Priest Maxi,"It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ."
64,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!"
65,3,2,Priest Maxi,Huh?
66,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,We'll do it! We'll do it!
67,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys. [hands it to Kyle and walks away. The cover shows two excited kids under a radiant cross]"
68,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?"
69,3,2,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible."
70,3,2,Tom,"Good night, Jerry."
71,3,2,Jerry,"See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen."
72,3,2,Helen,"Bye, Jer- aaa! [poof. Now she combusted]"
73,3,2,Jerry,"Oh my God, another one."
74,3,2,Tom,"Helen, no!"
75,3,2,Jerry,What happened?
76,3,2,Man 5,"[consoling Tom] God must be very angry with us. But why? [looks to the heavens] How have we angered you, Lord?"
77,3,2,Randy Marsh,"[to himself] Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no."
78,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Dad, where's our Bible?"
79,3,2,Randy Marsh,"Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else."
80,3,2,Stan Marsh,Or else what?
81,3,2,Randy Marsh,Exactly.
82,3,2,Stan Marsh,...What?
83,3,2,Randy Marsh,Right.
84,3,2,Stan Marsh,[after a long pause] Where's our Bible?
85,3,2,Randy Marsh,"It's in the attic with the old LP's. [the boys start up the stairs...] Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?"
86,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
87,3,2,Randy Marsh,New girlfriend?
88,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?"
89,3,2,Randy Marsh,Maybe nothing... [close up] maybe everything.
90,3,2,Stan Marsh,"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. [the boys go up the stairs and exit]"
91,3,2,Randy Marsh,"[resumes the reactions] Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do. [the door closes] What?!"
92,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets."
93,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,This is gonna be fun.
94,3,2,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna be Jesus!
95,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,You're too fat to be Jesus!
96,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!"
97,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,Stan should be Jesus.
98,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! [gestures his intent.]"
99,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,You're such a fat baby!
100,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. [gestures again, and again]"
101,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!"
102,3,2,Eric Cartman,"[retorts] Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't."
103,3,2,Randy Marsh,"All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him. [four men dressed as the boys stand before him] Now, walk. [the men move around] Do you feel hot?"
104,3,2,Kenny McCormick,"Uh, no."
105,3,2,Randy Marsh,Damn it! How come you're not combusting? [throws down his clipboard]
106,3,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight."
107,3,2,Townsman,[rushing in with several other people] Another one! Another one combusted! [pours out the ashes for Randy to see]
108,3,2,Randy Marsh,No! Has she been doing anything odd?
109,3,2,Townsman,"No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house."
110,3,2,Randy Marsh,Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
111,3,2,Eric Cartman,"This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home. [walks off]"
112,3,2,Randy Marsh,No! I think I might have it.
113,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little ""nervous"" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?"
114,3,2,A few people,Yeah.
115,3,2,Priest Maxi,"Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things. [all bow their heads] Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen. [Stan and Kyle approach the pulpit, followed by Cartman] And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross. [leaves, and Stan takes over]"
116,3,2,Crowd,Awww.
117,3,2,Stan Marsh,Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
118,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Die! [hits Cartman, dressed as Jesus, with a stick]"
119,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God."
120,3,2,Crowd,Awww.
121,3,2,Someone,Phew.
122,3,2,Stan Marsh,Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
123,3,2,Eric Cartman,"[now carrying the cross] This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak."
124,3,2,Stan Marsh,"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. [this is not part of the Stations]"
125,3,2,Eric Cartman,Peter!
126,3,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know you, dude."
127,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess."
128,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,Mayor.
129,3,2,Randy Marsh,"[calling from his lab] Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust."
130,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,Why?
131,3,2,Randy Marsh,Dialog
132,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park."
133,3,2,Crowd,Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
134,3,2,Man,"We love you, Randy."
135,3,2,Woman,"[rushing up] Make love to me, Randy. Please!"
136,3,2,Randy Marsh,Wow. [hangs up the phone]
137,3,2,Mayor McDaniels,[hangs up the phone] Shmuck!
138,3,2,Stan Marsh,Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. [Kyle has tied Cartman to it]
139,3,2,Eric Cartman,Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
140,3,2,Stan Marsh,"[produces a crown of thorns] Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks."""
141,3,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven. [Stan replaces Cartman's cap with the crown] So I guess it's cool. [Stan returns to the pulpit]"
