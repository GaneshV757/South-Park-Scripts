0,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Ready? 1-2-3-4. [the boys begin to march forward and play.]
1,3,14,Cartman,"Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?! [answers himself] Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!"
2,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
3,3,14,Cartman,I'm playing the drum.
4,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Well, you have to hit it softer!"
5,3,14,Cartman,"You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! [to the drum, hitting it once in a while] Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!! [to Kyle] That's how you rock, dude."
6,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!"
7,3,14,Cartman,I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
8,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!"
9,3,14,Cartman,"Ey, I'll get it!"
10,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!"
11,3,14,Cartman,Yes I will!
12,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. [again, the march and play. Cartman gets carried away and the others glare at him]"
13,3,14,Cartman,"Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, dammit!"
14,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Cartman!!! [Cartman stops]
15,3,14,Cartman,What?
16,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Give me the drum, and you play the flute."
17,3,14,Cartman,No way! Flutes are totally gay!
18,3,14,Kenny McCormick,[inspects his flute] (Oh. Flutes are gay?)
19,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!"
20,3,14,Cartman,"Oh! Well, you know what I say?! [drops his drum and jumps on it] Screw you guys, I'm going home! [walks away, leaving the drum split in two]"
21,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,You dick!
22,3,14,Cartman,Later.
23,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield. [the townsmen are dressed in the Blue and the Grey] First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!"
24,3,14,Men,"[jump and cheer] Yes! Woohoo, yea!"
25,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. [Kyle and Kenny are also present]"
26,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,He'll show.
27,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,He'd better!
28,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores."
29,3,14,Men,Whoa. Mmm.
30,3,14,Mr Garrison,Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.
31,3,14,Stuart McCormick,"[coughs] Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too."
32,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh, [Grandpa rolls up in his wheelchair amid applause] the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924."
33,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?"
34,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Dude, that's not cool."
35,3,14,Cartman,"[arrives dressed in the Grey] Good morning, gentlemen."
36,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?"
37,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
38,3,14,Cartman,"Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time."
39,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!"
40,3,14,Cartman,"Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did."
41,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead."
42,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!"
43,3,14,Cartman,"Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win."
44,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"No they're not, stupid!"
45,3,14,Cartman,Yes we are!
46,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,How much do you wanna bet?!
47,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. [continues as the boys speak]"
48,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!"
49,3,14,Cartman,"Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month."
50,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
51,3,14,Cartman,Right.
52,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,You're on!
53,3,14,Cartman,"Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. [walks away]"
54,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Hoohoo what a dumbass!
55,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
56,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
57,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!"
58,3,14,Men,"[jump and cheer] Yes! Woohoo, yea!"
59,3,14,Announcer,"Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South [Butters is there]; in blue are the Union, from the North [Chef is there, and Kenny has the drum]."
60,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"[addressing the spectators] It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle. [blows the whistle]"
61,3,14,Jimbo Kern,[leading the South] Forward! [The South advances]
62,3,14,Randy Marsh,"[leading the North] Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! [the North advances, the boys play their tune]"
63,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Fire! [some guns go off]
64,3,14,Confederate Reenactors,Yeah!
65,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Alright men, fire! [some guns go off]"
66,3,14,Union Reenactors,"Yeah! [the battle is joined, and men left and right begin to drop away. Others scream]"
67,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down."
68,3,14,Ned Gerblansky,[Jimbo fires a few shots] Ow.
69,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Yeh-hah! [the battle continues, and even a cow gets into the act]"
70,3,14,Man 1,"[in the stands] Oh, so this is what it was like. [the battle continues, but now it's hand-to-hand combat. Cartman reaches the bell and starts to push it down the hill]"
71,3,14,Man 2,Hey! What's that guy doing?!
72,3,14,Cartman,Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
73,3,14,Reenactors,[on both sides] Huh? Wha-?
74,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,What the hell?
75,3,14,Randy Marsh,He took the bell!
76,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,He can't do that!
77,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
78,3,14,Cartman,[skating by on the bell] Hooray for the South!
79,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Cartman, you can't do that!"
80,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,God dammit! Now we have to start over!
81,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Alrighty everyone. [Cartman walks up] We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time."
82,3,14,Cartman,But why? Why should they get the bell?
83,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose."
84,3,14,Cartman,But we don't have to lose.
85,3,14,Jimbo Kern,What??
86,3,14,Cartman,"[assuming command] Gentlemen, we can win this battle! [paces] Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" [some of the men drink schnapps]"
87,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[takes a swig] By God, he's right!"
88,3,14,Mr Garrison,Jimbo!
89,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!"
90,3,14,Mr Garrison,Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
91,3,14,Stuart McCormick,I'm tired of losing this battle!
92,3,14,Jimbo Kern,And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
93,3,14,Reenactors,Yeah!
94,3,14,Reenactor,Yeah! [drops down drunk. Cartman grins]
95,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to- [turns at the sound of a gun shot and looks as the Confederates charge down the field]"
96,3,14,Confederate 1,Yaaaaah!
97,3,14,Confederate 2,Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!
98,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, what are they doing?"
99,3,14,Mr Garrison,[drunk] You Yankee sons of bitches!
100,3,14,Randy Marsh,[a Confederate shoots him on the belly] Ow! That hurt!
101,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"God dammit, what the hell are they doing?!"
102,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,What do we do?!
103,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Run for your life, dude! [the boys run off. Cartman watches from the hill as the battle rages on]"
104,3,14,Cartman,God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
105,3,14,Reenactor,Come on!
106,3,14,Randy Marsh,[tackled by Jimbo] Oh?
107,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[pins Randy to the ground] Surrender your men, general!"
108,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!"
109,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!"
110,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Alright, alright. We surrender. [the Union soldiers drop their guns and raise their arms. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk out from behind a tree with their hands up.]"
111,3,14,Barbrady,[in the stands] The South win?
112,3,14,Jimbo Kern,The South wins!
113,3,14,Reenactors,"Yeah, woohoo!"
114,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,God dammit!
115,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[walks up to Randy] Well, we can all be friends now. [nudges him] Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. [hands Randy a bottle]"
116,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment."
117,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Aw, come on. Have a little sip. [Randy sips]"
118,3,14,Cartman,"[walks up to Stan and Kyle] So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?"
119,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"You cheated, Cartman!"
120,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!"
121,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!"
122,3,14,Cartman,[sighs] I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. [the men are getting more drunk]
123,3,14,Randy Marsh,[talking to Stuart with slurred speech] All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
124,3,14,Mr Garrison,"That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!"
125,3,14,Bartender,Yeah.
126,3,14,Reenactor,Yeah.
127,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,You're dreaming!
128,3,14,Cartman,[walks up to Jimbo] Perhaps we should take Topeka.
129,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Huh?
130,3,14,Cartman,"They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah."
131,3,14,Jimbo Kern,They don't?!
132,3,14,Cartman,No. I say we take Topeka.
133,3,14,Jimbo Kern,[to the crowd] You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
134,3,14,Randy Marsh,Huh?
135,3,14,Stuart McCormick,That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
136,3,14,Mr Garrison,I'll bet we could!
137,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"I'll bet we could, too! [pounds on the podium]"
138,3,14,Cartman,[throwing his voice] I'll bet you can't.
139,3,14,Jimbo Kern,[jumps back] What?! [then walks and stands in front of the podium] Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
140,3,14,Cartman,"[fake voice] I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!"
141,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
142,3,14,Reenactor 1,Yeah.
143,3,14,Reenactor 2,Yeah.
144,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[walks to the Union soldiers] All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!"
145,3,14,Reenactor 3,Yeah.
146,3,14,Reenactor 4,Yeah.
147,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Well, the Union be damned!"
148,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Let's go!
149,3,14,Men,Yeah! [all walk out]
150,3,14,Cartman,"[trailing, stops by his friends] Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month."
151,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop."
152,3,14,Cartman,"Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens."
153,3,14,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!) [exits with Cartman. The men charge out of the banquet hall growling]
154,3,14,Mailman,"Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis."
155,3,14,Mrs Hollis,"Hello, Ralph."
156,3,14,Ralph,Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?
157,3,14,Mrs Hollis,I'm afraid I was grading papers pretty late and- [both turn in the direction of a rumble. Everyone stops and looks in the same direction]
158,3,14,Driver,"What's that noise, officer? [the officer looks, and the South Park men rise over a hill and charge towards town.]"
159,3,14,South Park Men,Yeah! Yeah!
160,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
161,3,14,Topeka Traffic Officer,[soothing his ass] Ow!
162,3,14,Stuart McCormick,"Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! [the church bell rings. Jimbo is pulling at the rope]"
163,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!"
164,3,14,Reenactors,Yeah!
165,3,14,Randy Marsh,"[still holding Ralph] Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!"
166,3,14,Ralph,"Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store."
167,3,14,Randy Marsh,WHERE?!
168,3,14,Ralph,"[desperately] At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!"
169,3,14,Randy Marsh,"[drops Ralph] Come on, boys! [they all rush the store]"
170,3,14,Mrs Hollis,[looking on] This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
171,3,14,Cartman,[walks by] Excuse meh.
172,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas."
173,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?"
174,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Oh here comes the bus. [a tourist bus. Butters is behind the doors waiting to come out. The doors open and Butters exits. The bus leaves] Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
175,3,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh, conuh- [salutes] Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. [offers it]"
176,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,What battlefield?!
177,3,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see? [hands the message to Stan] Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? [Stan opens and reads the message. A Ken Burns effect sequence starts using a 19th century sepia image of Cartman as General Lee]"
178,3,14,Cartman,"Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee"
179,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[crumples the message into a ball and throws it away] God dammit, that fat piece of shit!"
180,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
181,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,That would suck so much ass.
182,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"We have to stop him, dude."
183,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?"
184,3,14,Butters Stotch,"Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch."
185,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,We'll give you 10 bucks.
186,3,14,Butters Stotch,"Oh. O-oh, okay."
187,3,14,News Reporter,"...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news, [the group's entry into Topeka is shown] a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of America. [the guy throwing the Molotov cocktail is shown] The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number. [one last attack is shown] So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern [he is shown armed], who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills."
188,3,14,Jimbo Kern,[now bloated and sluggish] Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick. [vomits] Blouach.
189,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought."
190,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed."
191,3,14,Man,[running] Aaaaa!
192,3,14,Brunet,They say you can either fight them or join them.
193,3,14,Blond,Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!
194,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[now in town] Dad, Dad. [Randy appears and stops] Mom wants you to come home."
195,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging. [a resident runs by] Get over here!"
196,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!"
197,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,"This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!"
198,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
199,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,More schnapps! [moves towards it]
200,3,14,Sgt Larsen,[the National Guard arrives] I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists.
201,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado."
202,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!"
203,3,14,Dawkins,Sir!
204,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,Fire a warning flare!
205,3,14,Dawkins,"Yes sir! [launches the flare. The flare goes up in the air, lands right on Kenny and burns him to a crisp.]"
206,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Medic! [amid the panic, a medic comes and extinguishes Kenny.]"
207,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,Woops.
208,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
209,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,You bastards!
210,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Hey!
211,3,14,Soldier,"[off camera] We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children."
212,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,Then how do we stop them?
213,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
214,3,14,Cartman,"Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle [her brows rise in surprise] on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee."
215,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home."
216,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Nice thinkin', Billy."
217,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,Let's go. [they proceed to carry the schnapps away]
218,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[enters Cartman's tent] Where to next, General?"
219,3,14,Cartman,"[with pipe in mouth] Where did the Confederates go, son?"
220,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated."
221,3,14,Cartman,"Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go."
222,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?"
223,3,14,Cartman,[turns around] Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
224,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Um, sure. [exits to get some schnapps. He lifts a case and removes the lid, but finds the case empty. He takes a second case and again finds it empty] What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?"
225,3,14,Randy Marsh,[with a guitar] We're out of s'more schnapps?
226,3,14,Mr Garrison,[checks his empty bottle] That can't be.
227,3,14,Jimbo Kern,I guess we drank it all.
228,3,14,Dawkins,Now what?
229,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave."
230,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Yeah.
231,3,14,Soldier 1,Uugh.
232,3,14,Soldier 2,Ouch.
233,3,14,Randy Marsh,"[exits his tent] Oh, my head."
234,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,Where am I?
235,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[sits next to Ned on a bench] Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had."
236,3,14,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head."
237,3,14,Mr Garrison,"[rises in his sleeping bag behind Stuart] Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today."
238,3,14,Stuart McCormick,"Me, too."
239,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[stands] Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick."
240,3,14,Cartman,[at his tent entrance] Where are you going?
241,3,14,Jimbo Kern,We're goin' home kid. Come on. [walks off]
242,3,14,Cartman,"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! [Randy stops by]"
243,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us."
244,3,14,Cartman,[watching the sober Confederates walk away] No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
245,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[rushes up with Kyle and Grandpa] Haha! You lose, fatass!"
246,3,14,Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!"
247,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history. [Cartman eyes a phone...] You see, history is forever, [...and an empty schnapps case next to it] and everything happens for a reason. [Cartman turns and walks] Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-"
248,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Where are you going?
249,3,14,Cartman,"This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! [Stan and Kyle just look at each other]"
250,3,14,Randy Marsh,Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
251,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here."
252,3,14,Stuart McCormick,"Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? [two schnapps trucks pull up and the drivers drop down. They head to the rears of the trucks and start unloading case after case of Jagermin's]"
253,3,14,Suzette,"Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl. [Cartman gets out of the truck and walks up behind her] We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need."
254,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff."
255,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,Me neither.
256,3,14,Cartman,"Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw."
257,3,14,Suzette,"Yes, please. Do a shot out of my breasts. [pours two bottles into her cleavage]"
258,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order."
259,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again! [Ned tumbles by wearing a fancy lampshade]"
260,3,14,Mr Garrison,"[rushes up] Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of ""grab ass."""
261,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,"What's ""grab ass?"""
262,3,14,Mr Garrison,You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
263,3,14,Randy Marsh,"Ey, that sounds fun. [grabs Mr. Garrison's ass]"
264,3,14,Mr Garrison,Hohoho.
265,3,14,Solders,I got you. Oo-oh. [the men laugh and chase each other around trying to grab asses here and there]
266,3,14,Cartman,"[intervenes] Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take."
267,3,14,Jimbo Kern,You heard the General.
268,3,14,Soldiers,Yeah! [all charge out. Empty schnapps cases litter the field]
269,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[reaches the scene a bit late] Oh, no."
270,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,We'll never stop them now.
271,3,14,Soldiers,Woohoo!
272,3,14,Cartman,Yes! Yes!
273,3,14,Guide,"Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action."
274,3,14,Tourist,And the Confederates won the fort?
275,3,14,Guide,"Yes. [turns and leads the group to the gates] Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you. [the group stares in awe at the seemingly thousands of Confederates just outside the gate. The guide turns to see...] Uh..."
276,3,14,Cartman,Take the fort!
277,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Charge!
278,3,14,Men,"Yeah! [they enter] Woohoo, yeah, come on!"
279,3,14,Jimbo Kern,We got it! The fort is ours! [a cannon blast knocks Randy down]
280,3,14,Randy Marsh,What was that?? [the National Guard has caught up with the Confederates and now surrounds the fort.]
281,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"[on the bullhorn] Attention political activists: you are on government historical document property! Surrender the document with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce."
282,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[takes the bullhorn] Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here."
283,3,14,Cartman,Suck my ass!
284,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"What do we do, General? We're outnumbered."
285,3,14,Cartman,We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
286,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up."
287,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there."
288,3,14,Sgt. Larsen,"Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar."
289,3,14,Elderly Voice,"Hold it right there! [The camera zooms out to show the rowdy reinforcements converge on Stan, Kyle, Grandpa, and the National Guard]"
290,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! [other men grin with joy]"
291,3,14,Cartman,I knew they would!
292,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Aw, dammit!"
293,3,14,Leader,[saluting] We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!
294,3,14,Men,Yee-haw! All right!
295,3,14,Cartman,Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
296,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! [Clinton looks out the window with two advisors]"
297,3,14,Vice President Al Gore,"Oh boy, this doesn't look good."
298,3,14,Advisor,"It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people."
299,3,14,Aide,Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists! [Clinton reads:]
300,3,14,Cartman,"Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei."
301,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands."
302,3,14,Advisor,"What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them."
303,3,14,Vice President Al Gore,"As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?"
304,3,14,President Bill Clinton,My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.
305,3,14,Aide,[salutes] Sir!
306,3,14,Vice President Al Gore,I'm so glad I don't have your job. [Clinton is surprised]
307,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves."
308,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!"
309,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?"
310,3,14,Grandpa Marvin Marsh,"Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson! [wheels away]"
311,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War."
312,3,14,Confederates,[exulting] Hooray!
313,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[to Cartman] Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei."
314,3,14,Cartman,"I don't. I made it up. [Kyle and Stan approach Clinton as Lincoln and Davis, respectively]"
315,3,14,Jimbo Kern,Hey! Who's that?!
316,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States."
317,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy."
318,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?"
319,3,14,Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?!
320,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!"
321,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering."
322,3,14,Cartman,What?!
323,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year."
324,3,14,Confederates,Wow!
325,3,14,Randy Marsh,A whole year?
326,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted."
327,3,14,President Bill Clinton,That's it? I-I don't have to sign this thing? [Kyle and Stan turn to each other and shake hands]
328,3,14,Gerald Broflovski,"Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back."
329,3,14,Cartman,No! We still have to fight!
330,3,14,Jimbo Kern,"[stops] Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over."
331,3,14,Cartman,NOOO!!
332,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"[walks over with Kyle] It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!"
333,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! [tugs at it until it pulls off]
334,3,14,Cartman,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- [the camera zooms out for a view of the city, then the planet, then the Milky Way, then the binary-star system of Marklar, the Marklar themselves, then another planet, then the Visitors are seen...] -AAAH!"
335,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"[walks up and genuflects behind Stan and Kyle, patting each of them on the shoulder] Boys, as President of the United States, I want to commend you for stopping the rebel uprising."
336,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Don't touch me. [Clinton stands up]
337,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!"
338,3,14,Cartman,"Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit!"
339,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-"
340,3,14,Cartman,Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
341,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,What??
342,3,14,Cartman,The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
343,3,14,President Bill Clinton,"Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War."
344,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,Awwww!
345,3,14,Cartman,Hahahaha haa ha!
346,3,14,Stan Marsh/President Jefferson Davis,"Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home. [he and Kyle walk away with Grandpa] Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!"
347,3,14,Kyle Broflovski/President Abraham Lincoln,"Yeah. Thanks, dick!"
