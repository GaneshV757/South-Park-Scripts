0,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Mom, please can we just leave?"
1,3,3,Liane Cartman,"You have to see the eye doctor, Eric."
2,3,3,Eric Cartman,But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
3,3,3,Liane Cartman,"You're not fat, you're big-boned."
4,3,3,Eric Cartman,"That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason."
5,3,3,Doctor s assistant,"[at the door, flatly] Eric Cartman. [a poster behind her looks like her]"
6,3,3,Eric Cartman,[enters the examination room] Weak. [the assistant follows him in to close the door.]
7,3,3,Optometrist,"Hello, Eric."
8,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[resigned] Hi, Doctor Lout."
9,3,3,Dr Lott,How's my little piggy today?
10,3,3,Eric Cartman,[points his finger at him] Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
11,3,3,Dr Lott,I just say that because you're my little buddy.
12,3,3,Eric Cartman,"I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!"
13,3,3,Dr Lott,Hop up on the chair. [Cartman hops up] Don't break it now!
14,3,3,Eric Cartman,[turns around and sits] God damn it!
15,3,3,Dr Lott,Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing. [lowering a refractor to Cartman's eyes] All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
16,3,3,Eric Cartman,Yes.
17,3,3,Dr Lott,"All right, read them out for me."
18,3,3,Eric Cartman,I am a little piggy. Ey! [the optometrist laughs. Cartman stands up on the chair and pushes the refractor away.] That does it! Mom!
19,3,3,Dr Lott,"No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence. [voice fades as he removes the card from the refractor] I do not know how that happened. [reads the card] ""I am a little piggy."" Wow! What are the odds of that? [throws it away] All right, let's get down to business, shall we? [places the refractor back on Cartman's face.]"
20,3,3,Eric Cartman,Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
21,3,3,Dr Lott,"[begins to calibrate] Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?"
22,3,3,Eric Cartman,They look exactly the same.
23,3,3,Dr Lott,Just pick one. Or two.
24,3,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, two!"
25,3,3,Dr Lott,"[flips between two women] Okay. One, or two? One, or two?"
26,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh, one."
27,3,3,Dr Lott,"[flips between an apple and a tall slice of chocolate cake] One, or two? One, or two?"
28,3,3,Eric Cartman,[chooses the cake] Two.
29,3,3,Dr Lott,"No! The answer is one, piggy! One! [hits Cartman through the refractor]"
30,3,3,Eric Cartman,Ow! I hate you!
31,3,3,Dr Lott,"[removes the refractor] Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests."
32,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
33,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch."
34,3,3,Kenny McCormick,Maybe he took a dump and got sick. [the others laugh]
35,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [sees Cartman] Oh, here he comes."
36,3,3,Eric Cartman,[with very dilated pupils] Hey dudes.
37,3,3,Stan Marsh,"[squints hard for a better look] Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? [Kyle blinks hard]"
38,3,3,Eric Cartman,My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
39,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
40,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!"
41,3,3,Stan Marsh,Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
42,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do."
43,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do."
44,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, yeah! [The four enter the kitchen, but Cartman runs into the entrance and falls on his way in.] Ow!"
45,3,3,The Boys,Hey Chef!
46,3,3,Mr Derp,"[wearing a hairnet and cook's cap] Hello there, children."
47,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[rubs his eyes] Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy."
48,3,3,Mr Derp,It's time for lunch-e-roo.
49,3,3,Stan Marsh,Where's Chef?
50,3,3,Mr Derp,Chef quit.
51,3,3,The Boys,What?!
52,3,3,Mr Derp,"Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp. [ta-daaa!]"
53,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Derp?
54,3,3,Mr Derp,"When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp. [ta-daaa! Mr. Derp hits himself with a hammer and toddles] Ooo! Derp! [falls to the floor, then gets up] Derp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids? [laughs, but the boys aren't impressed]"
55,3,3,Stan Marsh,Why did Chef quit?
56,3,3,Mr Derp,"Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone. [takes out a tiny cannon and shoots himself with it. His face is full of gunpowder] Oh, I don't feel so good. [laughs] Derp!"
57,3,3,Stan Marsh,[after a moment of silence] Could you just hand us some food please?
58,3,3,Mr Derp,"Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!"
59,3,3,Eric Cartman,Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
60,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
61,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back."
62,3,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. [chuckles]"
63,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks back] Shut up, Cartman!"
64,3,3,Eric Cartman,[runs into the door] Ow!
65,3,3,Chef,"[wrapped in a lavender towel, opens the door] Oh! Hello there, children!"
66,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today."
67,3,3,Chef,Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
68,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but we didn't believe them."
69,3,3,Chef,"Well, it's true."
70,3,3,Stan Marsh,But why? Why would you quit?
71,3,3,Chef,"Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off."
72,3,3,Stan Marsh,So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
73,3,3,Chef,"No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked."
74,3,3,Stan Marsh,Talked?!
75,3,3,Chef,"Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself."
76,3,3,Woman,[walks up and looks out] Oh! What darling little children.
77,3,3,Chef,"Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica."
78,3,3,Stan Marsh,"[ignoring that statement] That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!"
79,3,3,Chef,"Children, Veronica is moving in with me."
80,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Moving in?!
81,3,3,Chef,I'm in love.
82,3,3,Boys,Love?!
83,3,3,Veronica,"Oh, you knight. [cuddles Chef]"
84,3,3,Stan Marsh,What the hell is going on?!
85,3,3,Chef,Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
86,3,3,Veronica,"[teasing] Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you."
87,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better."
88,3,3,Chef,"Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too."
89,3,3,Veronica,What's the problem?
90,3,3,Eric Cartman,"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean."
91,3,3,Veronica,"Oh, I know just the song for you.
[reaches behind the door and pulls out a guitar. She starts to play it]
There's got to be a morning after
if we can hold on to the night
[the boys are shocked, and Kenny pulls his hood tight]"
92,3,3,Chef,[blandly] We have a chance to find the sunshine.
93,3,3,Chef,
94,3,3,Veronica,
95,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"This... is insane. [""Oh, can't you see the-""]"
96,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,That bitch!
97,3,3,Stan Marsh,She's stealing Chef from us.
98,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,She didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
99,3,3,Eric Cartman,Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
100,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Wait you guys. [pensive] Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? [the others think about it...]"
101,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, so?"
102,3,3,Stan Marsh,"...Yeah, screw that bitch."
103,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Bitch, I hate that bitch!"
104,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around."
105,3,3,Stan Marsh,Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
106,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Good idea.
107,3,3,Dr Lott,"All right, we got the test results back, piggy-"
108,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[sits on the chair, his pupils normal again] Stop calling me piggy!"
109,3,3,Dr Lott,You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
110,3,3,Eric Cartman,"So, what does that mean?"
111,3,3,Dr Lott,"It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better."
112,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[seething] All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair [throws a fit] and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!"
113,3,3,Dr Lott,"Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. [puts a pair of blocky glasses on Cartman]"
114,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[after seeing how they look and fit] Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me."
115,3,3,Dr Lott,"I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses."
116,3,3,Eric Cartman,I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
117,3,3,Dr Lott,That's why we have the little stapler. [takes it out and starts stapling the glasses to Cartman's head]
118,3,3,Eric Cartman,Ow! Son of a bitch!
119,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,They said that Chef works in one of these buildings [the boys run into Cartman in front of Steinburg & Burgstein Accounting.
120,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey dudes. [the others study him, then laugh. Cartman is hurt, but jabs] Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!"
121,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Just take them off!
122,3,3,Eric Cartman,"I can't! They're stapled to my head! [they study him again, then laugh harder.] I hate you guys."
123,3,3,Receptionist,Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
124,3,3,Stan Marsh,We wanna talk to Chef.
125,3,3,Receptionist,Chef?
126,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"He's a big guy, with a beard."
127,3,3,Stan Marsh,And a chef hat.
128,3,3,Kenny McCormick,(And a real huge dick.)
129,3,3,Receptionist,Oh! The black guy!
130,3,3,Stan Marsh,Huh?
131,3,3,Receptionist,"Third cubicle on the left [directs them to the work area, where Chef's hat can be seen, but stops Cartman] Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?"
132,3,3,Eric Cartman,"[dismissively] Uh, yeah, sure sure."
133,3,3,Receptionist,Wow! You really got fat.
134,3,3,Eric Cartman,Ey!
135,3,3,Chef,"Hello there, children."
136,3,3,Hey,Dialog
137,3,3,Chef,Dialog
138,3,3,Chef,"Eric, you got glasses!"
139,3,3,Stan Marsh,"Chef, you have to dump the bitch!"
140,3,3,Chef,Huh?
141,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We need you, Chef."
142,3,3,Man,"[pops up from another cubicle] Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?"
143,3,3,Chef,You bet! [the guy grins]
144,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, this place isn't you!"
145,3,3,Chef,"Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old."
146,3,3,Stan Marsh,But we don't like her.
147,3,3,Chef,Why not??
148,3,3,Stan Marsh,I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
149,3,3,Chef,"Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day."
150,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No way, dude!"
151,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses."
152,3,3,Chef,That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
153,3,3,Eric Cartman,Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
154,3,3,Chef,You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
155,3,3,Kids,Okay!
156,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,Chef should be here any minute.
157,3,3,Stan Marsh,[pissed] Dude! He bailed on us!
158,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,[pissed] I can't believe it!
159,3,3,Stan Marsh,Come on! We're going to his house! [they leave the bus stop]
160,3,3,Chef,"Oh! Uh, hello there, children."
161,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!"
162,3,3,Chef,"Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot."
163,3,3,Stan Marsh,[sarcastic] You forgot!
164,3,3,Chef,Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner. [dreamy] She's so amazing.
165,3,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!"
166,3,3,Veronica,"[appears behind Chef] Hello, children!"
167,3,3,Eric Cartman,"Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?"
168,3,3,Chef,"Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. [a dramatic riff signals the boys' alarm]"
169,3,3,Stan Marsh,Oh no! No nononononono!
170,3,3,Chef,"My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too."
