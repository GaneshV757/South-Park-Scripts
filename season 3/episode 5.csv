0,3,5,Voice,"[male] This is shop class. [it belongs to a heavyset man, who stands next to a chalkboard, pointing to the information] My name is Mr. Adler. For the next week, rather than your normal schoolwork, you'll be learning how to make things. Now, does anybody know WHY you're in shop class? [Stan raises his hand] Yes?"
1,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?"
2,3,5,Mr Adler,"Wrong! You are here because you are America's future! [stirring music plays] You may someday be doctors, or lawyers, or scientists. Most of you, however, will be pumping gas, or cutting sheet metal, and that's why we have... [points to the words] shop class."
3,3,5,Eric Cartman,Ooooohh.
4,3,5,Mr Adler,"Now, let me make one thing crystal clear: I don't like kids that screw around! You screw around in shop class, you can lose a hand or an eye. I have a- [picks up a picture of a his fiancée and begins to get lost looking at it] I have... uh, I have a..."
5,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Adler?
6,3,5,Mr Adler,"[sets the picture down] Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?"
7,3,5,Stan Marsh,[quickly points] Tweek is!
8,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Arrh! No, I'm not!"
9,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble."
10,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Arrrrh!
11,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class."
12,3,5,Mr Adler,"That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?"
13,3,5,Craig Tucker,No.
14,3,5,Mr Adler,"Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we- [Craig flips him off] Hey! Did you just flip me off?!"
15,3,5,Craig Tucker,No.
16,3,5,Mr Adler,"Yes, you did!"
17,3,5,Eric Cartman,Told ya!
18,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[hushed, to Stan] Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec."
19,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls."
20,3,5,Voice,"[female] Welcome to home ec. [the camera scans across the class] For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty. [Kenny appears]"
21,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Woohooo!) [Wendy raises her hand]
22,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,"I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here."
23,3,5,Woman,"That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers. [now cautioning] But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec."
24,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Woohooo!) [the girls on either side of him look at him]
25,3,5,Eric Cartman,I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? [cuts out two slabs]
26,3,5,Stan Marsh,I don't know. He's such a wuss.
27,3,5,Mr Adler,[passing by] Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
28,3,5,Eric Cartman,"You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. [Craig leafs through some wood scraps, and Tweek approaches a belt sander on the floor]"
29,3,5,Stan Marsh,No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
30,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass."
31,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Do you wanna bet?
32,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'll bet."
33,3,5,Stan Marsh,How much?
34,3,5,Eric Cartman,Five bucks.
35,3,5,Stan Marsh,You're on!
36,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[revs up a belt sander.] Arrh!  [jumps. Stan and Kyle walk to him]
37,3,5,Stan Marsh,Hey Tweek.
38,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[jumps] Gaarhrhrh!
39,3,5,Stan Marsh,Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
40,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[drops the sander] He does?
41,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?"
42,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Why?
43,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? [Craig is still leafing through the scraps]"
44,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[jumps] Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
45,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Craig, could I talk to you real quick? [Craig flips him off, and Cartman puts his palms up to calm him] Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater."
46,3,5,Craig Tucker,He did?
47,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it."
48,3,5,Craig Tucker,Why would he say that?
49,3,5,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you."
50,3,5,Craig Tucker,"[now pissed] Well, I've gotta go over there and-"
51,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[blocks his way] No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today."
52,3,5,Craig Tucker,Okay. [flips Tweek off]
53,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
54,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[twitches to one side] Rrrr! What a jerk!
55,3,5,Stan Marsh,"He's really got it out for you, dude."
56,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Why?! What did I do?!
57,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"So, do you agree to fight him after school?"
58,3,5,Tweek Tweak,I guess so.
59,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Super. See you there. [they walk away, pleased]"
60,3,5,Fianc e,"[runs from him] Catch me, Richard. [she laughs even after he catches her and she's on the grass] I'm so in love with you, Richard. [next scene: she's in the kitchen holding a tray] I made you some cookies, Richard. [sniffs them real good. Next, she's by the fireplace with a little stocking] Merry Christmas, Richard. [laughing on the yard outside] Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. [in flight, trying to regain control] Aaaaaaa! [in a swimming pool, under water] Richard!"
61,3,5,Mr Adler,"Aaaarr! Uh. [opens a drawer to get some nicotine gum, and chews some] Oh why? Why? [closes his eyes and continues chewing]"
62,3,5,Stan Marsh,Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
63,3,5,Mr Adler,[opens his eyes] Huh? Stop screwing around!
64,3,5,Stan Marsh,The bell rang. Can we go?
65,3,5,Mr Adler,"Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed."
66,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Cartman follow him out.]"
67,3,5,Stan Marsh,"This is gonna be so sweet, dude."
68,3,5,Eric Cartman,You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
69,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,We'll see!
70,3,5,Eric Cartman,Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
71,3,5,Stan Marsh,"You're on, fatass! [Kenny shows up]"
72,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!"
73,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)"
74,3,5,Stan Marsh,"How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?"
75,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. That's not cool, dude. [the girls walk by]"
76,3,5,Bebe Stevens,"Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow."
77,3,5,Annie Knitts,"Bye, Kenny."
78,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Bye, ladies.) [the other boys arrive as the girls leave]"
79,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"Hey, what's going on?"
80,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
81,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"Really? Cool. [the boys stand around waiting] It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago."
82,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
83,3,5,Token Black,"Yeah, they left."
84,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw, hell!"
85,3,5,Eric Cartman,Those sons of bitches!
86,3,5,Clyde Donovan,I guess they don't wanna fight.
87,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! [walks off with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny]"
88,3,5,Stan Marsh,Tweek?
89,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,[looks up to the second floor] Tweek?
90,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[opens the center window] Arrh! What do you guys want?
91,3,5,Stan Marsh,"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!"
92,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
93,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Craig showed up."
94,3,5,Tweek Tweak,He did?
95,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"""
96,3,5,Tweek Tweak,I don't have crooked teeth!
97,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken; [Stan watches as Kyle demonstrates] well, everybody in the world saw it!"
98,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Everyone in the world?! Rrrr! [falls down behind the window]
99,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it was weak."
100,3,5,Tweek Tweak,I'm not a chicken!
101,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. [turns to walk away]"
102,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[pops up] Wait! I'll fight!
103,3,5,Stan Marsh,Tomorrow?
104,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Okay.
105,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!"
106,3,5,Craig Tucker,Red Racer's on.
107,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!"
108,3,5,Craig Tucker,I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
109,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[aloof] Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom."
110,3,5,Craig Tucker,Nope. [shuts the door]
111,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[hushed] Egh. God damn it! [knocks again, and Craig answers] Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig."
112,3,5,Craig Tucker,What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
113,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed."
114,3,5,Craig Tucker,"That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!"
115,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?"
116,3,5,Craig Tucker,After Red Racer.
117,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[being gracious] After Red Racer, of course."
118,3,5,Richard Tweak,"How was school today, son?"
119,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Errh!
120,3,5,Richard Tweak,That's great.
121,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??"
122,3,5,Richard Tweak,"Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met. [gets up and stands next to her. Peaceful music plays] You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive."
123,3,5,Mrs Tweak,It's true. I was. [Tweek bobs as he listens]
124,3,5,Richard Tweak,"Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight. [sits down, and both parent resume eating. Tweek waits for the rest of the story.]"
125,3,5,Tweek Tweak,[after a long lull] Well?
126,3,5,Mrs Tweak,"Well what, honey?"
127,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Nrr. What happened?
128,3,5,Richard Tweak,"Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something."
129,3,5,Mrs Tweak,"Yes, I think that's right."
130,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Rrrrr! You guys never help me! [the parents look at each other, and Tweek starts banging his head against the table] Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! [the parents resume eating]"
131,3,5,Craig Tucker,"Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow."
132,3,5,Thomas Tucker,With who?
133,3,5,Craig Tucker,Some kid.
134,3,5,Thomas Tucker,Oh.
135,3,5,Laura Tucker,"Don't just ""Oh"" him, Thomas!"
136,3,5,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me!"
137,3,5,Thomas Tucker,"I'll ""Oh"" whoever I want! [Mrs. Tucker flips Thomas off, he flips back, the daughter flips them both off, and Craig flips his dad off with the right hand, his sister off with the left, and his mom with the right, up close.]"
138,3,5,Mr Adler,"Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later."
139,3,5,Pearl,"Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?"
140,3,5,Mr Adler,Why?
141,3,5,Pearl,"Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight."
142,3,5,Mr Adler,"Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on."
143,3,5,Pearl,"Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?"
144,3,5,Mr Adler,"I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. [he begins closing the door]"
145,3,5,Pearl,We'll use plastic wrap.
146,3,5,Mr Adler,"Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time. [shuts the door on her face. He holds the door in place, then makes his way to a picture of his deceased love, picks it up, and remembers...]"
147,3,5,Fianc e,"[on a swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard. [now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over] Smile. [now opens a little box and sees a ring] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do! [in flight, trying to regain control] Aaaaaaa! [in a swimming pool, under water] Richard! [now rising from an open coffin] Richard."
148,3,5,Mr Adler,"[returns] Haaarrr! [opens a small drawer in the side table, gets some nicotine gum, and starts chewing, then mumbles] Aw, God, what am I gonna do? [resumes chewing]"
149,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45."
150,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?"
151,3,5,Craig Tucker,I uh...
152,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[covers Craig's mouth] However long Craig wants it to last. [the kids laugh] T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge."
153,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
154,3,5,Eric Cartman,Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
155,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, fatass!!"
156,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! [jumps on him, and they start fighting. Kenny and Stan soon join in, leaving Tweek and Craig looking at them]"
157,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight."
158,3,5,Pearl,"[stands by a chart equating shoes with money] On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes. [Kenny and the girls take notes. Pearl then stands by the chalkboard listing the number of credit cards from 1 to 4] When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE. [crosses 1 out] It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy. [crosses 4 out] The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two. [circles it. Bebe raises her hand]"
159,3,5,Bebe Stevens,"What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?"
160,3,5,Pearl,Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats. [the girls and Kenny just look at her]
161,3,5,Eric Cartman,"When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world."
162,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!"
163,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000."
164,3,5,Mr Adler,"Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! [He now hears a voice calling to him, from the drawers in his desk...]"
165,3,5,Fianc e,"Ri-chard! [he whistles] Ri-chard! [he remembers mumbling something in return, and pulls out her picture. He dreams: she is back on the swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher![now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over. Cut to her opening a little box] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! [in the cockpit, she calls out] It's all for you! [an alarm sounds, and the gas tank explodes behind her] Aaaaaaa! [she tries to land the plane right, but it falls into a swimming pool. She's thrown clear, into the water] Richard!"
166,3,5,Clyde Donovan,Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
167,3,5,Mr Adler,"[returns] Huh? Uh, what?"
168,3,5,Clyde Donovan,Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander [Tommy comes and stands beside Clyde. There are no features on his face.]
169,3,5,Mr Adler,"The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I? [Clyde looks at Tommy for a reaction, but...] Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. [Tommy walks away in the wrong direction]"
170,3,5,Clyde Donovan,[noticing the picture and points] What's that?
171,3,5,Mr Adler,"Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago."
172,3,5,Clyde Donovan,What? She die or something?
173,3,5,Mr Adler,"What? Hey! Go on! [upset, he puts the picture away] You're screwing around in here! [Clyde hurries away]"
174,3,5,Clyde Donovan,Oh boy! Here we go!
175,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,[joins the group] What's happening?
176,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
177,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,Oh cool!
178,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed. [the two groups meet] All right. Here we go."
179,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy."
180,3,5,Eric Cartman,"You're gonna be eating those words, asshole."
181,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. [Craig and Tweek look at each other, but nothing happens]"
182,3,5,Stan Marsh,Well?
183,3,5,Eric Cartman,Come on!
184,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!"
185,3,5,Craig Tucker,[turns to the crowd] What do we do?
186,3,5,Stan Marsh,Huh?
187,3,5,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other."
188,3,5,Tweek Tweak,How?
189,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,How??
190,3,5,Craig Tucker,I've never been in a fight before.
191,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Me neither.
192,3,5,Crowd,[let down] Awwww.
193,3,5,Stan Marsh,"[in disgust] Aw, dude, come on!!"
194,3,5,Eric Cartman,"You just hit each other, smack each other around. [Tweek slaps Craig, and Craig slaps Tweek. No effect]"
195,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,[sighs] Not like that!
196,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Like what, then?"
197,3,5,Stan Marsh,"[approaches the fighters] All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight."
198,3,5,Crowd,Awww. [disperses]
199,3,5,Clyde Donovan,[to Wendy] All that build-up for nothing.
200,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!"
201,3,5,Stan Marsh,"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig."
202,3,5,Eric Cartman,"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek."
203,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!"
204,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[faking fear] Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys! [serious] I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!"
205,3,5,Stan Marsh,Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
206,3,5,Eric Cartman,Fine! [the parties part ways]
207,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Fine!
208,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Fine, that's fine!"
209,3,5,Jimbo,"Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing."
210,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrrrh!
211,3,5,Jimbo,You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
212,3,5,Ned,Mmrr I can still kick ass.
213,3,5,Jimbo,"Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you."
214,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Hwaaah! [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]
215,3,5,Jimbo,"Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. [rings the bell, and Ned sends Tweek to the ropes with one punch]"
216,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Uugh!
217,3,5,Ned,"Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch? [Tweek gets up]"
218,3,5,Jimbo,"Keep your guard up, Tweek! [Tweek does so. Ned punches him twice more, and Tweek falls]"
219,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Ow!
220,3,5,Stan Marsh,Damn it!
221,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!"
222,3,5,Jimbo,"All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. [Tweek gets up]"
223,3,5,Ned,"[prancing] Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch?"
224,3,5,Jimbo,"Punch him in the balls, Tweek!! [Tweek lunges at Ned and lands the punch]"
225,3,5,Ned,AAAAaaaarrgh.
226,3,5,Jimbo,"Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! [Tweek lands a barrage of punches, and Ned groans after each punch]"
227,3,5,Ned,Ow.
228,3,5,Jimbo,"Good! Now kick his balls! [Tweek does so several times, and Ned groans] There, see? You've got him coughing up blood."
229,3,5,Stan Marsh,Hooray!
230,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Hooray!
231,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrrr!
232,3,5,Jimbo,Now THAT'S BOXING!
233,3,5,Master,"Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect. [Craig flips him off] In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf."
234,3,5,Craig Tucker,Meatloaf?
235,3,5,Master,The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
236,3,5,Eric Cartman,"I'm ready! [comes out, speaks softly] Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. [stops to pull some salt out of a kettle and pats his hands together]"
237,3,5,Master,"Let us begin. [Cartman plants his feet] Ready? And, th-ree."
238,3,5,Eric Cartman,Respect my authoritah! [he and Craig engage in pushing each other]
239,3,5,Master,Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
240,3,5,Eric Cartman,"[turns around to back Craig out of the ring] Dude. Come on, now. Come on."
241,3,5,Craig Tucker,"Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!"
242,3,5,Master,Fight back! Resist the ass!
243,3,5,Craig Tucker,How can I resist an ass so great?
244,3,5,Master,It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.
245,3,5,Craig Tucker,"This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. [Cartman bumps him off the ring, he hits a wall, and he's out]"
246,3,5,Eric Cartman,I win!
247,3,5,Master,"There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession."
248,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey, maybe. [plants his feet again]"
249,3,5,Mr Adler,[twisting and turning] No. No. Make it stop.
250,3,5,Fianc e,"[laughing on the yard outside] Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot! [in the cockpit during flight] Watch me, Richard! [waves to him as she writes ""I love U Richard."" As she gets to the last letters, she loses control and the alarm comes on. Her gas tank explodes and she screams. She manages to write A's on her way down to a crash in the pool. She sinks and calls out] Richard!"
251,3,5,Mr Adler,"Baaaaa! [looks around and then sobs] I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye! [reaches for some nicotine gum, only to find the box empty] Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! [begins bawling]"
252,3,5,Pearl,"Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together. [holds up a board saying] Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"
253,3,5,Class,"[including Kenny] Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?"
254,3,5,Pearl,"All right, now let's try this one together. [holds up a board saying] Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car...."
255,3,5,Class,[including Kenny] Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
256,3,5,Pearl,"Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one. [holds up a board saying] I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life."
257,3,5,Bebe Stevens,I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
258,3,5,Pearl,"Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try? [holds up a board saying] I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed."
259,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
260,3,5,Pearl,"[looks at him in dismay] O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick?"
261,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Sure you can.) [gets up and goes to her desk]
262,3,5,Pearl,"Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you."
263,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Why?)
264,3,5,Pearl,"Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good."
265,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(You don't?)
266,3,5,Pearl,No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.
267,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Shop class?) [images of threatening tools tools fill his head: a drill, a torch, a belt sander, a table saw] (No, I won't!)"
268,3,5,Pearl,"Now, now. Very few students are severely injured in a shop class."
269,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(I don't wanna take shop class!) [draws his hood tight, and the bell rings]"
270,3,5,Bebe Stevens,Come on! It's time for the fight!
271,3,5,Wendy Testaburger,Yeah! [the girls begin to file out of class]
272,3,5,Pearl,"Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?"
273,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Okay, the time has finally come. [the other kids close in]"
274,3,5,Clyde Donovan,"[holding a box of] Programs, get your programs here. Programs."
275,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low."
276,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Hrrr.
277,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek."
278,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Rrrr, mean, rrrr."
279,3,5,Eric Cartman,The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
280,3,5,Craig Tucker,Okay.
281,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!"
282,3,5,Craig Tucker,"Okay, okay!"
283,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrrr! [Craig adjusts his own head] Hr. [Craig flips him off]
284,3,5,Stan Marsh,You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
285,3,5,Craig Tucker,Respect my authority.
286,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Tweek!"
287,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Tweek!"
288,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Craig!"
289,3,5,Mr Adler,"Good-bye, cruel world. [sits up] Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! [lie back down, now head first]"
290,3,5,Stan Marsh,Ye-hah!
291,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! [the fighters, now tired and panting, butt heads]"
292,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!"
293,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, Craig!"
294,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
295,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Get him! [the fighters just pant, stuck to each other] Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?"
296,3,5,Tweek Tweak,What?
297,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,Craig just called you a boner!
298,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrrr! [punches Craig]
299,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,[to Stan:] We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
300,3,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
301,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Hi, Mr. Adler.)"
302,3,5,Mr Adler,"What? Who are you? [takes the note and reads] ""Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class."" Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there. [hands him back the note and Kenny goes to the jigsaw] Hrh."
303,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"[gets up] Huh? [Craig pops up and tackles Tweek. The other kids, fearing the fight over, cheer again.]"
304,3,5,Mr Adler,[sits up] What the-? [the door opens and the other kids pour in]
305,3,5,Stan Marsh,Here they are.
306,3,5,Mr Adler,[stands and walks towards the kids] Hey! What's going on?
307,3,5,Stan Marsh,Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. [trading punches]
308,3,5,Mr Adler,"Well, why the hell don't you stop them?"
309,3,5,Eric Cartman,'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
310,3,5,Mr Adler,Don't screw aROUND![Craig and Tweek tumble towards Kenny]
311,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Hey!) [They knock the stool out under him. He hangs on to the jigsaw table] (Hey!)
312,3,5,Mr Adler,"Stop screwin' aROUND!![Tweek slams Craig into a second jigsaw and both tumble into a tool cart, which falls onto the second jigsaw, which tumbles onto the one Kenny is on.]"
313,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, God damn it!)"
314,3,5,Mr Adler,"Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!! [Kenny gets stuck in the blade and spins around. He's finally thrown clear and ends up in a box of old nails. Some nails fly out of the box.]"
315,3,5,Kenny McCormick,(Ugh!)
316,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
317,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
318,3,5,Mr Adler,"[goes to the box of nails and plucks Kenny out] Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance! [the boys just shrug] You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?"
319,3,5,Kenny McCormick,"(I understand, dude.)"
320,3,5,Mr Adler,"What? What's that, son?"
321,3,5,Fianc e,[through Kenny] Richard.
322,3,5,Mr Adler,"AAaaagh! [settles down] No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Stan shrugs]"
323,3,5,Fianc e,"[visible now, where Kenny's face was] Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy."
324,3,5,Mr Adler,But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
325,3,5,Fianc e,"Then say it now, Richard."
326,3,5,Mr Adler,Good-bye?
327,3,5,Fianc e,There. Now do you feel better?
328,3,5,Mr Adler,No.
329,3,5,Fianc e,"Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it."
330,3,5,Mr Adler,You... you're right. You're right. [The fiancée leaves and an old woman takes her place. The background is blue.]
331,3,5,Woman,"Richard, this is Grandma."
332,3,5,Mr Adler,"Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!"
333,3,5,Gram ma,You never said good-bye to me either. [she leaves and a man enters]
334,3,5,Man,"Hey, Richard. Remember me?"
335,3,5,Mr Adler,"Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!"
336,3,5,Mr. Adler's Uncle Corey,[gleefully] No! We're dead! [leaves]
337,3,5,Fianc e,"[returns] I love you, Richard. See you soon."
338,3,5,Mr Adler,"Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive. [holds Kenny close] Thank you, baby. Thank you."
339,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
340,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig."
341,3,5,Nurse,"Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up. [leads the way. The kids follow and are let in. Craig and Tweek are in adjacent beds recovering from their injuries.]"
342,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?"
343,3,5,Tweek Tweak,Rrr!
344,3,5,Craig Tucker,Ugh.
345,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you."
346,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. [Craig flips them off]"
347,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad."
348,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Boy, do we ever."
349,3,5,Stan Marsh,"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. [the group turns towards the door]"
350,3,5,Tweek Tweak,What?!
351,3,5,Craig Tucker,What?!
352,3,5,Stan Marsh,"[the group turns back to the beds] Well, I mean, that's what was on the news."
353,3,5,Craig Tucker,What was on the news?
354,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig."
355,3,5,Craig Tucker,Huh?
356,3,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters."
357,3,5,Tweek Tweak,"Uuh! You son of a bitch! [pounces on Craig, and the fighting starts again, leaving the room a mess]"
358,3,5,Craig Tucker,I'm gonna kick your ass!
359,3,5,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Tweek! You got him!"
360,3,5,Eric Cartman,"Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!"
