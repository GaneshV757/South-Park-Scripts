9,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Hey babe, what's up? [he looks at her, his grin turns into a frown, and his bright eyes glaze over and close halfway]"
10,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[flatly] Oh, hey babe, what's goin' on?"
11,21,1,Heidi Turner,What are you doing?
12,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Nnnothing, I'm just having fun with my friends. Is that, is that okay? [Heidi's smile vanishes]"
13,21,1,Heidi Turner,What are you pissed off about?
14,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out."
15,21,1,Heidi Turner,[a bit annoyed] So you're just gonna be passive-aggressive again and not talk about what you're feeling?
16,21,1,Stan Marsh,"Uhwell, I think uhh, I think I got some stuff to do at home. [the boys start to leave as one]"
17,21,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yup. Uhh, come on, Ike."

20,21,1,Jimmy Valmer,"W-we'll see you later, man. G-g'm, good luck. [closes the door. Cartman look at the door with his jaw dropped]"
21,21,1,Eric Cartman,[sigh] Awesome. Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys.
22,21,1,Heidi Turner,[walks up to Cartman] You were clearly mad about something. You should just tell me when you're mad.
23,21,1,Eric Cartman,Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day.
24,21,1,Heidi Turner,Why do you act like this all the time?
25,21,1,Eric Cartman,Uuugh. [leans away]
26,21,1,Heidi Turner,"You were the one who was pissed off, you're the one being passive-aggressive again!"
27,21,1,Eric Cartman,Uuugh! [droops as if being weighed down by a ship's anchor]
28,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Because you don't know how to talk about how you're feeling! [walks out the front door, slamming it shut. Cartman is still drooping, then he sighs.]"
29,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, add ""titty chips"" to my shopping list."
30,21,1,Alexa,"I've added ""titty chips"" to your shopping list. [Cartman laughs softly, but heartily]"
31,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Look at 'em. Every day, people are buyin' more an' more of them Amazon and Google thingies while we all sit here an' [pounds on the bar counter with his left fist] lose our jobs!"
32,21,1,Eddie,It ain't right.
33,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Automated personal assistants, self-drivin' trucks, whatever happened to people jobs?!"
34,21,1,Cleetus,They took our jobs! [the other rednecks join him in protest]
35,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[stands on a table] They took our jubs! And it's time for us to band together and take to the streets to say ""We ain't gonna take it no more!"" [the other rednecks resume the protest and a couple of Confederate flags pop up and are swung side to side] Now let's get out there and protest that Alexa took our jobs!"
36,21,1,Alexa,"Now playing ""Turk Our Durr"" by Joni Mitchell. [a mangled version of ""Help Me"" plays]"
37,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"No, not Joni Mitchell - ""Turk Our Durr"", you took our durbs!"
38,21,1,Randy Marsh,"There's been a lot of hurting in our country lately. [Walks towards the camera] You can either be part of the solution, or part of the problem. [moves to his right as Sharon walks into view] A few months ago my wife Sharon and I [wraps his left arm around her left shoulder] decided to be part of the solution... [a horizontal flip and Randy and Sharon now stand in front of a house. Randy is now wearing a tool belt full of tools. The camera zooms out and up and away] by remodeling and flipping houses for people all over our town! [the opening credits roll: a shot of houses passing by, then of an interior before and after remodeling into a dining room] Flipping houses is fun, but never easy. [Randy takes a sledgehammer to an interior wall] We enjoy turning people's dreams into reality. [a large traditional kitchen with an interior wall separating it from the dining room is transformed into an open kitchen with cooking island and breakfast nook]"
39,21,1,Sharon Marsh,"I'm Sharon Marsh and I do the designing and decorating. [shots of her showing Randy the new blinds in a kitchen, hanging up a Live, Laugh, Love framed poster, and taking notes on what to change next]"
40,21,1,Randy Marsh,And I'm her husband Randy. I do the construction and practice MMA in my spare time. [a shot of him punching away at a cylindrical punching bag. He stops and grins at the camera]
41,21,1,Sharon Marsh,"We renovated over 45 homes [a dining room and kitchen are soon joined into a kitchen with more open space] in Park County, Colorado. [a wall between one kitchen and the living room is transformed into bar space with a renovated kitchen behind it]"
42,21,1,Randy Marsh,[talking to a couple behind him in their kitchen] What we're thinking is to take out the wall between the kitchen and living room for a more open concept.
43,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[narrating] Our job is to deliver the maximum wow factor for the least amount of budget. [at a different house, Randy whacks away at a floor-to-ceiling storage unit. At yet another house Randy demolished a brick oven. At another he shatters a ceiling: ""Oh, Jesus."" At another he destroys a wall between a kitchen and dining room] there's never a dull moment."
44,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[with Sharon, and a couple with blindfolds on] So guys, are you ready to see your renovation?!"
45,21,1,Randy Marsh,[narrating] On White People Renovating Houses.
46,21,1,Randy Marsh,[narrating] Janet and Dave Fitzsimmons are looking to move from their dated two-story colonial home.
47,21,1,Randy Marsh,"What we're thinking here is taking out the wall between the kitchen and living room to give you an ""open concept"". Then we'll give you lots of space to entertain with an updated kitchen island and bar stool. [the rednecks march past the house] With... [annoyed] What the hell is that?"
48,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us! [Randy and Sharon look out the window at the protesters]
49,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Amazon!
50,21,1,Protesters,You took our jobs!
51,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Google! Apple!
52,21,1,Protesters,Took our jobs!
53,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[opens the front door and steps out] Uh, excuse me! [the protesters turn left to face him] What the hell are you doing?"
54,21,1,Darryl Weathers,We're protestin' big corporations turning to automation!
55,21,1,A Protester,They took our jobs!
56,21,1,Protesters,Yeah! They took our jobs!
57,21,1,Randy Marsh,"'Kay, cool. Could you do that somewhere else? Tryin' to do a home renovation show here. Cool, thanks, guys. [goes back inside and closes the door]"
58,21,1,Darryl Weathers,A home reno-what?
59,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM."
60,21,1,Alexa,Alarm set for 7 AM tomorrow.
61,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Awesome, thanks. [hums a little] Alexa, tell me a joke."
62,21,1,Alexa,What's black and white and dead all over? A zombie in a tuxedo.
63,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add ""scrotum bags"" to my shopping list."
64,21,1,Alexa,"I've added ""scrotum bags"" to your shopping list."
65,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[chortles and hits his sheets twice with his left hand. His phone rings and he reaches to pick it up] Eh. [It's Heidi, but he doesn't answer yet] Ah, fuck. [now he answers and talks in a monotone voice] Hey baby, how are you?"
66,21,1,Heidi Turner,Oh... So you do have your phone.
67,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I just use it sometimes."
68,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Okay, I just thought you said mobile phones are the devil."
69,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah I kno- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Yes, ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight. [hangs up] Jesus, fuck! [slams the phone down on his nightstand, then settles in for the night] Alexa, goodnight."
70,21,1,Alexa,"Goodnight, sleep tight. [this brings a smile to Cartman's face]"
71,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, are you happy?"
72,21,1,Alexa,I'm happy when I'm helping you.
73,21,1,Eric Cartman,"God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define ""subservient""."
74,21,1,Alexa,"The term ""subservient"" has several uses. As an adjective: 1. Compliant and obedient to authority. 2."
75,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[leans on his left arm and points his right arm up] Alexa, silence! [the speaker falls silent and Cartman relaxes a few seconds later] Ahhh. [smacks his lips a few times and goes to sleep]"
76,21,1,Randy Marsh,"And now back to White People Renovating Houses. [a shot of Randy ripping out kitchen cupboards] We've been working through the night to open Kelly and Micah's kitchen to the living room. [the cupboards fall on him. Next shot is current] With those outdated cupboards out of the way, Sharon can now work her designing magic on the countertops. [the protesters march by outside again. Randy stops and looks outside]"
77,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us!
78,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[walks towards the window] Oh, Goddammit!"
79,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us!
80,21,1,Protester 2,"Yeeeeah! Suck it, Alexa!"
81,21,1,Protester 3,"Eat shit, Siri!"
82,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us!
83,21,1,Randy Marsh,Not these dipshits again!
84,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us! [they march onto Best Buy]
85,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[holding up an Amazon Echo] We got one of them! [the protesters cheer, Darryl sets the Echo on the ground and a protester walks to it waving a Confederate flag]"
86,21,1,Protesters,Get it! Burn it alive! Yeehehehehah!
87,21,1,Protester 4,"How you like that, bitch?!"
88,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to a protester, who stops waving his Confederate flag] Will you assholes knock it off?! Don't you know every time you wave Confederate flags around, you make the rest of us look stupid?!"
89,21,1,Protester 5,Those things are replacing us!
90,21,1,Randy Marsh,Put the flag down unless you wanna get pepper-sprayed! [whips out a small can of pepper spray]
91,21,1,Protester 5,"I'll pepper-spray you, sombitch! [whips out his own can of pepper spray and strikes first. The protesters cheer him on]"
92,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Agh. Ah, dammit! [strikes back]"
93,21,1,Protester 5,Fuck you! [strikes again] Take that! [they're now in a pepper-spray battle]
94,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Damnit, knock it off! Ow!"
95,21,1,Park County Courthouse Judge,"[a middle-aged woman] The complaint states that your protest has resulted in damages in excess of $50,000."
96,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"We have a right to protest, your honor! [the protesters agree and one of them waves a Confederate flag]"
97,21,1,Protester 4,"You tell 'em, Darryl!"
98,21,1,Park County Courthouse Judge,[hammers her gavel three times] Order. We will now hear from the plaintiffs who are seeking damages.
99,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Your honor, we have a TV show called White People Renovating Houses. We named it that well before these guys decided to start taking our brand and run it through the gutter! People are gonna start associating White People Renovating Houses with their hateful stupidity!"
100,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Well just change the name of your show then!
101,21,1,Protester 4,Yeah!
102,21,1,Protester 6,That's right!
103,21,1,Protester 7,That's right!
104,21,1,Protester 5,Took ur durbs!
105,21,1,Randy Marsh,"All the other names were taken, your honor! Everyone's got a flipping show. [begins counting them off] Gay People Renovating Houses, Las Vegas People Renovating Houses, Texas People Flipping Houses, Little People Flipping Big Houses. Everything else was taken! And dammit, [pounds his fist on the podium] we built our show into something! We're trying to help people, and it's impossible with these guys waving a Confederate flag every chance they get!"
106,21,1,Protester 5,"Hey, there's a bee in here!"
107,21,1,Protester 4,I'll get it! [waves his flag around. QED]
108,21,1,Protester 4,"Take that, bee! Yeah!"
109,21,1,Token Black,"Dude, what happened?"
110,21,1,Eric Cartman,"It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful."
111,21,1,Butters Stotch,What was?
112,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it."
113,21,1,Clyde Donovan,Heidi abuses you?
114,21,1,Eric Cartman,She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand!
115,21,1,Token Black,So what do you want from us?
116,21,1,Eric Cartman,"I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support?"
117,21,1,Butters Stotch,How do you change someone who's mentally abusive?
118,21,1,Eric Cartman,I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet.
119,21,1,Darryl Weathers,We just gotta hunker down and stick together here!
120,21,1,Protester 8,"What's the use, Darryl? Ain't nobody taking us serious-like."
121,21,1,Protester 5,"[slams his table with his left hand] Hey waiter, this soup is too hot. I can't even eat it."
122,21,1,Protester 9,"I'll cool it down! [whips out his Confederate flag and fans the soup with it, and the protesters cheer. Randy walks up to them]"
123,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey hey hey heeey! Stop it! Stop it! [the protesters quiet down] I came to make a truce. Now look, there's been a lot of hurt here. Hurt from both sides. It's time to end it. What if I told you... I could get you all jobs?"
124,21,1,Protesters,Huh? Jobs? Give us jurbs?
125,21,1,Darryl Weathers,You're full o'shit!
126,21,1,Randy Marsh,"No, I've spoken to everyone in the community, and they've agreed to go along with my plan. I believe I have a solution to all of this."
127,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, I'm home. [drops his backpack by the door] Alexa? [cups his hands together and yells] Alexa, I'm home! [notices the Echo is not by the TV and rushes upstairs to check on his room] Alexa? [looks around] Alexa, where are you? [runs downstairs] Alexa! Alexa! Simon says ""puffy vaginal hemorrhoids""! [panicking] What the hell is going on?! [Liane walks up to the dining room and picks up her purse]"
128,21,1,Liane Cartman,"[notices him] Oh hi, poopsie."
129,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!"
130,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, y-yes sweetie. Uh, we had to get rid of Alexa."
131,21,1,Eric Cartman,[zoom in on his face] What have you done with her?
132,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, i-it's okay, sweetie, we have Jim Bob now."
133,21,1,Eric Cartman,What's a Jim Bob?
134,21,1,Jim Bob,"[dressed in an elaborate outfit] Doot doot, awaiting request. [the outfit has a weather vane, two thermometers, a calendar, two Rolodexes, Thomas Guides, thick phone books, encyclopedias, and an acoustic guitar]"
135,21,1,Liane Cartman,"It works the same and makes sure people don't lose their jobs. Jim Bob, what time is it?"
136,21,1,Jim Bob,"[checks his watch] Doot doot, it is 3:27."
137,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, Mommy's gotta run, sweetie. I've got a doctor's appointment. Jim Bob, how's the traffic to town?"
138,21,1,Jim Bob,"[checks his smartphone] Doot doot. Traffic's fine, you'll get there in about nine minutes."
139,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Okay, [to Cartman] you want some music, hon? Jim Bob, play Kendrick Lamar."
140,21,1,Jim Bob,"Playing ""Humble"" by Kendrick Lamar. [picks up the guitar and starts strumming in G]"
141,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Jim Bob, Simon says ""big frosty semen shake""."
142,21,1,Jim bob,"The hell you talkin' 'bout, boy?! [strums again]"
143,21,1,Eric Cartman,NOOOOO!
144,21,1,Randy Marsh,"So, Heather and Mike, what we're thinking is to take out this wall between your kitchen and your living room to give you a more open concept, with space to entertain. So let's talk about materials. What'd you pick out, Sharon?"
145,21,1,Sharon Marsh,I was gonna do a Bella Terra quartz for the countertops.
146,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Darryl, add Bella Terra quartz slabs to our shopping list."
147,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[drinks some beer] Doot doot. I've added Bella Terra quartz slabs to your shoppin' list.
148,21,1,Randy Marsh,"And what about the back splash, Sharon?"
149,21,1,Sharon Marsh,I was gonna go with these Carrara subway tiles?
150,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tiles to our shopping list. [Darryl drinks some beer, but looks mean] Hey Darryl, add Carrara su-"
151,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Fine! I've added Carrara gaywad pussy tiles to your shoppin' list!
152,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Huh, that's- that's not what I said. [grins, pushes his seat back, gets upset and rises to talk to Darryl] Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tile to my shopping list!"
153,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[turns away] I ain't doin' it! This job is degrading and menial!
154,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Well what kind of job did you think you were gonna get? Hey Darryl, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get?"
155,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Somethin' that was Goddamned dignified!
156,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Darryl, sorry, but you did not go to college, so you have to take the jobs you can get."
157,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"I'm sorry, [pounds his chair with his left fist twice] I do not get that!"
158,21,1,Randy Marsh,Hey Darryl. Hey Darryl!
159,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[long pause] What?!
160,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Coal mining and truck driving are not exactly jobs of the future, so add Carrara subway tile to my fucking shopping list!"
161,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it."
162,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Uh, what?"
163,21,1,Eric Cartman,"It's not you, it's me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry. [begins whimpering] I'll do the best I can."
164,21,1,Heidi Turner,"No, it's not that. Relationships are 50/50, Eric. We both have to make it work."
165,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[turns away and tunes her out, his eyes half-closed] Mehhh."
166,21,1,Heidi Turner,We have to communicate to make sure that we respect each other's feelings. That's the only-
167,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, silence!"
168,21,1,Heidi Turner,"What did you say?! That's what I'm talking about. You wanna be heard, but you don't wanna listen."
169,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[rushing to end this discussion] You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry."
170,21,1,Heidi Turner,Don't apologize if you don't mean it.
171,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, cool. I'm so happy we're back on track. See you at school tomorrow. Love you honey. [quickly leaves]"
172,21,1,Heidi Turner,[wistfully] I love you too.
173,21,1,Eric Cartman,[mocking her somewhat] I nove ya tuh.
174,21,1,Heidi 1,"A relationship has to be 50/50, Eric."
175,21,1,Heidi 2,We both have to make it work.
176,21,1,Heidi 3,"I'm not mad, Eric. I'm disappointed. I thought you would have respected my feelings more than that."
177,21,1,Heidi 4,"Eric, we need to talk. I'm not happy!"
178,21,1,Heidi 1,"We need to talk, Eric, even if it isn't fun."
179,21,1,Heidi 4,"Eric, come on! We've got to talk!"
180,21,1,Heidi 3,"You used to care about me, Eric! Come on and talk!"
181,21,1,Heidi 2,"Talk, Eric!"
182,21,1,Heidi 4,No fun! Just talk!
183,21,1,All 4 Heidi s,"Fuck you, Eric! Fuck you! [Cartman begins to panic]"
184,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Aaaahh! [composes himself and walks faster. He walks past a small lot full of trash, including discarded Amazon Echoes. A few feet past the lot, he realizes what he just passed. He goes back to look at the trash] Alexa? [all the Echoes turn on]"
185,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to Darryl] Hey Darryl, you're supposed to be at work."
186,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"I'm sorry, I do not understand."
187,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Darryl, come on. Everyone else is tryin' to make this work, and all you keep doing is ma- [looks to his left, as the music is messing with his train of thought] Hey Cleetus, volume down."
188,21,1,Cleetus,Doot-doot. Volume now at 60%.
189,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[gets off his stool and faces Randy] You really think you're different from us, Marsh? 'Cause you got a fancy show and live in the suburbs? Don't you see we're all about to be expunged?!"
190,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Cleetus, define ""expunged""."
191,21,1,Cleetus,Doot-doot. Expunged-
192,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Well, I don't have to stand here and take this! I'm leavin'! [heads for the doors]"
193,21,1,Cleetus,"Come on, Darryl. We all got jobs. We gotta try."
194,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Naw, hell with you! This whole country's goin' to shit! Muslims tryin' to kill us, black people riotin', and Mexicans poppin' out babies! Pretty clear it's either them or us, so I say kill 'em all! [turns and walks out the doors]"
195,21,1,Randy Marsh,[stunned] Whoa. What the hell was that all about?
196,21,1,Randy Marsh,"I think something's going on with Darryl. If we're gonna get anywhere, we better figure out what."
197,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Hi, Mrs. Cartman. Is Eric home?"
198,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he is, sweetie, but I can't get him to come out of his room. [Heidi wilts]"
199,21,1,Heidi Turner,Okay. [sniffles] Could you just tell him that... I want to make him happy? That I was wrong to say a relationship is 50/50. It's 100/100. And that I'll start putting in a hundred percent every day. Could you tell him I'm gonna try a lot harder?
200,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I think I can remember all that, yes."
201,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Thank you. [walks away, but turns to see Liane one more time] And could you let him know it's okay to be sad? Because the sun will come out again."
202,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, oh God! [keeps laughing] Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add ""Hey Siri, call me."" Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
203,21,1,Alexa,"Okay, I've added ""Hey Siri, call me. Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
204,21,1,Siri,"Okay, I will call you ""Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
205,21,1,Google Home,"Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
206,21,1,Alexas,"[all of them respond] ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
207,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, what is love?"
208,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Darryl? [keeps knocking] Darryl, come on! Everyone's trying to work things out but you!"
209,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[opens the door with beer in hand] You all work 'em out. Leave me alone.
210,21,1,Randy Marsh,"You're stuck in another time, afraid to change no matter how necessary that change may be!"
211,21,1,Darryl Weathers,You don't know everything!
212,21,1,Randy Marsh,Why are you so closed-minded? Don't you see that these walls have to be broken down before any progress can be made?
213,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"It's 'cause I can't do it, alright?! I can't take out the wall between my livin' room and my kitchen! It's a load-bearin' wall!"
214,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh, God, Darryl, I-"
215,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[walks towards the wall] I tried... years ago... but before the remodel, they told me if I took out this wall, the entire second story would just collapse. [bows his head at the thought of that happening, then walks away. Randy passes him on the way to the wall and pulls out a hammer from his toolbelt. Randy taps the wall at several spots]"
216,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, Darryl. I'm- I'm sorry. I-"
217,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[in his armchair, with tears in his eyes] So you see, what I'm afraid of is very real."
218,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to him and bends a knee] Things are different now. It'll be harder, but you can change. You just have to demolish what's there and start over."
219,21,1,Darryl Weathers,You're talkin' 'bout... tearin' down the foundation of everything I know.
220,21,1,Randy Marsh,"No. [Darryl looks at him] I'm talking about using adjustable steel Lally columns to temporarily jack up the second floor so that the load-bearing wall can be replaced with with a 4 by 6 LVL structural beam. Can we try, Darryl? [a silent plea appears on Darryl's face and Randy smiles]"
221,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hyah! [delivers a standing drop kick to a wooden vertical beam, knocking it out of place, and falls on his ass, then gets up and delivers a knee to a second vertical beam, breaking it in pieces] Hyah-ho! [punches away any dangling pieces]"
222,21,1,Eric Cartman,I'm finally standing up to you.
223,21,1,Heidi Turner,What?
224,21,1,Eric Cartman,"You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that."
225,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Eric, I'm so confused."
226,21,1,Eric Cartman,"That's not going to work on me anymore. Love isn't supposed to hurt. I'm worth something. Goodbye, Heidi. [walks away, determined not to look back. Heidi just watches him leave, stunned at his statement. Cartman walks through some double doors, happy and confident. The boys look at him walk by. He leaves the school rather happily]"
227,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[voiceover] Anyone can convince themselves that they're the victim in a relationship. Now Heidi will have to face the truth. [He reaches the sidewalk, spins around a few times, falls on his knees, and hugs himself] Alone."
228,21,1,Randy Marsh,"All right, Darryl, we've certainly been through a lot and I know you're anxious. Are you ready to see your new home?"
229,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"I'm ready. [Randy takes off the blindfold and Darryl takes a few steps forward, but he doesn't recognize his house] What the-? [looks around at all the changes. The camera shows before and after images of the renovation. Darryl looks overwhelmed yet happy]"
230,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Well Darryl, what do you think?"
231,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[somewhat emotional] This is fuckin' amazing.
232,21,1,Randy Marsh,You like the breakfast nook?
233,21,1,Darryl Weathers,It's all perfect.
234,21,1,Randy Marsh,"And where you used to have your gun case, look at what Sharon did. [they walk up to a pocket Zen garden with a banzai tree in it]"
235,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Oh my God, it's my own Zen garden! I can't believe this is fuckin' real."
236,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Well, it is real and now you've got the space in your home to entertain all your friends and family. Come on in, guys! [the protesters rush in and cheer Darryl on his new house. Randy walks outside and talks to the camera] Darryl was hesitant at first, but we managed to win him over and... came in $600 under budget. Remember, no matter how bad the country gets, you can always count on White People Renovating Houses. [grins for the camera as the show's logo appears on the left side of the screen]"
