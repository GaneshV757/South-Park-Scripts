0,21,5,Marcus Dad,"Okay, okay, can everyone hear me? [taps on the mic to make sure it works] Hello? [the kids quiet down a bit] Thanks, everyone, for helping us celebrate Marcus' birthday. [the kids clap for him] As a special birthday surprise for you, Marcus, we got you your favorite entertainer. Everyone, please welcome Chuck E. Cheese. [A Chuck E. Cheese mascot stumbles onto the stage]"
1,21,5,Chuck E Cheese,Hey. [hits his snout on the mic] Check.
2,21,5,Marcus Preston,[laughs as the other kids cheer] Yes. Yehehehehes.
3,21,5,Chuck E Cheese,"[hits his snout on the mic again, pics up a guitar, and begins to play it as he sings] I ah thanks... for'm celeb... Marcus's birthday."
4,21,5,Marcus Mom,What's wrong with him?
5,21,5,Marcus Dad,Can't you tell? He's high on painkillers!
6,21,5,Chuck E. Cheese,"[stumbles some more and mumbles] Hold on. [strums] Shit. Okay, let's.... do this... [Strums] Never meant to cause you any so- [barfs on stage, falls forward onto the ground in front of the stage and dies. Marcus screams]"
7,21,5,Marcus Dad,"All right, kids, uh, why don't we head back to the party and cut the cake?"
8,21,5,Marcus Preston,I don't want cake! Who's gonna eat cake at a time like this?! [wails. A paramedic closes the back doors of the ambulance as a police officer stands watch]
9,21,5,Officer Stevens,Another drug overdose?
10,21,5,Johnson,"[the paramedic, hands the officer two medications] Most likely. Percolate and Oxycontin found wrapped in his cheesecloth."
11,21,5,Officer Stevens,"Prescription drugs, but with no prescription."
12,21,5,Johnson,You guys know where all these illegal meds are coming from?
13,21,5,Officer Stevens,Most likely from the prisons. Whenever there's a drug epidemic you can usually trace it back to people who've been... thrown away by society and forgotten about.
14,21,5,Vicky,[receptionist] Can I help you?
15,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa?"
16,21,5,Vicky,"[puts her hand over her heart] Oh, how nice of you. All right, arms in the air. [two burly men approach Stan. One, Tony, takes the present and hands it to Vicky, the other, Toby, wands Stan. Vicky opens the package] What's the present?"
17,21,5,Stan Marsh,It's just some Hummels.
18,21,5,Vicky,"More Hummels? Why are senior citizens so infatuated with these little German statues? All right, go on, you got ten minutes. [Tony hands the present back to Stan, who goes on in]"
19,21,5,Stan Marsh,Grandpa?
20,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[looking out the window, turns to see him] Billy! [turns around and wheels towards him] Finally you're here to visit. Did you bring Grandpa a present?"
21,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[gives Marvin the present] Yeah, I got what you wanted. [Marvin wheels away to his desk, where he opens the present.]"
22,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Awww, Merry Wanderer [The Hummel with yellow umbrella and bowler hat] and Happy Traveler? [The Hummel with bindle and feather in its cap] These Hummels suck!"
23,21,5,Stan Marsh,That's what the guy gave me.
24,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"It's okay, Billy. I'm just gonna need you to deliver another one of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows."
25,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come on, Grandpa. Isn't it enough I come to visit?"
26,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"You don't understand how it works in here. Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch. You do what she says, or you pay the price."
27,21,5,Elderly Man 1,"Oh, please, uh I don't want no trouble. [the three women enter his room] I'm sorry. I'll get better Hummels."
28,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, Stan. Come on, dude, we're gonna go set off fireworks at Kenny's house."
29,21,5,Stan Marsh,I will. I just gotta do this for my grandpa first.
30,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him?"
31,21,5,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. It's what he wants. I feel bad for him, all right? I think he's miserable."
32,21,5,Eric Cartman,He's old. He's supposed to be miserable.
33,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Look, I just gotta make this exchange for him and then we can go. Oh, oh, I think this is her now. [a red fox with blue gloves and mask prances over]"
34,21,5,Swiper the Fox,"Are you Stan Marsh? It's me, Swiper."
35,21,5,Stan Marsh,Cool. Do you have the Hummel?
36,21,5,Swiper the Fox,"[looks around, then reaches into her tote bag and pulls one out] This is it. Ride Into Christmas, Limited Edition. Now give me the pillow. I have to get to a birthday party."
37,21,5,Stan Marsh,"'Kay, fine. [makes the exchange, and Swiper shakes the pillow until she's satisfied]"
38,21,5,Swiper the Fox,"All right, peace. [prances away]"
39,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's really weird."
40,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Old people love Hummels, dude."
41,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Students, faculty, and staff, today we are facing an epidemic of catastrophic proportions. I know I am not alone in mourning the loss of one of our greatest entertainers, [click. A picture comes up on the projector screen] Chuck E. Cheese. Had we known the personal hell he was going through, perhaps we could've helped. But toooo many were more than eager to supply Chuck E. with the opioids that caused his untimely death. Chuck E. was not the first entertainer to die from this epidemic. Let us not forget Dinkie Dook the Clown [shown with an accordion], dead of a Roxanol overdose at Tommy Schneider's bar mitzvah last March. Shimmer and Shine [two genies], who both collapsed from massive amounts of oxycodone at Nelly Anderson's birthday party. Spider-man, cut down in prime by Demerol, and just recently, Swiper the Fox. dead of multiple opioids found in his crochet pillow. How many more entertainers must we lose before we take action?! It is time to declare war on opioids in our society! [the kids cheer and clap as Stan Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are shocked at what they just heard]"
42,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!"
43,21,5,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, all right?!"
44,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,You didn't know you were slinging drugs for your grandpa?
45,21,5,Stan Marsh,It didn't occur to me as a possibility.
46,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on!"
47,21,5,Stan Marsh,I had no idea what was going on!
48,21,5,Butters Stotch,"[walks in and goes to the urinal] Hey fellas! [smiles and looks at them, then turns around and drops his pants and briefs, then lifts up his shirt and pees in the urinal] Boy, that Marcus kid is on the warpath, huh? Well, he's really motivated. I mean, screw that kid, but I guess it's good somebody's finally doing something about these goddamn drug dealers. [Butters finishes, flushes the urinal, zips up, and turns towards the other boys and looks at them again, smiling] Well, see ya, fellas. [turns left and walks out. The other boys haven't moved an inch the whole time he was there]"
49,21,5,Eric Cartman,Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in!
50,21,5,Stan Marsh,"No, we don't have to do that! Let me talk to him. I can put a stop to this."
51,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[whispering] Grandpa, what the hell have you gotten me into?!"
52,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[whispering] Shhh, quiet. They'll hear you!"
53,21,5,Stan Marsh,"There were drugs in the crochet pillow, weren't there?! Do you know people are dying?!"
54,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"What do you want me to do, Billy? You see Ms. McGullicutty over there? [she's shown tripping a man as he walks to a table with his lunch and chuckling to herself] Whoever has the best Hummel collection is top bitch in this place, and she's got the best. She's ruthless, and she has those old lady farts. You know old lady farts, right? Where they're so loose they don't even acknowledge they happened?"
55,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,"Oh, hello Mr. Marsh. [pfffft]"
56,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, Ms. McGullicutty. How are you feeling today?"
57,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,I'm doing very well. [turns her back to him and farts again] Have they given you Percocet for that knee of yours? [pfffft]
58,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, yeah, here, I I just got it, huh. Here you go. [hands her the Percocet]"
59,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,"Oh, you'd almost think you were trying to keep them from me. [pfffft]"
60,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh, ma'am? My grandpa actually really needs those drugs. He's in a lot of pain."
61,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,"Ohhh, and who's this little rascal? [walks around to Stan's chair and looks over his shoulder]"
62,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"That's my grandson, uh he he's worthless."
63,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,"How sweet. [pfffft] Hmmm, coming to visit your old poppa in the joint, huh? You love your poppa, don't you? [pfffft. Stan winces] You'd hate to see him suffer even more he already is. [slow, soft pfffft. Stan avoids looking at her and winces again. Now she addresses Marvin] You watch your ass, Marsh, or I'll have you sent to the quiet room. [pfffft. She turns right and walks away, hitting a man with her can on the way out]"
64,21,5,Stan Marsh,"What, what is she talking about? What's the quiet room?"
65,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"I told you, she has all the pull in here. You go against what she says, you end up in solitaire."
66,21,5,Mr Standish,"No! No, please, uh I didn't do anything!"
67,21,5,Tony,"It's all right, Mr. Standish, you just need a little quiet time."
68,21,5,Mr Standish,"Uh, I don't even know how to play solitaire. Please! [they lock him up and leave]"
69,21,5,Marcus Preston,I understand that today they are performing Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?
70,21,5,Receptionist,"Oh, the kids' party performer. Yeah."
71,21,5,Marcus Preston,"As a concerned member of the public, I wish to be present."
72,21,5,Receptionist,"Uh, sorry, children aren't really allowed in autopsies."
73,21,5,Marcus Preston,Then I shall wait here to learn the coroner's findings.
74,21,5,Coroner,"Toxicology reports show subject had massive amounts of opioids in system at time of death. Now proceeding. [he and his assistant pull the sheet off and the coroner begins to saw the performer's mask off. The officer begins to feel sick. The mask is finally removed, and the officer vomits]"
75,21,5,Coroner,Have these put in the garbage.
76,21,5,Marcus Preston,"What did you find, coroner?"
77,21,5,Coroner,Who is this?
78,21,5,Marcus Preston,"There is an epidemic in our community, sir. Some of us actually care to confront the problem! Now, dammit, what did you find?"
79,21,5,Coroner,Nothing out of the ordinary. The subject died of a simple overdose. We found nothing else except for two Hummmels in the subject's rectal cavity.
80,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Hummels? In his rectal cavity, you say? And you do not find this out of the ordinary?"
81,21,5,Coroner,Not at all. We found Hummels in nearly all the birthday entertainers' anal cavities. It's very common in our overdose victims.
82,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Mmmm, a bit too common, don't you think?"
83,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Guys, why does Grandpa have to be in a nursing home? Can't he live with us again?"
84,21,5,Randy Marsh,"Stan, Grandpas has a lot of needs that we can't provide him here. He needs professional supervision."
85,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Is that really it? Because I, I just feel like we kind of threw Grandpa away and forgot about him."
86,21,5,Randy Marsh,Oh really? Do you have any idea how much money we pay to have Grandpa in that place? Your grandpa is stylin'! Can you imagine being able to just sit around all day and not have to do anything but eat and watch TV?
87,21,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I'd probably go crazy and wanna kill myself.
88,21,5,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, Stan! It's not like he's in jail!"
89,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's kind of like jail. You should go visit him."
90,21,5,Randy Marsh,"I can't! I'm too busy busting my ass to pay the bills for that place, and to pay for your guitar lessons!"
91,21,5,Stan Marsh,I don't have guitar lessons.
92,21,5,Randy Marsh,I don't want to go there. It's depressing. Aw you tricked me.
93,21,5,Stan Marsh,[his phone rings and he answers] Hello?
94,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,[at the downtown corner with Butters] Dude! Did you give Butters a crochet pillow to drop off?!
95,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[quickly leaves the table] Dude, I don't have a choice. I have to get the Hummels for my grandpa."
96,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, you need to get Hummels without making Butters a drug dealer!"
97,21,5,Butters Stotch,Drug dealer??
98,21,5,Stan Marsh,"All right, all right! I think I know another way."
99,21,5,Delivery Man,"Hey, we have this week's delivery of medications."
100,21,5,Vicky,"Bring them in. [the delivery man goes outside and motions for a truck driver to back up and dump the medications. The truck backs up and dumps the meds onto the asphalt at the community's entrance, then rolls away. Stan has walked up to the community entrance and watches the truck leave]"
101,21,5,Stan Marsh,Ah!
102,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Hello, Mr. Marsh."
103,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Uh hey, hey Marcus."
104,21,5,Marcus Preston,I understand you've become quite the Hummel collector lately. What's the... fascination with Hummels?
105,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Nothing. I-look, I, I just really like Hummels, okay? I'm just, I'm really into Hummels."
106,21,5,Marcus Preston,Ah! I see. So then you should be able to tell me what this Hummel is called!
107,21,5,Stan Marsh,"That, that's uh..."
108,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Come on! If you're a Hummel expert, then you should know its name!"
109,21,5,Stan Marsh,"That, it's, it's ""Whistling In The Rain."""
110,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Wrong! It's called ""Stormy Weather!"" Do you know where it was found?"
111,21,5,Stan Marsh,No.
112,21,5,Marcus Preston,"It was found deep in the anus of one Chuck E. Cheese, the renowned entertainer beloved by millions! If you know something about the epidemic that is killing artists, you'd better cough it up!"
113,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Marcus, trust me. You don't wanna get involved."
114,21,5,Marcus Preston,"I became involved when Chuck E. Cheese collapsed like a rag doll before my very eyes! If you had any involvement, I will bring you down!"
115,21,5,Randy Marsh,"Well, it's really great seeing you, Dad. Guess we oughtta hit the road soon."
116,21,5,Marvin Marsh,You finally come to visit and leave after 10 minutes?
117,21,5,Randy Marsh,"Aw Jesus, now we know where Stan gets his guilt trips from!"
118,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"[appears at Marvin's door] Mmmm [Marvin looks over his shoulder], it seems somebody's been a little naughty lately. [pfffft]"
119,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[turns a bit to see her] Oh, Ms. McGullicutty, heh heh. How are you?"
120,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"[walks over to Marvin's meager Hummel collection] Hrrmm. My, what a lovely Hummel collection you're starting to amass. [sniffs] Almost smells [pfffft]... brand new, doesn't it? [pfft. She turns to face Marvin] Like it was purchased right from the factory. [pfffft] Ooooo! And who are these lovely people? [walks up to Randy and Sharon] Family that came to visit, no doubt? [pfft]"
121,21,5,Randy Marsh,"[holding his breath] Yes. Yeah, we love coming here."
122,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"Ah, family. I remember when I was a little girl. [pfffft] My brother used to play such tricks on me. [pfft-pfft] Tried to fool me. Tried to get out from his responsibilities. [pfffft]"
123,21,5,Marvin Marsh,I'm giving you Hummels. What's it matter where they came from? [Mrs. McGullicutty farts again]
124,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"[chuckles] Nooo, [Randy covers his nose] it doesn't matter to me. But it matters to them. [pfffft] The big guys. You see, what they want is more people who are addicted to crochet pillows. [pfffft] Got it? [pfffft. She makes her way towards the door] Nice to meet you fine folks. [pfffft]"
125,21,5,Randy Marsh,Wugh. [whispers to Sharon] We're never visiting here again.
126,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Ohooo, you're dead Butters."
127,21,5,Butters Stotch,Haw Jeez.
128,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[runs in] Guys! Guys, I need your help."
129,21,5,Eric Cartman,"If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out."
130,21,5,Stan Marsh,I just talked to my grandpa. There's more at work here than just old people pushing pills.
131,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, we told you we don't wanna be involved."
132,21,5,Stan Marsh,[stands in front of the TV] The head bitch of the nursing home is gonna take my grandpa down. Maybe my whole family.
133,21,5,Butters Stotch,"[trying to see the game] Get out of the way, dude!"
134,21,5,Stan Marsh,But I know what to do! Whoever has the best Hummels controls the nursing home. We've gotta steal this lady's Hummel collection and give it to my grandpa!
135,21,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Stan] Dude, Stan, even if we wanted to help you, which we don't, there's no way we can sneak into an old folks home, distract all the old people, and take an old lady's Hummels! [turns to the left with a thought and walks off] Oh wait, there totally is a way we could do that."
136,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[catches up] Yeah? What ih, what is it, Cartman."
137,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're not getting involved!"
138,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, if you have an idea, please tell me. I need you."
139,21,5,Eric Cartman,I know how to distract old people.
140,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,Haww shit!
141,21,5,Marcus Preston,Yes?
142,21,5,Annie,We're at Mimi Thompson's party. Peppa Pig just collapsed on stage. [it's Mimi's 10th birthday]
143,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Oh my God! Don't let anyone near Peppa Pig until I arrive! [leaves the house. Soon he's at the party] Move aside! Let me through! [reaches the stage and kneels next to Peppa] Aw Peppa. Peppa, can you hear me? [Peppa moans] My name is Marcus Preston. Can you understand me? Where did you get the drugs, Peppa? Was it from Stan Marsh?"
144,21,5,Peppa Pig,"[a black man in costume] Yo man, whatchoo talkin' about? Get me a fuckin' ambulance!"
145,21,5,Marcus Preston,"[tearing up] Shh, Peppa. Focus. Soon you'll be in heaven jumping in all the puddles you can imagine. But first, you must tell me, where do the Hummels go, Peppa?"
146,21,5,Ambulance lady,"All right, let us through. Get away, kids."
147,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Peppa, now! Why Hummels?! You've got to squeal!"
148,21,5,Peppa Pig,Old people. Old people... love... Hummels. [groans a couple more times and dies]
149,21,5,Marcus Preston,"It's okay, she's with Chuck E. Cheese now."
150,21,5,Vicky,Can I help you?
151,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people."
152,21,5,Vicky,Didn't think we had anyone scheduled tonight. Are you with the Protestant youth group?
153,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can."
154,21,5,Vicky,"Fine. Round them up, we got another kids choir!"
155,21,5,Toby,"Come on, let's go. Children's choir in the commons."
156,21,5,Residents,[amid groans] Aw dammit. Shit.
157,21,5,Toby,Darlin' children are gonna sing for you! Move your asses!
158,21,5,Elderly Man 2,"Aw, not again."
159,21,5,Eric Cartman,"All right, seniors. How are we feeling tonight? Our youth group has come to lift your spirits with some songs to take you down memory lane. We hope you can enjoy some nice old-people music. [blows into a pitch pipe to determine a scale to sing in]"
160,21,5,Eric Cartman,I'm... insane in the membrane.
161,21,5,The Boys,Insane in the membrane.
162,21,5,Butters Stotch,Insane in the brain
163,21,5,The Boys,"Crazy insane, got no brain."
164,21,5,Eric Cartman,In the membrane.
165,21,5,Eric Cartman,Myyyy milkshake brings all the boys
166,21,5,The Boys,"to the yard, and they're like [Butters sticks his finger into his mouth and pops it out] it's better than yours."
167,21,5,Eric Cartman,Damn right!
168,21,5,The Boys,[Butters sticks his finger into his mouth and pops it out] it's better than yours.
169,21,5,Eric Cartman,"My hot milkshake.

 And now here's our own take on that oldie, but goodie by Nirvana."
170,21,5,The Boys,"In the cool, cool winter."
171,21,5,Eric Cartman,Rape me.
172,21,5,The Boys,"In the hot hot summertime.
Rape me, my friend."
173,21,5,Elderly Man 3,You suck!
174,21,5,Eric Cartman,Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives!
175,21,5,Elderly Man 3,[gives Cartman the bird] Fuck you!
176,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Fuck you! [picks a different note] 
If you"
177,21,5,The Boys,Want to call me baby
178,21,5,Eric Cartman,Just go ahead now-
179,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Hello, Mr. Marsh!"
180,21,5,Stan Marsh,Marcus.
181,21,5,Marcus Preston,[turns on the light] I told you I'd bring you down. [quickly takes out his phone and takes a picture]
182,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Marcus, it's not what you think. I'm trying to make things better here. [he and Marcus begin to walk around each other slowly]"
183,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Oh, I bet you are! You, your grandpa, ALL the people here, are going to jail! I'm calling the police!"
184,21,5,Stan Marsh,"You can put an end to this place, but you won't be stopping the problem. These people are victims too, Marcus. Victims of a way bigger game being played by way bigger people!"
185,21,5,Marcus Preston,"[turns his back to Stan] Oh, you're a fine one for speeches! When it comes to saving your own ass!"
186,21,5,Stan Marsh,"It's not for me, Marcus. Look, I know you loved Chuck E. Cheese. [Marcus stops dialing] I know you'd do anything to bring down the people who took him from you. [Marcus begins to soften and soon gets emotional] That's why you have to go further, Marcus. Take it to the people who profited from Chuck E.'s addiction."
187,21,5,Marcus Preston,"[turns around, sobbing] He was just a mouse... who wanted to make people happy. [walks up to Stan, and they hug each other]"
188,21,5,Stan Marsh,I know. I know.
189,21,5,The Boys,"No time to search the world around
When I come around. When I come around."
190,21,5,Eric Cartman,"I come around.

 [the residents begin to leave one by one]"
191,21,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey, where are ya'll goin'?"
192,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,Back to our rooms. You kids are absolutely awful. [pfffft]
193,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,[notices her door already open] What the? [pfft] Someone is in my room! [pfffft. She goes in with her two friends]
194,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,Whaaaat?! [pfffft]
195,21,5,Marvin Marsh,Billy. What are you doin' here?
196,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[moves to his right] Surprise, Grandpa. [a bag appears where Stan stood just moments ago] I got what you needed."
197,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Heh. [rolls forward] Billy, Mrs. McGullicutty's Hummel collection. You got it for me."
198,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Grandpa. Now you can put a stop to all this, right?"
199,21,5,Marvin Marsh,Yeah. I just might be able to.
200,21,5,Stan Marsh,"What are you doing, Grandpa?"
201,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"I told you, Billy. These Hummels hold a special power with old people."
202,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,[enters with her friends] You! [pfffft]
203,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[to Stan] Go on, get out of here."
204,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,You really thought stealing my Hummels would make you the head bitch in this place?! [pfffft]
205,21,5,Marvin Marsh,Yeah. I think it will. [swings the bag around and gives her a bloody nose]
206,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"Aaah! [Marvin swings the bag around and takes out Mrs. McGullicutty's friends, he keeps swinging at them as they escape his room. The other residents look out of their rooms and cheer him on. He swings at Mrs. McGullicutty all the way down the hallway until she stops moving. The boys arrive]"
207,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[turns and looks at the boys, and smiles] Now you know how we do shit in the nursing home."
