0,21,8,Counselor Steve,"Okay guys, it's November and who can tell me what that means? [points] Yes, Francis?"
1,21,8,Francis,It's time for the Special Ed Science Fair. [the other kids cheer]
2,21,8,Counselor Steve,"That's right, the Science Fair is this weekend, and I know you're all very excited to show the projects you've been working on. [more cheers] This week we'll be hearing all about your projects and first up we have Nathan and Mimallah. [amid some applause and chatter, Nathan and Mimsy walk in with their project, a volcano]"
3,21,8,Nathan,"For our science fait project, we will be showing the destructive force of nature by simulating a volcano!"
4,21,8,The kids,Ooooooh.
5,21,8,Nathan,"With vinegar and baking soda, we will make this paper-mâché volcano EXPLODE."
6,21,8,The kids,Aaaaaaa.
7,21,8,Nathan,With the power and fury of Mount Kilauea. Our science fair project is sure to be... a blast. Get it? A. Blast.
8,21,8,Counselor Steve,"All right, what do you guys think of Nathan and Mimallah's project idea? [the kids clap and cheer]"
9,21,8,Nathan,"We've done it, Mimsy. We're gonna win the science fair for sure. And then, every chick in this school is gonna wanna have sex with us."
10,21,8,Mimsy,"Uh, gee boss, I don't know about sex with no chicken."
11,21,8,Nathan,"[smack] Not those chicks, numbskull. I'm talkin' 'bout bitches. You know what girls like? They like winners. And when we win the science fair, we're gonna be up to our ears in pussy."
12,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Is it just me, or are things around here getting worse and worse?"
13,21,8,Millie Larsen,It's definitely not just you. I think everyone's in shock that Heidi went back to Cartman.
14,21,8,Theresa,What keeps driving her back to him? It's so weird.
15,21,8,Isla,She's so... mean and angry these days.
16,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"People change. They say you become more and more like the person you're with and, I guess it's true with Heidi."
17,21,8,Heidi Turner,[joins the girls at the table] Hey guys. What's up?
18,21,8,Isla,"Hey, Heidi."
19,21,8,Heidi Turner,What are you guys talkin' about?
20,21,8,Nichole Daniels,Nothing.
21,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Bullcrap, you're all talkin' about me again. 'Cause you're judgmental bitches. [burps] Ehhh."
22,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Heidi, are you okay? It's just... you look..."
23,21,8,Heidi Turner,I look what?
24,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Ngh, you know, y-you just look-"
25,21,8,Heidi Turner,"What? I look fat? Is that what you wanna say, Wendy? Fuck you, bitch!"
26,21,8,Theresa,"She's just concerned, Heidi."
27,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[mimicking] ""Mehmehmehmehmehhh, Heidi"". I'm just trying to enjoy my lunch here! Can I do it without you guys shitting on all over me?!"
28,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"All right, good, Timmy. Test 42a is successful. Let's move on to the next phase. [Nathan and Mimsy walk in]"
29,21,8,Nathan,"Well hello, gentlemen."
30,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh hey fellas, we're doing great."
31,21,8,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
32,21,8,Nathan,Thought we'd stop by to see how your- science fair project is going.
33,21,8,Mimsy,"Dah I thought we was comin' to rub their faces in how good our science fair project was, boss."
34,21,8,Nathan,"[gets mad, then smacks Mimsy] Shut up, Mimsyyy! [to Jimmy and Timmy] So what are you guys workin' on?"
35,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, it's fantastic. This year, Tim-Tim and I are doin' our project on [looks into the microscope] water bears."
36,21,8,Nathan,"Oh. Water bears. [backs up to Mimsy] You hear that, Mimsy? Like there's any such things as water bears. That blue science fair ribbon is as good as ours. [to Jimmy and Timmy] Well, we've gotta get back to our lava volcano. Good luck finding your, pft, water bears. [he and Mimsy turn around to walk out]"
37,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, would you like to see them?"
38,21,8,Nathan,[he and Mimsy stop and turn] What? Uh what are you talking about?
39,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Timmy and I have gathered thousands of water bears. Take a look in the microscope. [Nathan steps forward to look into the microscope. He sees some water bears swimming around on the specimen slide. Jimmy continues] Water bears are water-dwelling, eight-legged micro-animals."
40,21,8,Timmy Burch,Timmah.
41,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"They're one of nature's most resilient animals. [next slide] Studies have shown they can survive lava, and even the vacuum of space."
42,21,8,Nathan,What-? How-? [looks up] Where the fuck did you learn about these things?
43,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,Where all good scientists learn from. Octonauts.
44,21,8,Timmy Burch,Octonauts!
45,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,Some scientists believe the study of water bears is key to human survival.
46,21,8,Mimsy,"Aw jeez, that sounds a lot better than a lava volcano, huh boss?"
47,21,8,Nathan,"Well, not really, because the science fair is supposed to be an experiment. I fail to see what the experiment is here."
48,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, that's easy. You see, for the past several weeks, Tim-Tim and me have been training the water bears to respond to different sound waves. We found that they respond best to Taylor Swift. Hit it, Timmy. [Timmy presses a button offscreen, and Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do"" begins to play] Take a look. [the Water Bears soon form a circle of eight of them on the specimen slide. Timmy turns off the player] We still have some training to do, but we're excited about the results. I have to admit, your lava volcano is pretty great too. Maybe we could tie for first place. [Nathan looks at Jimmy, then at Timmy, in shock]"
49,21,8,Mr. Mackey,Come in.
50,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[enters the office] You wanted to see me, Mr. Mackey?"
51,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh yes, Heidi, uh, we just wanted to see if you have transportation to the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend, or if you wanted us to set somethin' up for you."
52,21,8,Heidi Turner,What?
53,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"...Uh, Saturday is the science fair, and, you're the judge for the competition?"
54,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Judge a special needs science fair? Ahem, no thanks."
55,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Well, Heidi, is there a problem with you bein' the judge this weekend?"
56,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Uhh, yeah? It's Saturday, and I don't wanna be at skewl?"
57,21,8,Mr. Mackey,But you're always the judge of the Special Ed Science Fair because you're our best science student.
58,21,8,Heidi Turner,So now I'm gonna be punished by being force to judge a bunch of handicapped kids?!
59,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"But... Okay, you see, the problem is that you volunteered last month, Heidi. You said you wanted to do it, m'kay?"
60,21,8,Heidi Turner,Well how can you expect students to commit to things a month in advance?! [puts away a stray lock of hair under her cap] I don't even know what I want for dinner tonight.
61,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Look, the kids have worked really hard and have done some amazing projects."
62,21,8,Heidi Turner,You're gonna force me to come to skewl on a Saturday?!
63,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Heidi, eh... is everything all right?"
64,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Oh what? Are you gonna call me fat now too?! It just so happens I'm a vegan, which means it'd difficult for me to get enough protein, so my body doesn't burn fat, it burns muscle, which makes it look like I'm fat, but I'm actually WAY healthier than any of YOU!!"
65,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Heidi, you're judging the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend."
66,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Oh, Goddammit!"
67,21,8,Nathan,[looks around] Mimsy! Come on! [reaches the door]
68,21,8,Mimsy,Okay Nathan. [joins him]
69,21,8,Nathan,"Shhh, shut the fuck up! [picks the lock and opens the door. They go in, look around, then go to Jimmy and Timmy's project]"
70,21,8,Mimsy,"Gee, we could get in a lot of trouble. Ya, you sure we should mess with Jimmy and Timmy's science fair project?"
71,21,8,Nathan,"Mimsy, do you know what Jimmy is? He's a cock blocker."
72,21,8,Mimsy,Eh what's a cock blocker?
73,21,8,Nathan,"Every time I come up with a way to score with the ladies, there's Jimmy tryin' to one-up me. This science fair is supposed to finally make us successful enough to get chicks."
74,21,8,Mimsy,"D'aw, gee, I don't know if we should use our position of power to exploit women."
75,21,8,Nathan,"... [smacks Mimsy] I'm not letting those assholes win the science fair! [opens a medical bag] That's why I say, the only good water bears are dead water bears. [pulls out a bottle of lighter fluid and pours it into the tardigrade tank, then follows that up with a bottle of lye. He then gets a curling iron, plugs it in and turns it on, and sticks it into the tank, where it sparks and causes a chemical reaction] Let's go! [they run out of the bungalow as the reaction continues inside]"
76,21,8,Heidi Turner,This is bullcrap! How can they force me to be the science fair judge?! Now I know how it feels to be a slave!
77,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"It's... not exactly like being a slave, Heidi."
78,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Yes it is! Am I being paid to judge the science fair? No. Do I have a choice? No. ""Ohhh, yes masah. Lemme judge that science fair for ya, suh!"""
79,21,8,Theresa,"God, will you stop?!"
80,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Theresa, don't get all aggro on me because you're pissed off your family lives in a trailer."
81,21,8,Theresa,My family doesn't live in a trailer. We live in a tiny home. My parents downsized to make a smaller footprint on the environment.
82,21,8,Heidi Turner,That's what I said. Your family lives in a trailer.
83,21,8,Theresa,There's lots of progressive people living in tiny homes. There's five others on my block.
84,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Right. That's called a ""trailer park."""
85,21,8,Theresa,A-hi don't live in a trailer park!
86,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"[to Theresa, about Heidi] Just don't even respond to her. Just ignore her."
87,21,8,Heidi Turner,"I'll try, but she's such a bitch."
88,21,8,Isla,"She wasn't talking to you, Heidi."
89,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Oh, looks like Isla has something to say, you guys. Hold on, I'm sure this is going to be really profound. Go ahead, Isla, knock us out with you wit and satire. This should be good, you guys."
90,21,8,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Heidi] Hey Heidi, what's up?"
91,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[uninterested] Oh hey babe, what's going on?"
92,21,8,Eric Cartman,What are you up to?
93,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[her voice trails off] Nothiiing, just talking to my girlfriends about tiny homes."
94,21,8,Nathan,"Well hello there, ladies."
95,21,8,Nelly,"Oh, hi Nathan."
96,21,8,Nathan,We just wanted to remind you [hand Nichole a flyer] that this weekend is the Special Ed Science Fair.
97,21,8,Nichole Daniels,"Oh, cool."
98,21,8,Nathan,"Yeah, that's right. Pretty soon you'll all be impressed with what you see. Hope you can make it. [walks off with Mimsy. Moments later...] Did you see that, Mimsy? The way those girls bit their bottom lips when I said ""science fair""? We're about to be drowning in muff."
99,21,8,Francis,"Nathan! Mimallah! Yuh, you've gotta get to Special Ed!"
100,21,8,Nathan,Special Ed class isn't for another two hours.
101,21,8,Francis,"Nono, you've gotta see this! Jimmy and Timmy's water bears! They've changed!"
102,21,8,Nathan,What?
103,21,8,Counselor Steve,"Jimmy and Timmy, this is incredible! You've somehow made them even smarter. [Francis, Nathan and Mimsy enter]"
104,21,8,Nathan,What's goin' on?
105,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Nathan, it's amazing. The water bears we've trained are starting to display social advancements."
106,21,8,Mimsy,But they're supposed to be dead. [Nathan smacks him]
107,21,8,Nathan,[walks up to Jimmy and Timmy's table] What social advancement?
108,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,They've actually evolved to the point of doing the hokey pokey.
109,21,8,Nathan,"The hokey pokey? [looks down into the microscope and sees the tardigrades. ""The Hokey Pokey"" plays as the water bears begin synchronized dancing] You've gotta be fucking kidding me."
110,21,8,Counselor Steve,"Boys, this might be the single greatest Special Ed Science Fair project I've ever seen!"
111,21,8,Heidi Turner,Butters.
112,21,8,Butters Stotch,Whoa. [turns around] Uh hey.
113,21,8,Heidi Turner,How would you like to be the judge for the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend?
114,21,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhh, I can't. I'm going to a birthday party."
115,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, don't be a dick!"
116,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, don't make up excuses because judging handicapped students sounds terrible!"
117,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Butters! God! [rolls his eyes]"
118,21,8,Clyde Donovan,[walks up to Heidi and Cartman] He's not making it up. It's my birthday party.
119,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair."
120,21,8,Stan Marsh,[walks into view with Kyle] What's wrong with supporting them? They're our friends.
121,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Because nobody wants to be trapped, in a gym, with Special Ed Science."
122,21,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Actually, some of their projects are pretty cool."
123,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle! [to each other] Samesies! [they kiss each other on the lips]"
124,21,8,and Heidi,"Shut up, Kyle! [to each other] Samesies! [they kiss each other on the lips]"
125,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Look, it's all just a complete waste of time! It's not like the Special Ed Science Fair is actually gonna contribute to society. [a helicopter is heard over the school. In front of the school, the helicopter lands on the lawn as several black cars and vans roll up to the school. A bunch of men in black suits get out of the vehicles and walk into school]"
126,21,8,Jerry Jones,"[leading the men] Move. Move aside, kids. Official business!"
127,21,8,An NFL owner,"Move it, children. [the kids make way for the NFL owners]"
128,21,8,PC Principal,"Excuse me, can I help you?"
129,21,8,Jerry Jones,We understand that you're about to have a science fair with some very interesting experiments.
130,21,8,PC Principal,"That's right, the science fair is this Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm."
131,21,8,Jerry Jones,We're here to help however we can. Your special ed department has all our resources and all our support. This science fair... just might be what saves us all.
132,21,8,Heidi Turner,"What the hell is going on?! Everywhere I turn, people are being given handouts while I'm forced to work my ass off! It's total bullshit!"
133,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun?"
134,21,8,Heidi Turner,[stops pacing] Relax?! How can I relax?! I get straight A's! I ace every test! And who gets all the support?! The Special Ed Department!
135,21,8,Jerry Jones,Good. Bring it on in. These kids need to have access to everything they need.
136,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, look at this, Tim-Tim. They've all been researching water bears too."
137,21,8,Jerry Jones,"That's correct. [two workers roll up a whiteboard with a diagram of a tardigrade on it, with parts of the body clearly labeled] Like you, we've come to realize that water bears are the key to our future. [walks up to the project right after Jimmy and Timmy do] Are these the special water bears that we read about on your school message board?"
138,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,That's right. The water bears we've been working with appear to be evolving somehow.
139,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Then they are the key to our survival, boys."
140,21,8,Nathan,"Gentlemen, perhaps I can interest you in a lava volcano. You won't believe your eyes when I add some simple baking soda."
141,21,8,Jerry Jones,"[turns to face him] There's no time for that! We need everyone working on Jimmy and Timmy's project. I'm gonna let you kids all in on a little secret. We don't wanna create a panic, but... the End is very near. And we have very little time."
142,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Fellow students, I have asked to speak today because of the hypocrisy and bullying that is coming from the administration at this so called... skewl. It is an outrage that our principal and counselor denand our participation in privileged programs that are outrageously overfunded. Why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to special needs students? Are the rest of us not special? If we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs, then soon we will all be poor, and forced to live in a trailer park like Theresa."
143,21,8,Theresa,It's not a trailer!
144,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Theresa, [that lock of hair comes down again] get over it, you live in a trailer park, it's not a big deal. [she puts the lock back in place]"
145,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie."
146,21,8,Heidi Turner,What did you say?!
147,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with."
148,21,8,Heidi Turner,GET THIS OVER WITH?! You're supposed to be supporting me!
149,21,8,Eric Cartman,"I am supporting you, sweetheart!"
150,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Being supportive doesn't mean you criticize me, asshole! Just forget it! My point is, if the school administration doesn't cancel the science fair, I will see to it that they are all fired for discrimination!"
151,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"[standing by the gym doors, to PC Principal] She's... kind of like Cartman, but with the ability to follow through."
152,21,8,PC Principal,"Oh, dude. Bro."
153,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Francis, can you hand me the sound wave generator? [Frances hands it to him]"
154,21,8,Nathan,This is bullshit! The Special Ed Science Fair is turning into a lovefest for Jimmy and Timmy's project! They're gonna get all the fame and glory!
155,21,8,Mimsy,"D'aw, I guess we kind of shot ourselves in the foot, huh boss? If it weren't for us, those water bears wouldn't have even gotten smarter in the first place."
156,21,8,Nathan,"[stops and thinks] Hey, Mimsy, that's right. They don't deserve the credit, we do. [speaks up] Uh, excuse me. If you're all trying to figure out why these water bears are different, you're talking to the wrong guys. [Everyone turns to face him]"
157,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Wha-what do you mean, Nathan?"
158,21,8,Nathan,Mimsy and I did some experimenting with the water bears on our own.
159,21,8,Mimsy,We was tryin' to kill 'em. [smack]
160,21,8,Nathan,"It was us who made them evolve, so we should be the ones working for the government."
161,21,8,Jerry Jones,The government? Wuh we aren't the government.
162,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,Yuh you're not the government? But you said you were here to help stop us from becoming extinct.
163,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Not you, us. We're with... the NFL. Our fans are leaving at an exponential rate. We've been hit with anthem protests, protests of those protests, and worst of all, concussions. The more reports that come out, the more people are getting turned off by football. We've been experimenting with water bears because... we believe they are our last hope."
164,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, I get it. You've been experimenting with water bears to see how to make humans more impervious to concussions."
165,21,8,Jerry Jones,No. We've been experimenting with water bears to try and make them... FANS.
166,21,8,Sportscaster 1,A beautiful night for football here in Los Angeles as the Chargers take on the Buffalo Bills.
167,21,8,Sportscaster 2,"And a record sellout crowd here at the stadium. Football clearly more popular than over with a whopping 17 million in attendance. [shown are a smattering of fans, with the rest of the seats being occupied by small tanks of tardigrades]"
168,21,8,Sportscaster 1,"The NFL, of course, working really hard to reach new viewers, and it looks like they found their answer in tardigrades."
169,21,8,Sportscaster 2,"[a camera crew focuses on one tank] The water bears are thrilled to be here and of course, love seeing themselves on the Jumbotron. [which shows that tank's sea bears onscreen] They're all ready for some football and enjoying the fan favorite Kiss Cam. [two tardigrades are shown kissing]"
170,21,8,Sportscaster 1,And we're ready for kickoff as the cheers of 17 million fans rock the stadium! [the Chargers kick off and the Bills catch the football and begin their charge. Nothing but crickets are heard as a Bills player is taken down]
171,21,8,Jerry Jones,We're running out of time. We have to see if these water bears truly are different. Insert the box. [a fellow owner grabs a microscopic box with tweezers and carries it over to the table. He puts it into the specimen slide] Gently. What do you see now? [the tweezers are removed]
172,21,8,Nathan,"Ahhh, Iii see the box. [a microscopic FedEx box] What, what's in the box?"
173,21,8,Jerry Jones,What are the water bears doing?
174,21,8,Nathan,"Uhhh, they're just walkin' around and ubb, oh wait! They appear to be interested in the box."
175,21,8,Jerry Jones,"These water bears are different. [the classroom door opens and in walk Heidi, Cartman, Mr. Mackey and PC Principal]"
176,21,8,PC Principal,"All right, everyone, listen up. Give me your attention please. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we are cancelling the Special Ed Science Fair. [the students begin to talk amongst themselves]"
177,21,8,Owners,What? Cancelling?
178,21,8,Jerry Jones,You can't cancel the science fair. We're on the verge of a breakthrough here.
179,21,8,Heidi Turner,It's cancelled. You guys can get all this shit out of here and leave. Thank you!
180,21,8,Jerry Jones,You don't understand! The Special Ed Science Fair is our only hope!
181,21,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh I'm sorry, but um, our hands are tied... by Heidi. [Jones and the other owners whip out their guns]"
182,21,8,Jerry Jones,I think you all fail to see the seriousness of our situation! Football is dying!
183,21,8,Mr Mackey,"[he and PC Principal put their hands up] Whoa, whoa whoa, okay."
184,21,8,Jerry Jones,[to another owner] Close the door! [the owner closes the door] Everyone back to work! Nobody... [two special ed kids and Cartman slip out of view] will stop this Special Ed Science Fair!
185,21,8,Another owner,[with his gun aimed at Nathan] Do what he says!
186,21,8,Nathan,"Oh! Uh okay, Jesus Christ!"
187,21,8,Heidi Turner,[finds Cartman] Are you just gonna stand there?! Do something!
188,21,8,Eric Cartman,What the hell do you want me to do?!
189,21,8,Heidi Turner,I want you to have some BALLS and act like you care about me!
190,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch!"
191,21,8,Heidi Turner,[gets closer to him] Call me a bitch again! Do it! [gets in his face] Call me a bitch again!
192,21,8,Eric Cartman,You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend.
193,21,8,Heidi Turner,That's what I thought!
194,21,8,Nathan,"Hey, uh wait a minute! The water bears have changed again. I think it's working."
195,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Let me see that! [looks through the microscope] Yes. Yes, they're starting to adapt. [the water bears now sport jerseys from various teams. He increases the magnification] Sonofabitch, we just might have ourselves some fans! [stands up] Now quickly, children! We must replicate these water bears to create more! [Nathan gets back on the microscope]"
196,21,8,Heidi Turner,"If nobody else is going to do anything, I will! [runs up to the microscope, yanks the fish bowl from it, and runs to the door]"
197,21,8,Nathan,Wha-ah?
198,21,8,An owner,The water bears!
199,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?!"
200,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Move it! Get the fuck out of the way! I said get out of the way, you assholes! [followiong are the NFL owners, the special ed kids, Mr. Mackey and PC Principal, ...and Cartman]"
201,21,8,Another owner,"We got the fat girl, front of the school."
202,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Shit! [turns around and goes back inside, only to see all the people chasing her down]"
203,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Little girl, stop! [Heidi begins to pant] It doesn't have to end this way."
204,21,8,Eric Cartman,"[makes his way to the front of the group] Move aside! Move aside! [finally sees Heidi] Heidi, seriously, you need to listen to me!"
205,21,8,Heidi Turner,I don't... have to listen... to anybody!
206,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes, yes you do! You need to listen!"
207,21,8,Heidi Turner,Fuck you!
208,21,8,Eric Cartman,"No, fuck you!"
209,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Little girl, please! What you have in your hand is very special."
210,21,8,Heidi Turner,Well I'm sick of everyone treating me like shit!
211,21,8,Jerry Jones,Think about the NFL. How much joy it brings to everyone!
212,21,8,Nathan,Don't listen to them. Give the water bears to me. I deserve all the fame and bitches.
213,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry."
214,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Look, if you- if you don't do it for the NFL, what about humanity? Those creatures are showing the first signs of sentience. Think about what they could mean for science. For medicine. Making people better."
215,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Come on, babe. We all want the old Heidi back. [Heidi looks up at the balcony and notices Wendy, Theresa, and Isla looking down upon her]"
216,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[looks down at the water bears, then looks up again] Screw all you guys!"
217,21,8,NFL Owners,"NOOOO! [Heidi chugs the fish bowl down like a college student, wipes her lips, then burps]"
218,21,8,Special Ed kids,"NOOOO! [Heidi chugs the fish bowl down like a college student, wipes her lips, then burps]"
219,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, wwow."
220,21,8,Heidi Turner,[angrily] Is there something you wanna talk about?
221,21,8,Eric Cartman,"No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence."
222,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Whatever. It's Saturday, and I'm not in skewl."
223,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl."
224,21,8,Heidi Turner,[goes back to eating chips] How come we never snuggle anymore?!
225,21,8,Eric Cartman,"[alarmed] Wha, what?"
226,21,8,Heidi Turner,We used to snuggle all the time and it's totally gone away! What happened?!
227,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, but honey, we still-"
228,21,8,Heidi Turner,SNUGGLE!
229,21,8,Eric Cartman,"[gets closer to her] Yes yes, let's, let's snuggle, yes. [she shares her blanket and snuggles]"
230,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Goddammit, how come there's nothin' to watch on Saturday but kids cartoons?!"
231,21,8,Blue Horse on TV,"Hohall right, kids. Now let's do the hokey pokey. [begins to sing the song]"
232,21,8,Heidi Turner,Oooo. [her belly begins to move to the music] What's goin' on in here?
233,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, what is goin' on in here?"
234,21,8,Heidi Turner,I feel somethin' moving around. I-it- [farts]
235,21,8,Eric Cartman,Yeesh. [backs away]
236,21,8,Heidi Turner,[farts again] SNUGGLE!
237,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, honey. [gets close to her again, but she farts again] Eughah, ah."
238,21,8,Roger Goodell,"Well, did you have any luck, Mr. Jones?"
239,21,8,Jerry Jones,"I'm afraid, Commissioner, that the Special Ed Science Fair failed to produce more viable water bears."
240,21,8,Officlal 1,Then the NFL truly has no hope.
241,21,8,Officlal 2,We're done for.
242,21,8,Jerry Jones,Not quite. [a lab worker wheels something in and leaves] We were able to obtain somethin' else [picks up a beaker] that just might be our future. [pours the beaker into the volcano Nathan offered to him earlier]
