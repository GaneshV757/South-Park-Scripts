4,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Lookin' good, Ryan."
5,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"Yeah, I got a real cape this year. Check it out. [holds it up for the others to check out, and Gerald pulls away]"
6,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Hey Sharon, did you see the box of Jack Daniels?"
7,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh no, you're not doing this again."
8,21,6,Randy Marsh,What do you mean? Of course I am.
9,21,6,Sharon Marsh,Stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch.
10,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys."
11,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, and you guys get wasted."
12,21,6,Randy Marsh,"We have some drinks. Come on, all the other guys' wives aren't being bitchy about it."
13,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Sup, witches! [gets into the car]"
14,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Alright, Randy's got the JD!"
15,21,6,Randy Marsh,Yep. Who's got the other stuff.
16,21,6,Stuart McCormick,"Kevin said he's bringing it. [Randy chuckles, then the other men join in]"
17,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[Impatient, yet quiet] Come on, come on... [normal voice] Sweetheart, can we get going, please?"
18,21,6,Heidi Turner,"[from her closet] Hang on, babe. Just a couple more things. [tosses out random pieces of clothing]"
19,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?"
20,21,6,Heidi Turner,[dressed in a black spider suit and orange skirt with bats on it] What do you think?
21,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[urgently] Great, perfect. Let's go to the pumpkin patch."
22,21,6,Heidi Turner,Yup! Almost ready. [gets up on her chair and pulls out two items from her dresser]
23,21,6,Eric Cartman,Wha-what?
24,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Okay, spider or the bat?"
25,21,6,Eric Cartman,[getting exasperated] The spider's great.
26,21,6,Heidi Turner,Really? 'Cause I think I like the bat.
27,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[quietly, from the other side of her bed] Why does she do this every time?"
28,21,6,Heidi Turner,"What, babe?"
29,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[urgently] I said it's time. Boy, look at the time."
30,21,6,Heidi Turner,"'Kay, all set."
31,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[leaves the bedroom] 'Kay, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch."
32,21,6,Heidi Turner,[leaves the bedroom] Okay! Oh! I forgot my glitter lip gloss! [heads for the bathroom]
33,21,6,Eric Cartman,You don't need glitter lip gloss!
34,21,6,Heidi Turner,"[stops short of the bathroom, turns around and walks back] Eric, are you upset? Do you need to talk about something?"
35,21,6,Eric Cartman,"No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy!"
36,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Oh, okay. [heads back to the bathroom, and Cartman is dejected. Heidi looks back for a second] Hang on, I gotta pee. [closes the bathroom door]"
37,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome."
38,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Almost thought you guys were gonna bail on us.
39,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[chuckling] Yeah, right. We're gonna miss the first night of the party."
40,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Sup, Stephen, Chip."
41,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Just ready to party farty, witches. [holds up two six-packs of Samuel Adams beer]"
42,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Well, I got the Jack."
43,21,6,Thomas Tucker,[steps out of his truck with Steve] And I got the crack.
44,21,6,Randy Marsh,Oh yeah! Jack and Crack Witch Week! Let's do this!
45,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Everybody up the hill! [the men proceed up the hill, singing Wang Chung's ""Everybody Have Fun Tonight""]"
46,21,6,The Men,"Everybody have fun tonight
Jack and Crack Witch Week tonight

47,21,6,Mr Turner,"Thanks for taking the kids out tonight, Ms. Cartman. Heidi's been looking forward to it."
48,21,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh yes, my little Eric just loves the pumpkin patch. It's one of his favorite events of the year."
49,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, come on, let's go."
50,21,6,Liane Cartman,"All right, you kids all ready?"
51,21,6,Eric Cartman,[directing his comments at Heidi upstairs] Yup. All set to go to the pumpkin patch! It's been open for over an hour now! [Heidi finally comes down the stairs]
52,21,6,Nancy Turner,"Ohoh, don't you look cute, Heidi."
53,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[goes to the front door and opens it] Awesome. Here we go, heading out now!"
54,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Hold on, Eric. I want a picture."
55,21,6,Eric Cartman,"No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh-"
56,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Will you take a picture, dad?"
57,21,6,Eric Cartman,"See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh-"

59,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!"
60,21,6,Heidi Turner,Bye Daddy! Love you!
61,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[at the car door] 'Kay, here we go to the pumpkin patch!"
62,21,6,Heidi Turner,Oh crap. Hang on! I forgot my bracelet!
63,21,6,Eric Cartman,[in the car] Oh my fucking God!
64,21,6,Liane Cartman,"Eric, potty mouth."
65,21,6,Eric Cartman,Arrrrrrrrgh!
66,21,6,The Men,Put a spell on our bosses. Put a spell on our wives. A hex on the Patriots. Let's fuck up their lives!
67,21,6,Randy Marsh,And screw the Raiders too!
68,21,6,The Men,Yeah! [some time passes and they're getting wasted]
69,21,6,Randy Marsh,"No way. Check out Stephen, you guys."
70,21,6,Stephen Stotch,[walks around as if riding a broom] Heeheeheehee. Happy Witch Week! [falls to the ground face first] Ow. [the other men laugh at him.]
71,21,6,Chip Duncan,"[walks in with a book] Hey, HEY! [the partying stops] You guys wanna see some real witchcraft? [no one replies for a few seconds]"
72,21,6,Randy Marsh,Oooooooooooooo. [the men laugh]
73,21,6,Chip Duncan,"I mean it! I got this spell book last month. Got it in Salem, Massachusetts. They say it's real."
74,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Like real, how?"
75,21,6,Chip Duncan,Like from the Devil himself. You guys wanna try it?
76,21,6,The Men,Yeah.
77,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Hey, wait up, babe! [Cartman stops, closes his eyes, and stretches out his hand for Heidi to take when she catches up to him]"
78,21,6,Butters Stotch,"[walks by with his pumpkin and his mom] Hey, where you been, Eric?"
79,21,6,Scott Malkinson,Oh boy! What a great time that was.
80,21,6,Ticket taker,"Thanks for coming, kids. [sees Cartman and Heidi approaching] Oh, you just getting here?"
81,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we are just getting here."
82,21,6,Ticket taker,"Okay uh, go on in, I suppose. Petting zoo's closed, and I think they stopped the churro machine."
83,21,6,Eric Cartman,The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed?
84,21,6,Ticket taker,Yeah. You can still maybe do the bouncy house.
85,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Come on, babe!"
86,21,6,Chip Duncan,Arkna. Peduum. Uthnod boral.
87,21,6,Randy Marsh,That's pretty cool. [strikes up a crack pipe]
88,21,6,Chip Duncan,Uthnod boral! Uthnod alvernderaal! Wickus! [a green glow emanates from the book] Stayfalls-wuh. Uh.
89,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa."
90,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Ach. Oh, it burns!"
91,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Okay, Chip. You might need to ease up on that crack there, buddy. [Chip drops the book and screams, and begins to transform into an actual witch. A broom flies to him and he rides off on it, cackling]"
92,21,6,Chip Duncan,I'll kill you all! Kill you all!
93,21,6,Chip Duncan,[cackling] You'll all be dead by Halloween! [cackles some more]
94,21,6,Ticket taker,Get out! Everyone out!
95,21,6,Eric Cartman,What do you mean?! I just got here!
96,21,6,Ticket taker,There's a witch! [Chip flies in and starts bombing the patch]
97,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Come on, Eric!"
98,21,6,Eric Cartman,"No! I missed it! I missed it all! [Heidi pulls him away. Chip sees a boy, plucks him off the ground and carries him away]"
99,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh. Hey, didn't see you there."
100,21,6,Sharon Marsh,Did you hear anything about what happened last night?
101,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened?"
102,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Your buddy, Chip Duncan? [holds up her phone, on which there's a news report about it] Apparently, he flew around on a broom, blew things up, and kidnapped some children?"
103,21,6,Randy Marsh,Are you serious?!
104,21,6,Sharon Marsh,You heard nothing about this?! He flew away vowing we'd all be dead by Halloween!
105,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[hands her back the phone and walks off] God, I knew that guy was a fuckin' chode!"
106,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, what did you guys do at that party?"
107,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[turns around] Nothin'. We were just hangin' out and talkin' and stuff, and then Chip got all weird."
108,21,6,Sharon Marsh,People were hurt!
109,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch!"
110,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Did any of you guys actually see the witch?
111,21,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, it was terrifying. She had a broom and a cackle and everything."
112,21,6,Token Black,"What are we gonna do, guys?"
113,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around! [next to him, Cartman has an angry glare on his face]"
114,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that?
115,21,6,Stan Marsh,"No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early."
116,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. [the camera begins to focus on Cartman's glare]"
117,21,6,Stan Marsh,We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe.
118,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, but what are we gonna do?"
119,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No, we've got to just hope the police will handle it."
120,21,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, right. Like they'll handle anything. [from a nearby table, Heidi peeks past Bebe and smiles at Cartman, waving at him]"
121,21,6,Token Black,"Stan's right. This might fall on us. [Cartman waves back, his glare fixed on her]"
122,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric?"
123,21,6,Eric Cartman,[his concentration is broken] What?
124,21,6,Butters Stotch,We've got to do something to get rid of her!
125,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out."
126,21,6,Randy Marsh,"All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night."
127,21,6,Sharon Marsh,[displeased] Where do you think you're going?
128,21,6,Randy Marsh,What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys.
129,21,6,Sharon Marsh,[stands up] You can't possibly be considering doing this again!
130,21,6,Randy Marsh,Why not?
131,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don't think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!"
132,21,6,Randy Marsh,Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we're supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus! [turns around and walks out the front door]
133,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,Hey Randy.
134,21,6,Randy Marsh,Sup guys?
135,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches."
136,21,6,Randy Marsh,"I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy."
137,21,6,Stuart McCormick,It's like a witch pursuit thingy.
138,21,6,Randy Marsh,A witch uhhh-
139,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,It's a witch chase and shoot 'em up.
140,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, that's what it is!"
141,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"Hey, what the hell is this?"
142,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[reading the sign] ""Park closed until further notice"". That's bullshit!"
143,21,6,Stuart McCormick,Oh my God.
144,21,6,Randy Marsh,They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing!
145,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape."
146,21,6,Stan Marsh,What are bent pits? [Cartman walks in with some plans]
147,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey guys, I think I got it figured out."
148,21,6,Stan Marsh,You do?
149,21,6,Butters Stotch,"I knew Eric would come up with a plan! [Cartman puts up a drawing of his plan, which involves the boys luring Heidi to her death, burying the body, and celebrating her death with a pizza. He then brings out his retractable pointer and starts pointing]"
150,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-"
151,21,6,Stan Marsh,Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about?
152,21,6,Eric Cartman,This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi.
153,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody's talking about getting rid of Heidi!
154,21,6,Eric Cartman,You guys said you would help me get rid of her!
155,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,OF THE WITCH!
156,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys!"
157,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Then break up with her! You clearly can't stand her! LET THE POOR GIRL GO!
158,21,6,Eric Cartman,I've tried! It's impossible!
159,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?!
160,21,6,Eric Cartman,"You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle! [Kyle just stares angrily at him] Fine. Just leave me to suffer. Next time you want me to kill someone for you, just forget about it! [leaves the room]"
161,21,6,Mayor McDaniels,"Students and parents, I know that you are all concerned about the witch who is preying upon our town, and I wanna speak to you all about how to try and protect yourselves. But first, some gentlemen have asked to speak on what they perceive to be a [does air quotes] ""witch pursuit thing"". [walks off the stage as the gentlemen in costume get on stage and arrange themselves around the mic]"
162,21,6,Richard Tweak,"Oh wait, I'm supposed to be-"
163,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, sure, no. [to Stuart] You go over there."
164,21,6,Stuart McCormick,Right. Right right right. [music starts and they begin singing]
165,21,6,The Men,"We're all on the same side, you and I.
Let's all stick togetha, let's try.
When things are going bad and there's people you need to confront.
Just be sure it doesn't turn into a witch pursuit thing."
166,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"[as the other men provide ambient harmony] Hey guys, there's good witches and there's bad witches, and we stand with you in saying this particular witch needs to be brought down. But that doesn't men we should all be closing parks and stopping all witch activity because [catches up with the others on vocals]"
167,21,6,The Men,Let's not turn this into a witch pursuit thing.
168,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Gerald] Dad, get out of here! We're trying to deal with an actual witch! Nobody's coming after you!"
169,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Yes they are, boys! And next they'll be coming after you! 'Cause you're all little sons a witches!"
170,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"Right. You don't have to worry about us, going around snatching children. Only the other witch does that. [Cartman's face lights up and he looks at Heidi. He gets a mischievous look in his eyes]"
171,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, babe."
172,21,6,Heidi Turner,Oh. Hey Eric.
173,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say?"
174,21,6,Heidi Turner,A costume party? With everything that's going on?
175,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out."
176,21,6,Heidi Turner,Well... I guess.
177,21,6,Eric Cartman,Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.
178,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Well, maybe make it 4:30 if you're bringing the costumes. [Cartman turns left and walks away] I might need a little extra time getting ready."
179,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[stops, then mischievously] Ohohoh, I'm counting on it. [walks off]"
180,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Randy, can I talk to you?"
181,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Sure, Stephen."
182,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives."
183,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[quickly closes the door and walks up to Stephen] Okay, look. You're freaked out, it's understandable."
184,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first."
185,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun."
186,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming?
187,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy."
188,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience."
189,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[sighs] All right, Stephen. At least give us till tomorrow morning to talk to our wives and prepare them, all right? Can you just give us till morning?"
190,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah, sure. [walks to the front door] I'm sorry."
191,21,6,Randy Marsh,"It's okay. It's okay. [Stephen leaves. A few second later, Randy is on the phone calling up someone] Hey, it's Randy. We’ve got until tomorrow morning to sacrifice Stephen to the Devil. I'll explain later, just get everyone together. And, maybe bring just a little bit of crack."
192,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Don't you think we should stay on the main roads, Eric? This seems like a bad place to be right now."
193,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party. [loudly] I'm sure the witch won't even notice us."
194,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Eric, come on, this is a bad idea. Let's turn around."
195,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready."
196,21,6,Heidi Turner,"[sensing the sarcasm] Is that what this is about? You're still mad about the pumpkin patch, aren't you?"
197,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch."
198,21,6,Heidi Turner,"I didn't use the bathroom 40 times! [Chip is heard above them] What was that? [the leaves in the trees rustle and she looks up] Eric! Did you hear that?! [she turns to see him, but he's gone] Eric?! Eric! Oh my God! Eric, are you okay?!"
199,21,6,Chip Duncan,"[finally appears] Well, well. What have we here?"
200,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[barely above a whisper, hiding behind a fallen tree trunk] Sweet. Come on, come on."
201,21,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, is your dad home?"
202,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I, I don't know where he is."
203,21,6,Stan Marsh,We can't find our dads either.
204,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group."
205,21,6,Stan Marsh,"We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens."
206,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,How are we gonna do that?
207,21,6,Stan Marsh,There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while.
208,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Who?
209,21,6,President s Aide,"[opens the door and looks in] Mr. President, you have an urgent call from a Butters Stotch?"
210,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"[lost in thought, he perks up] Butters? What's he want? [picks up the phone at his desk] This is the President."
211,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you?"
212,21,6,Stan Marsh,"[in Butters' room with Kyle and Kenny] Butter him up, Butters."
213,21,6,Butters Stotch,"How uh, how is runnin' the country going?"
214,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, it's fine. You know, just makin' the country great again."
215,21,6,Butters Stotch,Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said?
216,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"I got rid of like, six of 'em so far. You know, it's a little harder than I thought."
217,21,6,Butters Stotch,Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build?
218,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Don't be a dick, Butters. Are you just callin' to shit on my Halloween?"
219,21,6,Butters Stotch,"N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads?"
220,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Yeah, it was my favorite time of year. Now I just have to celebrate it alone."
221,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all."
222,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Lemme guess: Chip Duncan. Oh, that guy was always such a douche."
223,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches."
224,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Comin' after all witches? Oh, Jeez..."
225,21,6,Sgt Yates,So you were there when the witch showed up and took your girlfriend.
226,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late."
227,21,6,Sgt Yates,What was your girlfriend wearing?
228,21,6,Eric Cartman,"She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany."
229,21,6,Rick,And you didn't stop at all to think that what you were doing might attract a witch?
230,21,6,Eric Cartman,Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!
231,21,6,Rick,"No, I'm just saying that if there's a big fat witch around, maybe you shouldn't walk around in the woods dressed as Hansel and Gretel."
232,21,6,Eric Cartman,Ohhhhh!
233,21,6,Sgt Yates,"Whoa, whoa, not cool, Rick. Not cool."
234,21,6,Eric Cartman,"I will have your badge, sir!"
235,21,6,Sgt Yates,"[looks towards the camera] Sorry folks, sorry."
236,21,6,Cop 1,Detective! Detective! Call just came in. The witch has been spotted at Ross Dress For Less.
237,21,6,Sgt Yates,"Everyone to Ross Dress For Less, now!"
238,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about?
239,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Hello, Stephen."
240,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for?"
241,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children."
242,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"What? What uh, What are you doing?"
243,21,6,Steve Black,"[accompanied by Stuart] Here he is, everybody! Stephen's a bad witch!"
244,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Nooo! [people begin to gather around the witches]
245,21,6,Randy Marsh,"We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do!"
246,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Oh my God! I see what this is! This witch pursuit thing has you on a witch pursuit thing now! [several police cars pull into the parking lot and officers pour out of them] I'm innocent. Please!
247,21,6,Sgt Yates,"It's over, Stotch. What have you done with the children?"
248,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Noho, don't you see?! They're just doing their own witch pursuit thingy now! This is madness! [Chip is heard cackling from up in the air. Everyone looks up to see him flying over Ross Dress For Less, then hug their kids to keep them safe]"
249,21,6,Chip Duncan,"[lands and gets off the broom] Hey, what's up, bros?"
250,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"""What's up, bros?"" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused?"
251,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Yeah, so? I'm a witch."
252,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right?"
253,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Of course they do. You're all witches too, dudes!"
254,21,6,Steve Black,Not like you!
255,21,6,Stuart McCormick,What'd you do with the children?
256,21,6,Chip Duncan,They're all in here! See? [opens his bag]
257,21,6,Kids,"[voices heard while light emanates from the depth of the bag] Daddy, help! Mommy, help! Ahh!"
258,21,6,Chip Duncan,I'm going to use their souls to increase my power!
259,21,6,A townsman,Look! Another witch is flying down now! [a shot of Air Force One flying towards town]
260,21,6,Stan Marsh,"Butters, come on! We've gotta go!"
261,21,6,Butters Stotch,Okay! Where?
262,21,6,Stan Marsh,"I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere!"
263,21,6,Butters Stotch,Holy moly! [leaves his chair and follows the others out]
264,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out."
265,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Oh, give me a break, Randy."
266,21,6,Randy Marsh,"No, seriously."
267,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Like if one of you guys had the power I have, you wouldn't use it."
268,21,6,Randy Marsh,No we wouldn't!
269,21,6,Herbert Garrison,Excuse me. [makes his way to the front of the group]
270,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Oh, hey man!"
271,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"You're ruining the party for everyone, Chip! I'm here to take you out!"
272,21,6,Chip Duncan,[cackles] You'll never stop me! [levitates] I grow more powerful every moment!
273,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"You wanna see real power? [into his pocket mic disguised as a lapel pin] All right, take the shot. [a solar-powered satellite takes aim at the President's location with three beeps, and two lasers shoot down towards it. The shot obliterates Chip, but his bag and broom fall away unscathed. A few moments of stunned silence, and the witches celebrate as Garrison fist-pumps. Two officers quickly come up and open the bag]"
274,21,6,Peter,[pops out of the bag] I'm free! [two girls pop out]
275,21,6,A girl,Mommy! Daddy! [the boy Chip plucked first pops out of the bag]
276,21,6,Sgt Yates,Is that all of them?
277,21,6,Cop 2,"There's one more little girl. Come on out, little girl."
278,21,6,Heidi Turner,Okay. Just a second.
279,21,6,Cop 2,"Com- come on, little girl. Everyone's waitin' on ya."
280,21,6,Heidi Turner,Okay. Almost ready. Hang on.
281,21,6,Eric Cartman,[sighs] It's gonna be a while.
282,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, we did it, guys."
283,21,6,Ryan Valmer,Everyone will be stoked on us now.
284,21,6,Randy Marsh,Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.
285,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Everybody follow me! I've got tons of Jack, tons of crack, and a jet! [the other witches cheer and follow him to the jet]"
286,21,6,The Men,"Party's back on! We did it, guys!"
287,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[looks back at Sharon] Don't wait up, Sharon! I'm gonna party with El Presidente. [Sharon and remaining townspeople are mad]"
288,21,6,Heidi Turner,All ready to trick or treat?
289,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[bored] Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now."
