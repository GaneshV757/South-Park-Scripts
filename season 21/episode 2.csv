0,21,2,PC Principal,"[taps the mic six times] All right everyone, listen up. Today we're gonna have a performance by one of our students who has written a song. The song is about his feelings towards the current political climate with North Korea. Put your hands together for Tweek. [the kids applaud, PC Principal exits stage left, and Tweek approaches the piano from stage right with some sheet music. He sets up the music and gets ready to play. He plays some angry, jarring notes on the piano as he screams]"
1,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"We're all gonna die! They have nuclear missiles! Wuh! Waaaa! Why are you just sitting there, doing nothing?! [stops playing and faces the audience] We have to get out of here! North Korea wants to kill us all and our President keeps making it worse! [walks to the front of the stage] Why are you just sitting there?! [returns to the piano and resumes playing] Why are you all acting like nothing's wrooong?! North Korea is going to bomb us! We are all dead! [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We have to do something! Do something! Do something! [screams, leaves the piano, and exits stage right]"
2,21,2,PC Principal,"[returns to the stage] All right. Next up we have Hannah Williams with her rendition of ""Wheels On The Bus."" [she enters from stage right looking back at Tweek. PC Principal hands her the mic]"
3,21,2,Hannah Williams,[emotional] The wheels on the bus go round and round...
4,21,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school."
5,21,2,Craig Tucker,What am I supposed to do?
6,21,2,Stan Marsh,"He's your boyfriend, dude."
7,21,2,Craig Tucker,He's not gonna listen to me. He never does when he's emotional.
8,21,2,Eric Cartman,"[lunching on chicken nuggets and fries] Craig, let me tall you about relationships, okay? [eats a fry] If you don't have some fuckin' balls, you're not gonna get anywhere. Doesn't matter if they're gay balls or straight balls. If you don't take control of your side of the relationship, you get walked all over-!"
9,21,2,Heidi Turner,"[approaching] Hey babe, how are you doin'?"
10,21,2,Eric Cartman,"[suddenly disinterested] Oh hey baby, what's going on? [Stan, Craig, Kyle, and Butters take turns glancing at each other]"
11,21,2,Heidi Turner,We still on for recess?
12,21,2,Eric Cartman,"Yep, I'll be there"
13,21,2,Heidi Turner,"'K babe, love you. [walks away. Craig is stunned at what just happened]"
14,21,2,Butters Stotch,I thought you said you broke up with Heidi.
15,21,2,Eric Cartman,I decided to give her one more chance.
16,21,2,Token Black,But you said she was mentally abusive.
17,21,2,Eric Cartman,She is mentally abusive.
18,21,2,Butters Stotch,So then why did you take her back?
19,21,2,Eric Cartman,"Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like ""I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God."" The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do?"
20,21,2,Tweek Tweak,AAAH!
21,21,2,Craig Tucker,[approaches] Tweek.
22,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"[startled, turns to face him] AAAH!"
23,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Dude, come on, you've gotta settle down."
24,21,2,Tweek Tweak,I can't settle down! We're all gonna die!
25,21,2,Craig Tucker,"[calmly] We're not all gonna die, you're overreacting. Everything's fine, okay?"
26,21,2,Tweek Tweak,[hears a tweet and pulls out his phone. Now frantic] Oh God! The President tweeted that North Korea doesn't have the guts to attack us! Why would he say that?! He's making everything worse!
27,21,2,Craig Tucker,Tweek-
28,21,2,Tweek Tweak,But North Koreans are gonna think we all agree with the President!
29,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Okay, so how about you write your Congressman a letter?"
30,21,2,Tweek Tweak,...That won't help anything! North Korea wants us dead!
31,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Okay, so write a letter to the North Koreans."
32,21,2,Tweek Tweak,I can't write in Korean and they all think we're war-hungry anyway!
33,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Okay, well why don't you just send something nice to the North Koreans?"
34,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Errrrg!
35,21,2,Craig Tucker,"It will make you feel better, babe."
36,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"Send something, like what?"
37,21,2,Craig Tucker,"I don't know, like... make some croissants or something?"
38,21,2,Tweek Tweak,I don't know how to make croissants!
39,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Well, what do you know how to make?"
40,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"Uunnggc, [slowly] cupcakes?"
41,21,2,Craig Tucker,"All right, go home and make some cupcakes, honey."
42,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Okay. [turns and heads out. Craig watches him leave]
43,21,2,Heidi Turner,Hey Stan?
44,21,2,Stan Marsh,[looks back at her] Yeah?
45,21,2,Heidi Turner,Can I talk to you about Eric?
46,21,2,Stan Marsh,Cartman? Okay.
47,21,2,Heidi Turner,I just wanna make sure he's all right.
48,21,2,Stan Marsh,What do you mean?
49,21,2,Heidi Turner,"I don't even know if I should be saying this, but, Eric said he was thinking about killing himself."
50,21,2,Stan Marsh,[stunned] What??
51,21,2,Heidi Turner,"We broke up, and he called saying he was about to do it. I'm still really scared for him."
52,21,2,Stan Marsh,Wait. Cartman said he was going to kill himself?
53,21,2,Heidi Turner,I'll send you the voice mail if you promise to keep it private.
54,21,2,Stan Marsh,Totally.
55,21,2,Stan Marsh,Shhh. [plays the voice message Heidi sent him]
56,21,2,Eric Cartman,"""You have to take me back! You have to! I'm gonna kill myself, Heidi!"" [the boys laugh a bit] ""I'm gonna kill myself and then you'll be sorry! You'll wish you could have me back, but I'll be deeaad."" [the boys laugh again. Cartman is nearby with his back to them and his arms crossed over his chest, upset that his threats are being heard by the guys.] ""Please, Heidi, please!"" [the boys laugh again.]"
57,21,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!"
58,21,2,Kyle Broflovski,[wipes away a tear from his laughter] You sound like a dying pig.
59,21,2,Eric Cartman,[faces the boys] That's great! I'm glad you guys think suicide is so funny! [the boys roar with laughter]
60,21,2,PC Principal,"Entree. [Cartman enters and takes a seat, crossing his arms again and looking to his left] Yes, Eric, how can I help you?"
61,21,2,Eric Cartman,"I don't think kids at this school take [looks at PC Principal] suicide seriously enough, and we need to raise awareness!"
62,21,2,PC Principal,"Well, unfortunately, this week is Distracted Driving Awareness Week at school, so you might have a hard time."
63,21,2,Eric Cartman,Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?
64,21,2,PC Principal,A lot of people. There's more deaths now because of people on their phones while driving than ever before.
65,21,2,Eric Cartman,"PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do."
66,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Huh? Oh. [taps on the screen and a video pops up]
67,21,2,Anchor 1,"A young homosexual boy known only as Tweek has touched the hearts of many by sending cupcakes to the North Korean government. [a shot of Tweek trembling] The little rascal apparently made a dent with the North Korean dictator, who is said to have loved the cupcakes so much that he started to make his own. [A shot of Kim Jong-un watching the cupcake dough stream out of a machine]"
68,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, ahhh. [smiles. A tweet notification is heard] Huh? [BREAKING NEWS] U.S. President responds to cupcakes. [taps on the notification and another video pops up]"
69,21,2,Anchor 2,"The human interest cupcake story has apparently been heard by the President. Just moments ago, the President tweeted ""I know that kid Tweek. He's fucking with you, North Korea. Get a clue. I'll bet he took a dump in the batter."""
70,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"D""AAAAH! WHAT?? WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?!"
71,21,2,Craig Tucker,"[walks into the kitchen just in time] Tweek, calm down."
72,21,2,Tweek Tweak,The President! He tweeted about me! Why would he do that?! Did you see that?!
73,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Yes, I did see that, so I went and got you something to make things better."
74,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Wwwhat?
75,21,2,Craig Tucker,[whips something out of his jacket pocket and shows him] It's a fidget spinner. It's supposed to help with anxiety. [spins it on his finger] See?
76,21,2,Tweek Tweak,...A fidget spinner?? Did you read what the President tweeted?? [another video pops up]
77,21,2,Anchor 3,"The President of the United States just tweeted again, this time saying ""I hope ALL children of America will stand with Tweek in saying 'GO AHEAD AND BOMB US, KIM JONG DONG, WE FUCKING DARE YOU!'"""
78,21,2,Tweek Tweak,[freaking out] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
79,21,2,Gary Borkovec,Hey guys. Take a minute to read about distracted driving? [a passing boy takes a flier]
80,21,2,Lola,Talk to all the grownups you know about staying off their mobile devices when they get behind the wheel.
81,21,2,Gary Borkovec,Hey guys. Got a second to help stop distracted driving? [another boy takes a flier] Thanks.
82,21,2,Lola,Hey guys- [music begins to play over the intercom]
83,21,2,Eric Cartman,"[over the intercom] Hey guys, let's take a minute and talk about suicide prevention. There's probably someone right now at this school thinkin' about killing himself, and it's not funny! [kids in the hallway stop to listen] You'd better take him serious, or he might actually do it. [all of a sudden jumps into view dressed in blue jeans and a hoodie and starts singing]

I've been feelin' sad, I've been bein' sad,
Can't talk to my mom, don't even have a dad.
I can't go on. What is livin' for?
My heart screams ""I DON'T WANNA LIVE NO MORE!""
[joined by a chorus of kids that are prerecorded on a boombox]
Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
I don't wanna live no more, no more, no more, no more.
[walks up to a boy and uses him as a ventriloquist puppet]
But Eric, we don't want you to die.
You're so kewl, we'd be sad at school.
[walks away and goes back to his normal voice]
Yeah, but you guys, you don't understand.
With my girlfriend, it's like I'm livin' in quicksand
Conflicting thoughts, I need a battered wife shelter.
My girlfriend is messed up, but all I wanna do is help her.
I'm suffocatin', I'm drowning in sorrow.
Gonna kill myself, probably around 2:30 tomorrow.
[with chorus]
But Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
[solo] Everybody!
[chorus a Capella] Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
But it's so hard!
Eric, we don't want you to die


Only you guys can make a difference. I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, or trans, I am going to kill myself unless you all start taking it seriously!


Eric, please don't die


[no one says a word. Cartman walks up to the Distracted Driving group] Distracted driving my asshole. [drops the mic and walks away with a mischievous smile]"
84,21,2,Richard Tweak,Hey Tweek.
85,21,2,Tweek Tweak,AAH! [drops the spinner]
86,21,2,Richard Tweak,How's it going with the fidget spinner?
87,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"Greeaat. [picks up the spinner and spins it again, only to see it fly off his hand a second later.]"
88,21,2,Richard Tweak,You seem a lot less anxious. Things are finally turning around for my little homosexual son. [a loud rocket sound is heard overhead.]
89,21,2,Tweek Tweak,What is that??
90,21,2,Richard Tweak,I'm not sure.
91,21,2,Tweek Tweak,[runs outside to look around.] D'aaah! [finally locates the origin of the sound and looks up to see a North Korean missile flying over the town] D'aaah! [runs back into the house and turns on the TV]
92,21,2,Anchor 4,No agreement has been reached between the parties involved. [Breaking News logo pops up] Breaking news now out of Colorado where the North Koreans appeared to have fired a missile over Tweek's house. [a small picture of him appears on the right side of the screen]
93,21,2,Tweek Tweak,D'aahaahaah!
94,21,2,Anchor 4,"Tweek, of course, the young boy who got the attention of Kim Jong-un last week. The news media in North Korea is calling the missile test a victory for its people. [what follows is actual footage of a Korean woman giving a speech]"
95,21,2,Translator,"Today, the great country of North Korea has proven its determination and fortitude by successfully firing a missile over Tweek's house. Perhaps now Tweek will come fight- [trails off]"
96,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Oh my God! Oh my God! Why is this happening to me?! They have to know that this isn't my fault!
97,21,2,Anchor 4,"In response to the North Korean test, the President of the United States has just tweeted this statement: ""You really think Tweek is scared? Tweek will single handedly go to North Korea and fuck ALL you slanty-eyed bitches doggy style."""
98,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Whaaat?! Why would he say that?!
99,21,2,Anchor 4,"The President also tweeted, ""...if you even think Tweek is worried about a bunch of dipshit, poor-ass, third world rice pickers...think again!"""
100,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Oh my God! What is he doing?!
101,21,2,Richard Tweak,"[rushes up to him with the fidget spinner and a cup of coffee] Tweek, Tweek, calm down. [puts his coffee on the sofa and tries to give the spinner to Tweek]"
102,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Why won't he just stop? Why?!
103,21,2,Richard Tweak,"Tweek, Tweek. [takes the remote control from Tweek's hand and lets it fall to the floor] Here, here's your fidget spinner."
104,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Why does he keep making it worse?!
105,21,2,Richard Tweak,"Fidget spinner, Tweek! Come on, son! [Tweek lets out a couple of grunts, and Richard responds with a soothing voice] Focus on the fidget spinner."
106,21,2,Driver 1,"Aww, Jeez, looks like North Korea launched another missile."
107,21,2,Wife,"Oh, really? Like another test? Where are you looking?"
108,21,2,Driver 1,I'm on Drudge. You see what the President tweeted about it?
109,21,2,Wife,"No, what'd he say?"
110,21,2,Driver 1,"President tweeted, ""North Korea is the butt hole of Asia and-"""
111,21,2,Wife,[sees Gary crossing the street] Innocent child!!
112,21,2,Driver 1,Baaaah! [Gary looks right as the car speeds towards him holds up his arms. The car slams into him.]
