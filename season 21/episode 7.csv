0,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[expectantly] Yes, Eric?"
1,21,7,Eric Cartman,[sobbing uncontrollably] Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!-
2,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Eric, this isn't working."
3,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please!"
4,21,7,Heidi Turner,You called me a whore and pushed me in front of a car.
5,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra-"
6,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Eric, you just can't keep being mean to me and blaming it on your blood sugar."
7,21,7,Eric Cartman,"But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom!"
8,21,7,Liane Cartman,"Yes, hon?"
9,21,7,Eric Cartman,"You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here!"
10,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Eric, if blood sugar is really the problem, then you need to change how you ear, right?"
11,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?"
12,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Eric, every time I've talked to you about maybe being a vegan with me, you just tell me vegans are pussies. But then you try and blame food and your mom for being-"
13,21,7,Eric Cartman,"It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please!"
14,21,7,Heidi Turner,You really mean it?
15,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on."
16,21,7,Heidi Turner,"All right, Eric. We'll see how this goes, okay? See you tomorrow."
17,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Okay, bye, honey. [hangs up]"
18,21,7,Eric Cartman,"That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude!"
19,21,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Pissed off at your girlfriend again, huh Eric?"
20,21,7,Eric Cartman,"She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore!"
21,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"That's enough, Cartman! I am so sick of hearing you call Heidi horrible things!"
22,21,7,Eric Cartman,That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship!
23,21,7,Heidi Turner,[approaching] Hey babe.
24,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh hey babe, what's going on?"
25,21,7,Heidi Turner,What are you up to?
26,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[uninterested] Nothin', just tellin' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan."
27,21,7,Heidi Turner,[happy] That's great. You wanna come eat with me? I can explain what I packed.
28,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome. [he leaves with her]"
29,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't get it. I just really don't get it. How is she still supporting him?!
30,21,7,Stan Marsh,"She loves him, I guess."
31,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,But he clearly sucks! She has to know he sucks. What the hell is going on?!
32,21,7,Butters Stotch,"Well, it's not our problem."
33,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,It is our problem. This is affecting us! Our whole school. There's got to be a reason she sticks by him.
34,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[spots her and runs up] Oh Heidi? Heidi, you got a sec?"
35,21,7,Heidi Turner,Oh. Hey Kyle.
36,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. Uh, listen, uh... I-I know you and Cartman have an anniversary coming up and, I was just wondering, you know, um. How do you think he's doing? Aaas a boyfriend."
37,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Well, whattaya mean?"
38,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, you know, like, some of us are thinking that, uh, maybe he's not super-qualified to be with you?"
39,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Oh, God, not you too."
40,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Just, like, what are the things about Cartman that you find remotely redeeming?"
41,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Look, don't you think I get it enough from my girlfriends? ""He sucks, Heidi. What's wrong with you? Why can't you admit he's a loser? How could anyone ever go with him?"" I was just following my heart. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?"
42,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,You don't have to get defensive. I just-
43,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[gets in his face] Who's being defensive?! He's great! We're doing great! I didn't make a bad decision! I don't need you to stand there and say ""I told you so!"" [turns around and walks off]"
44,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't say ""I... [she whips around again] told you-"""
45,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[points at him] You know, you don't know what Eric's like when we're alone, okay? He's actually really good to me. [turns around and walks away]"
46,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,Wooow.
47,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Heidi! [walks in with a bag of food] Oh my God, you're not gonna believe this."
48,21,7,Heidi Turner,What?
49,21,7,Eric Cartman,You were so right [Heidi closes the door] when you said there were vegan options for everything. [puts the food on the table] Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat?
50,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, the vegan meat that's made with all vegetables and plants."
51,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat."
52,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Really? That's great, babe."
53,21,7,Eric Cartman,So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC.
54,21,7,Heidi Turner,Oh wow.
55,21,7,Eric Cartman,"It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it."
56,21,7,Heidi Turner,[Heidi tries a breaded breast] It tasted just like KFC.
57,21,7,Eric Cartman,"I know, right?! Isn't that crazy?! [Cartman eats another breaded breast] Like, like seriously, how can you even tell that this was vegan? Try the, try the Beyond Mashed Potatoes and Gravy too. [hands her the mashed potatoes and gravy] They say you can even drink the Beyond Gravy by itself as like a protein boost. [eats some more of his breast while she eats the mashed potatoes and gravy] I don't know about you, but I could eat this every day."
58,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, it's really good."
59,21,7,Eric Cartman,[evilly narrowing his eyes to slits] Delicious.
60,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, listen: I think I know why Heidi won't admit Cartman's a horrible boyfriend."
61,21,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, are you still on this?"
62,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! It's important.
63,21,7,Butters Stotch,"Maybe she's telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don't see."
64,21,7,Eric Cartman,[running up to them] You guys! You guys! Have you seen Heidi? [walks on past them]
65,21,7,Stan Marsh,No.
66,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Well uh, we've been trying some different foods lately and uh, [turns around] Heidi's put on some pounds, you guys."
67,21,7,Token Black,Heidi's getting fat?
68,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Token. Don't start rippin' on me for havin' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it. [smiles]"
69,21,7,Heidi Turner,[walks up behind him] Hey babe.
70,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What's goin' on? [a surprised look flashes on his face]"
71,21,7,Heidi Turner,"I-ah, I'm not feeling the best again. [Cartman smiles again] I might see if my mom can come pick me up."
72,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Pick you up? That could be tough. [a shot at the boys, who just look blankly at him and Heidi. Kyle, though, is not amused]"
73,21,7,Heidi Turner,"I, I know, but I just feel bloated. I think there might have been something bad in that Beyond Arby's."
74,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse's office. [the surprised look flashes on his face again, then disappears]"
75,21,7,Heidi Turner,Can you come with?
76,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh sure. [they turn around and walk away, but Cartman looks over his shoulder and points at Heidi's bloated figure]"
77,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,We have to help that girl. Can't you see what's happening?
78,21,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it's none of our business."
79,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,You're wrong. In a way... I think we're all going out with Cartman right now.
80,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Uh huh. Yeah, I understand that, faggot. And you should understand how my balls are gonna taste when your country starts needing money. I don't give two shits about a treaty. You're a Polish midget. [A knock is heard at the doors] Come in. [three advisers come in - Mike Pence, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell - and Garrison gets back on the phone] Uh huh. Hang, uh hang on. I'm gonna call you back. Yeah, go fuck yourself, retard. [hangs up]"
81,21,7,Mitch McConnell,"Mr. President, we have a problem. People are pretty upset."
82,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Hoh, don't tell me people are still made about that nigger thing."
83,21,7,Mike Pence,"It's pronounced Niger, Mr. President. And it's a country in Africa."
84,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, aren't we fancy. Okay, I don't want a bunch of [finger quotes] Nigers in Africa aiding terrorists."
85,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Mr. President, you need to be a little more careful. There's an investigation. A worker with ties to Russia was found raped and executed."
86,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Raped and executed? Oh, you mean fucked to death? Oh yeah, that was me."
87,21,7,Mitch McConnell,"Mr. President, people are starting to question your oath to the office."
88,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"My oath to the office was that I would fuck everyone to death, remember?"
89,21,7,Memberberries,"Ooo, I 'member. Me too, I 'member. I 'member that."
90,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"[to the berries] You guys be quiet, [to his advisers] and you guys just get out there and put a positive spin on this whole thing."
91,21,7,Mitch McConnell,How are we supposed to put a positive spin on it?
92,21,7,Paul Ryan,It's getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it's time we put our foot down.
93,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Oooo. [whips out a remote control and presses a button on it, making the doors close and lock automatically. The advisers turn to see this] Hope you brought some condoms."
94,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello. I know things have been difficult between us lately. I know you think all boys are sort of pigs, but just know that a lot of us boys think girls are amazing and smart and beautiful. [dead air] Not, not like hot-beautiful, I mean like inside-beautiful. I, I'm not saying you're hot. You're not, you're not hot. I'm not saying you're ugly. It doesn't matter- you're all hot on the inside. If we could all just see inside you, it would be hot. [realizes he's out on a limb] Oh, shit."
95,21,7,Wendy Testaburger,"What do you want, Kyle?"
96,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,It's Heidi Turner. You guys shouldn't criticize her so much for going with Cartman.
97,21,7,Annie Knitts,Why not? Eric Cartman's a horrible person.
98,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I know! I, I know that, okay? Trust me, I hate Cartman as much as any of you, but just, give her some space, you know? You can't keep on saying ""We told you so"", because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasn't dumb."
99,21,7,Nichole Daniels,Why do you care? Do you like Heidi?
100,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,No!
101,21,7,Molly,"Oh my God, he so likes Heidi."
102,21,7,Lola,Obvi.
103,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,No I don't! ... Do I?
104,21,7,Butters Stotch,"[walks up to him] Hey, Kyle. Hey, I was thinkin' about what you said. How we should all help Heidi break up with Eric? You're right, it's our moral obligation."
105,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, no, we're not getting involved with that."
106,21,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh, we're not?"
107,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[stands up]Yeah, no, yeah, I uh dya, I think we need to stay out of it. [walks away]"
108,21,7,Butters Oh Okay then,Dialog
109,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, can we talk?"
110,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Sure, Kyle. What's up? [brings out a harness and puts it on]"
111,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I just, I hope that maybe you can realize what you have with Heidi and, and just try to be good to her, okay?"
112,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There's always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it's all part of trying to make each other better. [picks up a big bass drum and straps it onto the harness, then picks up some drumsticks] Someday, maybe you'll have a girlfriend and you'll understand. Oh, here she comes. [at the far end of the hallway, Heidi rounds the corner and walks towards them, and Cartman starts beating the drum] BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi's comin' through."
113,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[walks up to Cartman] Wha, what are you doing, Eric?"
114,21,7,Eric Cartman,I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite.
115,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Oh, okay. Um, are we still on for lunch?"
116,21,7,Eric Cartman,"You betcha, can't wait."
117,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Okay, see ya. [walks away, vaguely upset]"
118,21,7,Eric Cartman,[resumes the drum beat] BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!
119,21,7,Anchor Bill Keegan,"Some concern over the President's competency again today. It was during a Middle East peace conference when the President referred to the people of Saudi Arabia as a bunch of ""dirty sand Nigers"". Though the comments seem divisive, Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, says he's sticking by his President 100%. [next shot is of Paul Ryan with a black eye stained with semen]"
120,21,7,Reporter,"Speaker Ryan, it's the anniversary of the President being elected. How do you think he's doing?"
121,21,7,Paul Ryan,Well whattaya mean? He's great. We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don't get to see all his good qualities.
122,21,7,Reporter,Uh huh. And is that semen on your black eye?
123,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that's just, that's doorknob cum."
124,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You doin' okay, Heidi?"
125,21,7,Heidi Turner,I keep thinking Eric's going to change.
126,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[sits down next to her and sighs] Heidi, people like Cartman, they always make things someone else's fault. We all wrongly see ourselves as the victims sometimes, but Cartman sees himself as the victim all the time. He'll always find someone to blame for his shortcomings, and because of that, he's never gonna change."
127,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Before we started going out I was in a really bad place. I felt... pushed away by society. Then this guy came along who told me all the things I wanted to hear, and I just went with it. Does that make me a bad person? [Rihanna's ""Unfaithful"" begins to play]"
128,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Heidi. Good people make bad decisions every day."
129,21,7,Heidi Turner,"I've been defending him for so long. I don't know how I'm gonna face people if I finally give up. [next scene is Heidi looking through her scrapbook at the memories she and Cartman created together. His discomfort begins to show in the fourth picture. She closes the book, and her location is shown - she's in bed. Next scene shows her at her locker putting books away when she notices someone looking at her. It's Kyle, looking at her from his locker. He then puts his books into his locker. Next scene shows Heidi and Cartman at the park bench, where she leaves him and he grabs onto her leg to delay her departure. Next scene has Kyle receiving a letter from Heidi. He reads it and smiles. Next scene has Garrison and Xi Jinping holding a news conference, and three bar patrons back at home turning away and crying. Next scene shows the Turners having dinner at a restaurant, in a booth by the window]"
130,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[sobbing outside the window] Please Heidi! [he pounds on the window a few times before finally sliding down to the ground] Please! [her parents are stunned. Next scene shows Kyle and Heidi on the school swings, chatting away]"
131,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei- [Token slams the door on him. Seconds later the doorbell rings. Token goes back to answer it] Hei-, Hei-, Hei-"
132,21,7,Token Black,[not happy] What do you want?
133,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Token."
134,21,7,Token Black,So?
135,21,7,Eric Cartman,"I have nothing now, Token. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please?"
136,21,7,Token Black,What?! Why?! You still have a house!
137,21,7,Eric Cartman,"I know how you feel now, Token. To be pissed off at the world. To feel completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff. [Again, Token slams the door on him. Again the doorbell rings, and again Token goes to answer it] Token, pleeease! I'm sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys feel! Please, what time is your family gonna go disrespect the flag and stuff? I wanna go with!"
138,21,7,Token Black,Get outta here!
139,21,7,Linda Black,[appears behind Token] What's going on?
140,21,7,Token Black,"[upset with Cartman] Nothing, Mom."
141,21,7,Eric Cartman,Heidi broke up with meeeeee.
142,21,7,Linda Black,"Token, he's freezing. [to Cartman] Come on in out of the snow."
143,21,7,Eric Cartman,[entering] Thank youuuu.
144,21,7,Token Black,...NO!!
145,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Okay, we're safe to talk."
146,21,7,Mike Pence,"It's not safe! Nowhere is safe, don't you understand?! We're all about to get killed!"
147,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Sshh, keep your voices down! Look at this!"
148,21,7,Mike Pence,What are all these numbers?
149,21,7,Paul Ryan,"The latest approval ratings. I've been researching our own independent poll. The President is tanking. These numbers are so low that we just might have an out. Well, don't you guys see what this means?"
150,21,7,Mitch McConnell,"I don't know anything, I'm just a turtle."
151,21,7,Paul Ryan,It means that the swing voters are turning against him. It's those people that matter. Those are the ones who can finally turn this thing around!
152,21,7,Mitch McConnell,And then we don't have to get killed! We can't let the President know about this. just let him- [the door opens]
153,21,7,Herbert Garrison,[walks in] What are you guys talkin' about?
154,21,7,Mike Pence,"No, nothing, Mr. President."
155,21,7,Paul Ryan,Nothing!
156,21,7,Mitch McConnell,"No, nope!"
157,21,7,Herbert Garrison,Just having' a little chat or somethin'?
158,21,7,Mike Pence,"[looks at the folder Pence is holding, takes it, and walks over to the President] It's an opinion poll, Mr. President. Your numbers are down and I wanted to show you so you could do something."
159,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Oh, you bitch! [to the President] I was the one who researched the poll, Mr. President!"
160,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Let me see that. [takes the folder and leafs through it] Huh. Isn't that interesting? But it's not a problem. See, I know something about societal psychology that you three turd balls don't. Everything's gonna be fine."
161,21,7,Eric Cartman,So... You guys about done with the soup?
162,21,7,Linda Black,"Don't you like it, Eric?"
163,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff?"
164,21,7,Steve Black,What?
165,21,7,Eric Cartman,Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it?
166,21,7,Steve Black,What the hell are you talking about?!
167,21,7,Token Black,I told you not to let him in.
168,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt!"
169,21,7,Linda Black,"I'm sorry your girlfriend broke up with you, Eric, but... maybe you'll get back together."
170,21,7,Eric Cartman,"No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls."
171,21,7,Steve Black,Heidi? Turner? The Turners' daughter?
172,21,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah...
173,21,7,Steve Black,I thought she was with that Kyle Broflovski kid.
174,21,7,Eric Cartman,[sadness switches to anger in a flash] What?
175,21,7,Steve Black,I saw them at the park today holding hands.
176,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[dramatic music begins] Kyle? Kyle?! Kyle!! [a montage begins with five marching happy Kyles appearing] Kyle! Kyle! Kyle Kyle Kyle! [a big red heart appears and breaks, and a line of smiling Kyles marches out of it in shades of pink. Next scene is a Jewish dance performed by hasidim. Next scene is Cartman out on the street striking a match...] Kyle! [...and burning a giant flag on the ground with it.] Kyle! [the flames spread to fill up the screen. The next scene shows a cackling Kyle coming up out of the water like a giant sea monster as Eric and Heidi hold on to each other. Kyle holds a menorah reminiscent of a trident. Next scene is another group of hasidim dancing] Kyle! [next scene is Cartman and Heidi running away, only to be stopped by Kyle popping up before them like an exploding volcano, cackling. Cartman and Heidi turn and run away again, but the ground around them is compromised and Kyle's shadow covers them both as they look up at him. Next scene is back at the dining room at Token's mansion] Kyle..."
177,21,7,Steve Black,"Yeah, Kyle."
178,21,7,Eric Cartman,KYLE! [the other kids in the hallway clear the way as Cartman appears at the end of the hallway behind Kyle. Dramatic Western showdown music plays] I should have known. You lying snake!
179,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around] Cartman, I didn't mean for things to happen the way they did."
180,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?!"
181,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you weren't happy."
182,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle!"
183,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,All you did was bitch about her all the time.
184,21,7,Eric Cartman,"You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you and me!"
185,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Cartman. I-"
186,21,7,Eric Cartman,[slams Kyle into the lockers] You took everything from me!
187,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,Stop it!
188,21,7,Eric Cartman,All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!
189,21,7,Butters Stotch,"Fuck him up, Eric!"
190,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[goes in for the attack] Aaah! [Kyle delivers a punch] Ugh! [Cartman goes down straight away] Fuck you, Kyle!"
191,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Cartman. You just have to accept that Heidi's moved on."
192,21,7,Molly,"Guys, I just wanna say, here's to Heidi. Welcome back to the land of the living."
193,21,7,The other girls,Yay Heidi!
194,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[giggles] Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking me out. This is really fun."
195,21,7,Red,No worries. We're just glad you finally came to your senses.
196,21,7,Annie Knitts,"Yeah, no kidding. We seriously thought you might marry that piece of shit! [the girls laugh]"
197,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[a bit sheepish] Well, you know, he- he actually had some good qualities too."
198,21,7,Red,"Uhh, yeah, like what? Racism?"
199,21,7,Bebe Stevens,Or the sociopath part?
200,21,7,Courtney,"Yeah. I mean, no offense, Heidi, but what the fuck were you thinking?"
201,21,7,Lola,"Guys, she admitted she made a mistake."
202,21,7,Molly,You make a mistake on your homework. What Heidi did was more like a momentary loss of all sanity. [the girls laugh]
203,21,7,Heidi Turner,[feeling pushed away again] It was just what I believed in.
204,21,7,Bebe Stevens,"Don't worry, Heidi. We're not gonna keep telling you we told you so."
205,21,7,Lola,But we told you so. [the girls laugh]
206,21,7,Bebe Stevens,The only thing I wanna know is... how did you bring yourself to actually KISS him?
207,21,7,The girls,Eewwww!
208,21,7,Red,Can you imagine? Eric Cartman's breath on your mouth?
209,21,7,The girls,"Ew, ugh! [this is depressing Heidi as sad music begins to play]"
210,21,7,Courtney,"[imitating Cartman] Heidi, come here. I want to kiss you with my tongue!"
211,21,7,The girls,"Ew, ugh! [they laugh as Heidi wilts]"
212,21,7,Heidi Turner,Hi Eric.
213,21,7,Eric Cartman,What are you doing here?
214,21,7,Heidi Turner,I don't know. I think I- I just wanna make sure... you're doing okay. I want you to know I'll always care about you.
215,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[sniffles] That's good to know, 'cause like, nothing helps more when you're down than knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care."
216,21,7,Heidi Turner,[sits next to him] I'm sorry that I've hurt you. I think maybe I am just stupid and I don't know what I want and it ends up hurting people.
217,21,7,Eric Cartman,"No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault."
218,21,7,Heidi Turner,But I'm the one who-
219,21,7,Eric Cartman,"No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did."
220,21,7,Heidi Turner,Hey.
221,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! You all set to go?
222,21,7,Heidi Turner,[walks in] I wanted to talk to you first.
223,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, sure."
224,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Kyle, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and it was all making me really confused."
225,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that's understandable."
226,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[turns and holds his hands] I was being manipulated, and I didn't even see it. I never do. And, I don't think you saw it either, Kyle."
227,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean?
228,21,7,Heidi Turner,"I've come to realize that it's not my fault. It's your fault, Kyle. You made all this happen. Made me question who I was."
229,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"But Heidi, I thought-"
230,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[puts her index finger on his lips] Shh. [walks away] But it's okay. You can't help it. It's how you were raised, what you were taught. My heritage is Irish, so I'm prone to being moody. And your heritage... well, you know... you can be a little sneaky sometimes and not even realize it. [turns left to walk out the door] I'm sorry, Kyle, but everybody's trying to live life the best they can. It's hard enough without your people always trying to get ahead. [walks out and closes the door]"
231,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude... did she just call me a dirty Jew? [he walks to the window to see her walk away, and sees Cartman waiting for her. Cartman sees him at the window. Heidi meets Cartman and they walk away together, with Cartman looking over his shoulder at Kyle with a smug look on his face]"
