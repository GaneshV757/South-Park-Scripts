0,11,8,Eric Cartman,[picks out a figure] Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip. [moves the package around with his left hand and strokes his chin with his right] That's pretty kewl. Let's see...
1,11,8,Teen Boy,Cock! [Cartman is startled.]
2,11,8,Eric Cartman,[puts the Slammer back on the rack and selects another figure.] The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
3,11,8,Teen Boy,"Asshole! Cock! Asshole, shit, shit cock! [his neck and face get taut as he blurts this out]"
4,11,8,Clerk,"[nearby] Ma'am, is that your son over there?"
5,11,8,Mom,"Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome."
6,11,8,Clerk,Tourette's Syndrome?
7,11,8,Mom,It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.
8,11,8,Clerk,Oh...
9,11,8,Teen Boy,"[turns his head hard to the left, his eyes shut] Shiit! [turns his head back to face forward] Dumb shiiit!"
10,11,8,Mom,"[goes to take her son home] A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go?"
11,11,8,Thomas and his mom,All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!
12,11,8,Mom,"Here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home. [selects a figure and hands it to Thomas, who walks away with her, smiling. Cartman watches as they leave]"
13,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and walks off, saying softly] Dude, that mom is kewl. [he arrives at the checkout line with his action figure]"
14,11,8,Thomas and his mom,[stands in line behind Cartman] Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!
15,11,8,Eric Cartman,[turns around and glares at Thomas] Are you talkin' to me?!
16,11,8,Thomas and his mom,No. Cocknose!
17,11,8,Eric Cartman,"What's your problem, kid?!"
18,11,8,Mom,"Oh, a-I'm sorry. [Thomas backs away a bit] My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome. [a crowd begins to gather around them]"
19,11,8,Eric Cartman,What?
20,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!"
21,11,8,Mom,People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.
22,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Asshole ASSHOLE.
23,11,8,Eric Cartman,[waves his arms around] Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
24,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Mom, can we just go home, please?"
25,11,8,Mom,"It's okay, Thomas. They understand."
26,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"I want tuh go! [throws down his action figure and walks off, his hands over his mouth] Shitfag!"
27,11,8,Man 1,Poor kid.
28,11,8,Clerk,Yeah.
29,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and faces the crowd] All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?"
30,11,8,Clerk,It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
31,11,8,Man 1,"Yeah! [Cartman blinks - CHING! He begins to think: ""I've got a golden ticket... I've got a golden""]"
32,11,8,Eric Cartman,Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance] haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. [throws his action figure into the air and runs out the door]
33,11,8,Clerk,Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
34,11,8,Eric Cartman,I don't need the toy! I've found something better! [dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
35,11,8,Liane Cartman,"It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse."
36,11,8,Eric Cartman,Puh- pussy!
37,11,8,Liane Cartman,Oh...
38,11,8,Eric Cartman,Pussy! Cock! Shit! [covers his mouth in faking embarrassment]
39,11,8,Liane Cartman,"Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called ""Tour, Tourette's Syndrome""?"
40,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! [covers his mouth immediately]"
41,11,8,Doctor,That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
42,11,8,Eric Cartman,...Cocksucker!
43,11,8,Doctor,"[begins to think and walks off a bit] ...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse."
44,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!"
45,11,8,Liane Cartman,"Oh Doctor, can you help him?"
46,11,8,Doctor,[turns around and walks back to them] We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can.
47,11,8,Eric Cartman,"But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say."
48,11,8,Doctor,"Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve."
49,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look]"
50,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Shit! Butthole! [walks up to Wendy] Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry. [smiles and moves on] Titties! Cock! [he's relishing this. He points to a redhead] Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!"
51,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. [she walks up to them]"
52,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!"
53,11,8,Principal Victoria,"Good morning, Eric. [turns right and walks away. Cartman walks off in the opposite direction]"
54,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal?"
55,11,8,Butters Stotch,"Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'."
56,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
57,11,8,Craig Tucker,"[in admiration] He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say ""shitballs"" to the principal I'd be sooo happy."
58,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[deciding to explain things. Mr. Mackey is in the background] Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole! [the other kids lean away] Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it."
59,11,8,Principal Victoria,"It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave."
60,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[after some thought, points and says] He's faking."
61,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[his thunder is stolen and he covers for it] Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle? [walks to Kyle] Asscheeks! [hauls Kyle off to a clearing] Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition."
62,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!"
63,11,8,Eric Cartman,"...Oh, okay, you figured me out. [claps] Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble."
64,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,Who cares about saying whatever you-?
65,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle."
66,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Grrhh, whatever. [walks off in a huff. Mr. Mackey walks by]"
67,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! [Mr. Mackey does nothing but walk away]"
68,11,8,Craig Tucker,"If I could say ""asspussy"" to the counselor I would be sooo happy."
69,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?"
70,11,8,Eric Cartman,Dicktits!
71,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"[glances back at Cartman, then finishes writing] -when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?"
72,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Shit! Asshole! [Mrs. Garrison looks at Cartman with a bit of shock, then turns to the board.] 'Scuse me. [Cartman smiles]"
73,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-"
74,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch! [the class laughs. Cartman pretends to be hurt] You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness."
75,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"[facing the class] All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay? [turns to the board] Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers"
76,11,8,Eric Cartman,Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
77,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,Will you knock it off already?!
78,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE."
79,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't push me, asshole!"
80,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"Kyle, watch your language! [Cartman lets out a hearty laugh]"
81,11,8,Craig Tucker,"[getting miserable] If I could yell ""tampon dickshit"" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy."
82,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore."
83,11,8,Principal Victoria,"I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. [Mr. Donaldson walks into view]"
84,11,8,Mr Donaldson,Hello Mrs. Garrison- [turns his head to the left] Ass. ASS. [recovers] I want to help your class better understand this illness. [turns his head to the left] Piss!
85,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks into the office, with Cartman following] No! Up yours, fatboy!"
86,11,8,Eric Cartman,Kyle please! I'm sorry!
87,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!"
88,11,8,Mr Donaldson,Faking? [Kyle is sure he's got Cartman on the hook] You think people with Tourette's are faking?!
89,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[his certainty gone] N-no, I'm just saying that I think-"
90,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say? [turns his head to the left] Ass! ASS! [recovers] We aren't ""faking"", young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass. [turns his head to the left] PISS! PIIISS!"
91,11,8,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Kyle. [turns his head to the left, where Kyle happens to be] Crap-filled vagina!"
92,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!"
93,11,8,Principal Victoria,No.
94,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this ""bully"" to see that Tourette's is very real. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss."
95,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor. [turns his head to the right, where Kyle happens to be. Kyle jumps in his chair] ASS! [recovers and clears his throat] I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's"
96,11,8,Teen Boy,Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze. [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrr! [recovers] It isn't contagious like some people think. [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrrrrrr!
97,11,8,Blonde Girl,"A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic [leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers] is that I have to bend my neck and snap her fingers. But a lot of people don't even notice it. [leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]"
98,11,8,Thomas and his mom,[turns his head to the right] Aw shit! COCK!
99,11,8,Brunette,"Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I [blinks and bobs her head] Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself."
100,11,8,Mr Donaldson,You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
101,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun."
102,11,8,Teen Boy,"Fun? [shakes her head quickly] Brrrrr! [recovers] This really isn't all that fun. [shakes her head quickly] Brrr, brrrrrr!"
103,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Aw shit!
104,11,8,Brunette,"[blinks and bobs her head] Boop. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]"
105,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"[turns his head to the left] Piiiss, coming from my aaass!"
106,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents [turns his head to the right] Aw shit! [recovers] My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead."
107,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,Dude...
108,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so."
109,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, come on!"
110,11,8,Mr Donaldson,So then you apologize for what you said before?
111,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]"
112,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities. [turns his head to the left] Piss! PISS!"
113,11,8,Sheila Broflovski,Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
114,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate. [Cartman walks into view and bats his eyes at Kyle sweetly. Kyle does not appreciate this]"
115,11,8,Gerald Broflovski,Well Kyle?
116,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
117,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle."
118,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[grudgingly, louder] I'm sorry."
119,11,8,Eric Cartman,"You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?"
120,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- [stops himself]"
121,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother. [looks at Gerald and Sheila] Fat Jew! Jew bitch!"
122,11,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, thank you Eric."
123,11,8,Eric Cartman,Thank you. Big-nosed kike! [Sheila laughs nervously]
124,11,8,Mr Donaldson,Well I think we can all put this behind us now. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss out my aaass!
125,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face! [thumps his chest and clears his throat] Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one. [starts to walk away] Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works. [stops to whisper to Thomas] Isn't having Tourette's awesome? [leaves]"
126,11,8,Announcer,Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report.
127,11,8,Chris Hansen,"I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from To Catch A Predator, where we bust men looking for sex with children."
128,11,8,Chris Hansen,Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.
129,11,8,Predator,"Oh God, Whoa no."
130,11,8,Chris Hansen,What are you doin' here?
131,11,8,Predator,"I'm just' bein' stupid, I guess."
132,11,8,Chris Hansen,But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
133,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[doing a voice-over]
Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman


[he doesn't say his name]"
134,11,8,Chris Hansen,"This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado."
135,11,8,Announcer,Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC.
136,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[adding to the commercial] Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true. [jumps at the camera] Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! [jumps back in shock, covers his mouth, then smiles at the camera sweetly, bending his head to the right]"
137,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!"
138,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
139,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[serves himself some liquid] Yes. It's all finally come to fruition. [gently swirls the ice around] The final cog in my... master plan. [turns around to face Kyle] This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air. [turns back and prepares a drink for Kyle] Despicable things. And people will call me brave."
140,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!"
141,11,8,Eric Cartman,[takes the drink to Kyle] Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
142,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,...Scotch?
143,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[quickly gives him the drink in triumph] Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy."
144,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!"
145,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Then the game is on, Kyle."
146,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! [Cartman looks at his drink]"
147,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[walks back to make another ""Scotch""] Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" [realizes what just happened]"
148,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,What did you say?
149,11,8,Eric Cartman,Uhh nuh-nothing...
150,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! [runs out of the room and slams the door]
151,11,8,Eric Cartman,Hm. That was... weird.
152,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss out my aaass! [applause rises from the crowd]"
153,11,8,Thomas and his mom,The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no... [turns his head to the right] Cock!
154,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[Mr. Donaldson adjusts the mic to his height] Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls! [applause rises from the crowd] You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. [applause rises from the crowd]"
155,11,8,Craig Tucker,"If I could say ""titty sprinkles"" on national television I would be sooo happy."
156,11,8,Eric Cartman,"And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up! [startled by his own words, then covers his mouth as the crowd falls silent.] Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad. [turns away from the mic and mumbles] What the hell is going on?"
157,11,8,Mr Mackey,"Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?"
158,11,8,Eric Cartman,"No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh, [helplessly] I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! [covers his mouth]"
159,11,8,Patty Nelson,Eewwww!
160,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[clambors offstage] Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! [runs through the crowd]"
161,11,8,Butters Stotch,[does a double take and smiles] Uh hey Eric!
162,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[finishes up and looks at Butters] Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?"
163,11,8,Butters Stotch,Wuh who are you talking about?
164,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners. [he covers his mouth in horror as Butters is stunned] Wah! [faces Butters]"
165,11,8,Butters Stotch,You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
166,11,8,Eric Cartman,I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! [runs out of the restroom]
167,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!"
168,11,8,Liane Cartman,"Is there a problem, sweetie?"
169,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and faces her] No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's [struggles to keep control] AAAA no, NAAAA! [he's got the crowd's attention] I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year. [now composed] Ah, I need to be going now."
170,11,8,Mr Mackey,Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
171,11,8,Eric Cartman,[apprehensive] Dateline. Right. [backs away but can't control his statements] I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! [runs out the door with his hands firmly over his mouth]
172,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen."
173,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[rushes onto the set] Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show."
174,11,8,Chris Hansen,Why not?
175,11,8,Eric Cartman,"My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine."
176,11,8,Chris Hansen,[rolls up his notes and motions Cartman to a stool] Why don't you have a seat?
177,11,8,Eric Cartman,No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
178,11,8,Chris Hansen,Go ahead and take a seat.
179,11,8,Eric Cartman,[heads for the door] But I'm not gonna do the-
180,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Take a seat, right over there. [Cartman backs up and sits on the stool, then puts his cap on the bar] What are you doing here?"
181,11,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?"
182,11,8,Chris Hansen,But you are doing the show.
183,11,8,Eric Cartman,"You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say."
184,11,8,Chris Hansen,Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.
185,11,8,Eric Cartman,"No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad. [gets his cap and puts it on] So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. [hops off the stool and walks away]"
186,11,8,Chris Hansen,Why don't you take a seat?
187,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!"
188,11,8,Chris Hansen,Have a seat.
189,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[begins backing up] No, I'm just gonna go- [wonders how this is happening]"
190,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Take a seat, right over there."
191,11,8,Eric Cartman,[gets back on the stool and whispers to himself] How does he do that?
192,11,8,Chris Hansen,"You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called ""To Catch A Predator"". We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline. Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself. [Cartman is scared] It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you ""shot yourself"". [Cartman is more scared, and a series of expressions cross his face]"
193,11,8,Announcer,"Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado. This! ...is Dateline."
194,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm [stretches his name out so it sounds like nails on a chalkboard] Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction."
195,11,8,A Page,"Five minutes, kid."
196,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this? [walks to a nearby table and begins to pray] God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!"" [covers his mouth quickly] Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle."
197,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?"
198,11,8,Thomas and his mom,[using a walkie talkie] Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!
199,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,You sure you don't wanna back out?
200,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!"
201,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"". [a light brown car pulls in] The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. [the car stops and Thomas looks around]"
202,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"[walks up to Thomas] Hi, are you CuteBilly182?"
203,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!
204,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"[shaking with excitement] Oh God, I'm so turned on right now. This is your house? Your, your parents aren't home, are they?"
205,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!"
206,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,[dances by] Okay. Cock! Don't take too long. [laughs and prances into the studio]
207,11,8,Chris Hansen,"So now let's meet a child who haaas Tourette's Syndrooome, and who must fi- [the audience doors open and HotForBoys219 prances down the aisle laughing]"
208,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"Ho, whoa, wait a minute. This ain't no house."
209,11,8,Chris Hansen,[stands up angrily] What are you doing?!
210,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"[gasps and hides his face] Chris Hansen?! Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it!"
211,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Sir, why don't you take a seat, right over there."
212,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv! Whoa! [takes out a gun and shoots himself in the head. Nearby audience members move away, and the audience gets restless]"
213,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Aw, not again."
214,11,8,Eric Cartman,Kyle?
215,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Surprise, fatass!"
216,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, what are you doing?"
217,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly! [car horns blare outside, and Kyle goes to take a look. The parking lot quickly fills up as drivers park and leave their cars.] Whoa."
218,11,8,Pedo 2,"[walks up to Thomas and waves a Wendy's bag in front of him] Hey, I brought you some Wendy's."
219,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!"
220,11,8,Pedo 2,Score! [goes inside]
221,11,8,Pedo 2,"Oh no, it's Chris Hansen! [drops his meal and shoots himself]"
222,11,8,Audience Members,Whoa! Who is that? What's going on?
223,11,8,Chris Hansen,What the hell is going on?!
224,11,8,Pedo 3,"Wait a minute. Oh God, it's Chris Hansen! [shoots himself]"
225,11,8,Pedo 4,Chris Hansen! [shoots himself]
226,11,8,Pedo 5,Dateline?! [shoots himself]
227,11,8,Pedo 6,I knew it! [shoots himself]
228,11,8,Pedo 7,"There aren't really brownies! [shoots himself. More pedophiles enter and kill themselves, and the audience begins rushing out of the studio]"
229,11,8,Chris Hansen,Hey! Do you have something to do with this? Answer meee!
230,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Stupid shit! Cock! [more audience members rush by]
231,11,8,Chris Hansen,"What?! Nobody talks to me like that! Why don't you take a seat? Take a seat, right over there."
232,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!
233,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Fine, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you! [leaves, and there are no other adults left]"
234,11,8,Craig Tucker,"[walks up to Thomas] Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy."
235,11,8,Thomas and his mom,You would?
236,11,8,Craig Tucker,"Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?"
237,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[feeling triumphant] Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! [Cartman is silent for a moment, then hugs Kyle and sobs. Kyle wasn't expecting this]"
238,11,8,Eric Cartman,Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
239,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
240,11,8,Eric Cartman,"I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!"
241,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I- I beat you!"
242,11,8,Eric Cartman,"You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say! [heads up the aisle and out of the studio] I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! [Kyle is alone on set, but Thomas comes up and stands next to him]"
243,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Aww shit!
244,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,Aww shit!
