0,11,10,Eric Cartman,"All right, let's try over here. [points straight ahead. Jason appears behind them] Set up traps there, and there as well. [points right] Last time I saw him he ran right through here. [moves, revealing Stan further back. Cartman moves to his left, and Kyle is seen sitting on a fallen tree]"
1,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story."
2,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[sets up a trip wire between two stones] It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now. [drops the rope, walks forward, and whips out a walkie-talkie] Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?"
3,11,10,Clyde Donovan,"This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. [behind him are Jimmy, Jason, and Craig hoisting the net into place]"
4,11,10,Eric Cartman,"Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. [Tweek joins Stan in the background]"
5,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!"
6,11,10,Eric Cartman,"O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?! [whips out his walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?"
7,11,10,Token Black,[pissed off] ... I don't want the code name Blackie.
8,11,10,Eric Cartman,"Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! [puts away the walkie talkie and gets back to setting the trip wire.]"
9,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,This is fucking retarded!
10,11,10,Eric Cartman,"Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. [finishes setting the trip wire]"
11,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!"
12,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[whispers loudly] Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet? [whips out the walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!"
13,11,10,Butters Stotch,[stands on a lookout platform with a telescope next to him. He answers in a subdued manner] This is faggot. Go ahead.
14,11,10,Eric Cartman,Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
15,11,10,Butters Stotch,"Okay, will do. Faggot out. [turns right and looks through the telescope] Waagh."
16,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, that's enough. [hops off the tree and walks forward] Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!"
17,11,10,Eric Cartman,"It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!"
18,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!"
19,11,10,Butters Stotch,"Uh, I got somethin'! I got it! [the other boys turn and pay attention] It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!"
20,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[to Token] Set off diversion track C! [Token sets off a small bomb under a pile of leaves. Nearby a leprechaun skips into view, then stops upon seeing the boys]"
21,11,10,Stan Marsh,Dude...
22,11,10,Jimmy,"Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun."
23,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[charging forth] Get it! [the leprechaun runs away, and all the boys except Kyle, who is dumbfounded, give chase] Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! [the leprechaun crawls under a tree trunk and gets up. He trips over a rope and a net descends on him; he dodges it and runs off. He runs into a bush and trips a sliding door, which drops down behind him. It traps him in a cage. He looks around for a way out, but sees the boys crowd in.]"
24,11,10,Butters Stotch,Wow.
25,11,10,Stan Marsh,Cool.
26,11,10,Craig Tucker,No way.
27,11,10,Token Black,Whoa.
28,11,10,Jason,Wow.
29,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[making his way through, out of breath] Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!"
30,11,10,Leprechaun,You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
31,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[gets out a Bowie knife] Tell me where the gold is or you die! [unsheathes it] Slow! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him out and disappears]"
32,11,10,Stan Marsh,Where'd he go? [the leprechaun appears on a tree limb behind the boys; they turn to look at him again]
33,11,10,Leprechaun,"I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him away and disappears]"
34,11,10,Craig Tucker,Dude.
35,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle and clears his throat] Kyle, suck my balls. [brings out the contract both of them signed. Kyle stands motionless]"
