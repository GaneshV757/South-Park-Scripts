0,11,4,Mrs Garrison,"All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem."
1,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh! [Kyle's seat is empty, and he fears the worst]"
2,11,4,Mrs Garrison,"Welcome to our class, Baahir."
3,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",Thank you.
4,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Duhude, dude, [throws out his arms, palms out] not cool!"
5,11,4,Mrs Garrison,Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?
6,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems","Okay. [goes to Kyle's seat. Cartman begins crawling out of his, away from Baahir]"
7,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo."
8,11,4,Mrs Garrison,"[stopping him. What follows is in hushed tones] Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!"
9,11,4,Eric Cartman,"What's wrong? [looks at Baahir, who's looking back at him, then looks back at Mrs. Garrison and takes her aside] Has he been checked for bombs?"
10,11,4,Mrs Garrison,"Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!"
11,11,4,Eric Cartman,"No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them."
12,11,4,Butters Stotch,"[slides down gleefully] Now you go, Baahir. [Baahir climbs the ladder steps and slides down. Butters cheers him on. Cartman shows up and looks at them. Baahir dusts himself off. Cartman turns and walks away, then places a call on his cell phone]"
13,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,[sniffs - he has a stuffy nose] Yeah?
14,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[hushed] Kyle, are you on your computer?"
15,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What? No, I'm sick. [sniffs]"
16,11,4,Eric Cartman,Get online. I need you to check something for me.
17,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, leave me alone."
18,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!"
19,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,[sits right up] What? Why?
20,11,4,Eric Cartman,Get online now!
21,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, all right. [leaves his bed and goes to his computer, sits down and starts clicking]"
22,11,4,Eric Cartman,Go to MySpace. [enters the school building] See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
23,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[types a search term at MySpace] Baahir Hakeem. [Baahir's page pops up] Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?"
24,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[begins walking down the hallway] Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?"
25,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Over a hundred.
26,11,4,Eric Cartman,[walks further along] Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
27,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,White Stripes
28,11,4,Eric Cartman,[stops suddenly] That's funny.
29,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?
30,11,4,Eric Cartman,He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
31,11,4,Eric Cartman,[voiceover] The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
32,11,4,Officer Barbrady,Hello?
33,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[entering the boys' restroom, still in hushed tones] Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! [checks the toilet stalls on all fours]"
34,11,4,Officer Barbrady,From what? Who is this?
35,11,4,Eric Cartman,I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
36,11,4,Officer Barbrady,Are you serious?
37,11,4,Eric Cartman,"If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?"
38,11,4,Officer Barbrady,Like what?
39,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect."
40,11,4,Officer Barbrady,Oh jeez.
41,11,4,Mrs Garrison,What the hell?
42,11,4,Principal Victoria,[over the PA system] All students are to evacuate the school immediately! [Baahir looks around]
43,11,4,Butters Stotch,"Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?"
44,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems","Sure, okay. [12:02:32 pops up on screen and ticks the seconds away.]"
45,11,4,Butters Stotch,Well all right! [they walk off together]
46,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. [sniffs and calls Cartman. The LED readout vanishes]
47,11,4,Eric Cartman,[exits the building through a side door and answers the call] Yeah. [walks among various trash cans and bins]
48,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school."
49,11,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
50,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,I guess so.
51,11,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
52,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Wuh what doesn't follow?
53,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion. [starts running] Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!"
54,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
55,11,4,Eric Cartman,Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
56,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks up the info as Cartman talks] Yeah. Actually, there is."
57,11,4,Eric Cartman,[stops] What?
58,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally. [Cartman stays silent] Cartman? ...Cartman? [Cartman has turned off his phone and runs out of school]
59,11,4,Head Agent,Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.
60,11,4,Head Agent,"What? [takes the call] This is CIA head, Alan Thompson."
61,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!"
62,11,4,Mr Thompson,What do you know?
63,11,4,Eric Cartman,He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
64,11,4,Mr Thompson,I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
65,11,4,Eric Cartman,I said I will only talk to the President!
66,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-"
67,11,4,Eric Cartman,LALALALALALALALA!
68,11,4,Mr Thompson,I will have you arrested for-!
69,11,4,Eric Cartman,LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
70,11,4,Aide,"Call is coming through now, Mr. President."
71,11,4,George W. Bush,Hello?
72,11,4,Eric Cartman,"President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?"
73,11,4,George W. Bush,Huh? Who.
74,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!"
75,11,4,George W. Bush,Hildog?
76,11,4,Aide,"Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know."
77,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"What is it, Brian?"
78,11,4,Brian,"Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today."
79,11,4,Hillary Clinton,Is the thread credible?
80,11,4,Brian,"We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. [behind him, the rally gets closer and closer]"
81,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly."
82,11,4,Driver,"We've reached the rally site, Hildog."
83,11,4,Aide 2,"Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine."
84,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"Thank you, Chris. [leaves with Brian and a third aide. The driver walks off in the opposite direction, and Chris whips out a cell phone. He walks forward and calls someone]"
85,11,4,Chris,They know about the bomb!
86,11,4,Blond Russian,That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.
87,11,4,Chris,"Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened."
88,11,4,Blond Russian,That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!
89,11,4,Chris,"The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!"
90,11,4,Blonde Russian,Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.
91,11,4,Chris,"I understand, comrade."
92,11,4,Blonde Russian,Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.
93,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!"
94,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,So then maybe you're wrong.
95,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?"
96,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
97,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?"
98,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [Cartman giggles and sticks the phone down his pants, in front of his genitals. He takes the picture and sends it to Kyle. Kyle receives it on his computer] What is that?"
99,11,4,Eric Cartman,It's my balls! [laughs as Kyle just looks at the image]
100,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,God damn it Cartman!
101,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[his laugh dies down, then] Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here."
102,11,4,Mayor McDaniels,"People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! [the crowd cheers and holds up pro-Hillary signs: ""Hildog"", ""In Hildog We Trust"", ""Hildog, we love you!"", ""Hildog #1 fan"", ""South Park Wants Hildog!!"", ""Hildog '08"", ""We Love You""]"
103,11,4,Hillary Clinton,[affecting a Southern accent] It is so nice to be back in a small town like the one I came from. [more cheers for her]
104,11,4,Hildog Fan,Here we go! [his friends don dog-headed helmets and start barking.]
105,11,4,Brian,"Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat? [""You know, when I start my life in office, quite a few changes have to be made!""]"
106,11,4,Otis,"We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it. [the third aide has the pig on a leash, letting it roam as it will]"
107,11,4,Hillary Clinton,This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is in towns like South Park that you find the true America! [more cheers go up as aide and pig move around]
108,11,4,Aide 3,"Oh my God, she got a scent! [the pig walks faster]"
109,11,4,Brian,What?!
110,11,4,Aide 3,The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!
111,11,4,Brian,[getting nervous] Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!
112,11,4,Aide 3,"Come on, find it. Find! [the pig leads him up the steps to the stage]"
113,11,4,Brian,"My God, they hid it under the stage?!"
114,11,4,Female Aide,"No wait, look. [the pig approaches Hillary and really wants to get at that bomb]"
115,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh... [the pig buries its snout in Hillary's ass] on the education of all- Woo haha, whoa there, girl. Haha, [puts some distance between herself and the pig, but the pig won't back off] uh, uh, on the education of all children. [the pig tries the groin this time] Oh, I declare!"
116,11,4,Otis,Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...
117,11,4,Head Agent,"Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her..."
118,11,4,Mr Thompson,In her what?
119,11,4,Head Agent,"In her snatch, sir."
120,11,4,Mr Thompson,What?!
121,11,4,Hillary Clinton,What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.
122,11,4,Brian,"Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing. [receives a call and answers it] Yes."
123,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch."
124,11,4,Brian,A what?!
125,11,4,Mr Thompson,A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.
126,11,4,Brian,"No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!"
127,11,4,Mr Waters,"Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke."
128,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"What is goin' on, Brian?"
129,11,4,Brian,"Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz."
130,11,4,Hillary Clinton,[fans herself in a Southern fashion] Oh my.
131,11,4,Brian,What do we do? Can we disable the timer?
132,11,4,Mr Thompson,It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.
133,11,4,Brian,But then that means...
134,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever."
135,11,4,Mr Thompson,Do we have that phone trace?
136,11,4,CIA Vice Head,"[hands him the phone] The call is going through now, sir."
137,11,4,Eric Cartman,[gets the call] Yeah? [walks through a parking lot]
138,11,4,Mr Thompson,"This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the- [he and his agents walk down the street. Two angles are shown of that, and a third image of Cartman walking through the lot]"
139,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Mr. Thompson?"
140,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Well, we've just arrived in your town."
141,11,4,Eric Cartman,Why? Did you find something?
142,11,4,Mr Thompson,Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.
143,11,4,Eric Cartman,[stops] A snuke?
144,11,4,Mr Thompson,That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
145,11,4,Eric Cartman,[walks again] I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
146,11,4,Mr Thompson,"We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop."
147,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. [the framing for the two scenes is removed to reveal the one image of Cartman standing next to the CIA agents. They look at each other]"
148,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Oh, hey."
149,11,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we totally got let out of school."
150,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos."
151,11,4,Stan Marsh,Russian?
152,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, this guy. [a YouTube profile page is shown] Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally."
153,11,4,Stan Marsh,So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
154,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?"
155,11,4,Stan Marsh,Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
156,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Oh that's a good idea. [does the search]
157,11,4,Mr Hakeem,What is going on? What have we done?
158,11,4,Mr Thompson,They claim they don't know anything about an attack.
159,11,4,Eric Cartman,Big surprise!
160,11,4,Police Officer,"Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere."
161,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?"
162,11,4,Mr Hakeem,We thought he was at school. He's not at school?
163,11,4,Brian,"You're doing great, Ms. Clinton."
164,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?"
165,11,4,Brian,"They'll find the detonator, Hildog."
166,11,4,Aide 3,"We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?"
167,11,4,EOD Leader,[part of the bomb squad] I'm not sending any of my men in there.
168,11,4,Chris,Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
169,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running. [the detonator is shown with its LED readout: 12:34:10... 12:34:11... 12:34:12... 12:34:13... ]
170,11,4,Agent 2,"Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!"
171,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"I tell you, I do not know."
172,11,4,Agent 2,"[sighs, then leaves the room with the female agent and enters the adjoining control room, where Mr. Thompson is waiting] This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying."
173,11,4,Eric Cartman,Let me have time with him.
174,11,4,Female Agent,What are you going to do?
175,11,4,Eric Cartman,We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him! [removes his cap and goes in] You will tell me where your son is!
176,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"He should be at school! [Cartman walks off and brings back a stool, setting it against Mr. Hakeem's chair. He climbs up and stands on the stool, drops his pants, and starts farting.] Hey!"
177,11,4,Eric Cartman,[farts] Where is the detonator?!
178,11,4,Mr Hakeem,Wuh-what detonator are you ta-
179,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[farts some more, and again, and again] I can do this aaall day."
180,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"[coughs] I don't know anything about a- [Cartman farts a short one, and then a long one that makes Mr. Hakeem turn away] Aawwwwgh [holds his breath, gasps for air and coughs] Stop it! Really!"
181,11,4,Eric Cartman,You can make it stop!
182,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"[almost weeps] I don't have the- [Cartman farts for a long time, and the female agent turns away from the one-way window]"
183,11,4,Female Agent,Are we just gonna let this go on? [Cartman continues farting]
184,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay."
185,11,4,Stan Marsh,You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. [CIA agents enter the room quickly with their equipment]
186,11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area. [Stan steps down for a better look at the activity]"
187,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hey.
188,11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Donner, take over that station. [points to Kyle. Donner walks over and shoves Kyle off his chair]"
189,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,[stands up] What's going on?
190,11,4,CIA Vice Head,This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!
191,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,...Homeland Security?
192,11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!"
193,11,4,FBI Leader,"'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!"
194,11,4,CIA Vice Head,I am!
195,11,4,FBI Leader,[more people come in] Yeah well not anymore you're not. This apartment has just been assigned to the FBI.
196,11,4,CIA Vice Head,That's outrageous! On whose orders?!
197,11,4,FBI Leader,"On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!"
198,11,4,ATF Leader,"[more people come in] Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!"
199,11,4,Secret Service Leader,[more people come in] Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.
200,11,4,Nelson,[bursts into the scene] Not anymore I'm not! [everyone else falls silent]
201,11,4,Mr Hakeem,What are you going to do to my wife?!
202,11,4,Eric Cartman,Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
203,11,4,Mrs Hakeem,We told you: we don't know.
204,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[whips around and shows them the syringe] Do you know what this is?! [they look at each other, unsure] This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. [injects himself with the syringe into the right arm and hops up on the stool next to Mrs. Hakeem]"
205,11,4,Female Agent,Did he just inject himself with apple juice?
206,11,4,Eric Cartman,Where is your son?!
207,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"She doesn't know either. [Cartman turns and drops his pants, and farts on Mrs. Hakeem's face]"
208,11,4,Mrs Hakeem,Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!
209,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?! [a phone rings and the camera zooms in on Mrs. Hakeem's shirt pocket. Cartman turns and reaches into the pocket, pulling out the cell phone]"
210,11,4,Eric Cartman,Answer it! [holds the phone to Mrs. Hakeem's right ear]
211,11,4,Mrs Hakeem,Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?
212,11,4,Eric Cartman,Butters.
213,11,4,Mrs Hakeem,"Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage. [Cartman drops the phone and farts a good gust of flatulence against Mrs. Hakeem's face] Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [Cartman drops off the stool and enters the control room.]"
214,11,4,Mr Hakeem,Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!
215,11,4,Eric Cartman,We got him! I know where he is!
216,11,4,Female Agent,"All right, where? We'll send our people in."
217,11,4,Eric Cartman,"No no, he's my lead. [opens the suitcase]"
218,11,4,Mr Thompson,You're not going alone.
219,11,4,Eric Cartman,You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! [gives himself a double injection of apple juice]
220,11,4,CIA Leader 2,"[white hair] All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com."
221,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
222,11,4,CIA Leader 2,Are you tellin' me how to do my job?
223,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
224,11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!"
225,11,4,Chase,Checking.
226,11,4,Stan Marsh,"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!"
227,11,4,Female Agent 2,"[with a stack of papers] Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat."
228,11,4,CIA Leader 2,Where's the intel from?
229,11,4,Female Agent 2,We just read it on Drudge Report.
230,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest."
231,11,4,CIA Leader 2,We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!
232,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,[he and Stan look at each other] ...Not anymore you're not.
233,11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Oh, snap. [walks off dejected]"
234,11,4,Butters Stotch,"[makes his move] Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. [outside, Cartman runs up to the window and crashes through it.]"
235,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Uuugh! [lies motionless for a few seconds, then gets up]"
236,11,4,Butters Stotch,Oh hey Eric.
237,11,4,Eric Cartman,[walks up to Baahir and grabs him by the collar] Where is the detonator!
238,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",The what?
239,11,4,Eric Cartman,You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
240,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",Leave me alone! [heads for the front door and walks out. Cartman follows him] Upta!
241,11,4,Butters Stotch,"[watches them leave] Hey, I was about to win!"
242,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! [A black van pulls up next to them and the side door slides open. Three real terrorists jump out and aim their semiautomatics at the two boys]"
243,11,4,Terrorist 1,"[olive-colored] Get in the van! [Both boys are scared, but Cartman backs away]"
244,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore."
245,11,4,Terrorist 1,[they aim their guns at Cartman] Get in the van!
246,11,4,Aide 3,"That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!"
247,11,4,EOD Leader,"No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!"
248,11,4,Brian,[overhearing it] I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.
249,11,4,Eric Cartman,Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
250,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!
251,11,4,Eric Cartman,That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
252,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,[aims the semiautomatic at him] Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
253,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Uhh yes, of course?"
254,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,"America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?"
255,11,4,Eric Cartman,The Russians?
256,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Before that.
257,11,4,Eric Cartman,The Germans?
258,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Before that.
259,11,4,Eric Cartman,The Germans again?
260,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
261,11,4,Eric Cartman,You can't possible mean...?
262,11,4,Captain,"Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown! [gets a call and answers it on his cell phone] Yes, Your Majesty?"
263,11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.
264,11,4,Captain,"Full sail, Your Majesty?"
265,11,4,Aide 3,"All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch."
266,11,4,Brian,"[diving in slowly, has radio communication with the booth] All right. I'm nearing her snizz now."
267,11,4,EOD Leader,God help him.
268,11,4,Aide 3,"What do you see, Brian?"
269,11,4,Brian,It's dark... cold...
270,11,4,Aide 3,"You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz."
271,11,4,Brian,"Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! [begins to cough]"
272,11,4,Aide 3,"You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there."
273,11,4,Brian,"There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... [static fills the transmission and the aide tries to restore communication]"
274,11,4,Aide 3,"Say again, Brian."
275,11,4,Brian,"[amid heavy static] There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!"
276,11,4,EOD Leader,"[takes control] Brian, get out of there!"
277,11,4,Brian,Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!
278,11,4,EOD Leader,"Brian? Brian, what's happening?"
279,11,4,Brian,"It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! [the camera zooms back to show his body gyrating helplessly, then being spit out by Mrs. Clinton's snizz]"
280,11,4,Hillary Clinton,Hoh my!
281,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British."
282,11,4,Female Agent 2,The British?
283,11,4,Agent 4,Loyalist Red Coats!
284,11,4,Chase,"Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!"
285,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,All right! MapQuest the address!
286,11,4,Chase,I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.
287,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Good thinking
288,11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now."
289,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,"[warmly shakes a terrorist's hand] It was good knowing you, comrade."
290,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.
291,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,"Yes, but we will be rich."
292,11,4,Head Agent,"[outside] Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go! [the doors to the hideout fly open and CIA agents pour in, with the CIA Vice Head supervising the riad]"
293,11,4,Mr Thompson,"[last to enter, gun drawn] The game is over! Get down on the ground!"
294,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,How did they find us?
295,11,4,Mr Thompson,We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!
296,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes! [the camera quickly moves to the detonator: 12:56:57 and counting. Four seconds later the power is shut off] What the hell?!
297,11,4,Head Agent,The power went out!
298,11,4,Mr Thompson,Well so then what time is it? [the power returns and the detonator's timer is reset to a blinking 12:00:00]
299,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Oh crap.
300,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Take 'em down! [the agents fire away. One after one, terrorists go down, dead. Vladimir climbs a wooden ladder to the hideout's roof]"
301,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,"No! I don't want to die without being paid! [an agent shoots him down, he hits the floor and blows up. CIA agents remove the ropes from Cartman and Baahir]"
302,11,4,Mr Thompson,"[places a call] The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed."
303,11,4,Captain,The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!
304,11,4,Soldier,How?
305,11,4,Captain,"Fire at will! [the soldiers quickly aim and fire. The bullets have no effect, as the jets simply unload their bombs on the ships and sink them.]"
306,11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,Yes?
307,11,4,Captain,"Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution."
308,11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,"I see. [sets the phone down, takes a loaded gun to her mouth, and shoots her brains out. She falls forward and hits the ground, dead.]"
309,11,4,Mr Thompson,"[walking into view] Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again."
310,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us."
311,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology."
312,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",Really?
313,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool."
314,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!"
315,11,4,Eric Cartman,"But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?"
316,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,...Maybe. [looks away]
317,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America."
318,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,...That is so missing the point.
319,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!"
320,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-"
321,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes or no, Kyle?!"
322,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
323,11,4,Eric Cartman,"But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? [Baahir's parents approach, looking around at all the activity in front of their house]"
324,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country! [Mr. Hakeem nudges Baahir forward, and the family leaves]"
325,11,4,Butters Stotch,Awwwww.
326,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh? [raises his own hand] That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice."
