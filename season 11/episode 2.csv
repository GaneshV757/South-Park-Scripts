0,11,2,Eric Cartman,"This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha. [the caption reads ""THE PIERRE 3/10/07."" Cartman flips the page. The pages are artsy in design] And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth. [Yep, the tampon is in there like a thermometer] I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"". [the caption is shown, Cartman flips the page. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny stand around him, looking at the pictures. They're all in Cartman's room.] This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"". [caresses the picture] I really like how the light plays with the background on this one."
1,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Is this all you brought us here to see?
2,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh no, there's much more. [flips the page] Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"". [a shot of Cartman hanging his ass over Butters' face] I did a whole study using my ass. [Cartman's ass over Butters' face from the left side] Here it is using some high-contrast stuff. [next, Cartman wearing darker pajamas, mooning Butters] trying out some... different light filters here. [last shot looks faded, with Cartman's ass directly on Butters' face.] But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass."
3,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Butters is staying over tonight?
4,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-"
5,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[appears at Cartman's bedroom door] Hey, fellas! [Stan and Kenny turn around. Kyle looks over his left shoulder]"
6,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Heh! [quickly puts away his scrapbook] Oh, oh hey, Butters! [turns around and greets him] I wasn't expecting you so soon."
7,11,2,Butters Stotch,Yeah. [puts down his sleeping bag] I finished my chores so I came over a little early. [Cartman takes the sleeping bag and sets it aside. Butters notices the other guys] Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
8,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[returns] No no, these guys were just leaving. [faces the other guys menacingly] weren't you guys?"
9,11,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go. [leads Kyle and Kenny out the door.]"
10,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops] Wait, wai- I can't let this happen. [turns around] Butters."
11,11,2,Butters Stotch,Yeah Kyle?
12,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
13,11,2,Eric Cartman,Kyyyle!
14,11,2,Butters Stotch,Uh what do you mean?
15,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I mean, that if-"
16,11,2,Eric Cartman,"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life."
17,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle."
18,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,[angered] Hrrugh! [leaves]
19,11,2,Butters Stotch,"So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?"
20,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon."
21,11,2,Butters Stotch,"But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30."
22,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink."
23,11,2,Eric Cartman,[off screen] You guys! I got it! [runs in and joins them] It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
24,11,2,Stan Marsh,What'cha do to Butters this time?
25,11,2,Eric Cartman,"It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! [cracks up at his own cleverness]"
26,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Dude!
27,11,2,Eric Cartman,"I know I know, check it out, look. [the other three crowd in and look at the picture] I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!"
28,11,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?"
29,11,2,Eric Cartman,Because that makes Butters gay now!
30,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, that makes you gay!"
31,11,2,Eric Cartman,Eh- ...what?
32,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!"
33,11,2,Eric Cartman,[looks more closely at the picture] Nuh uh.
34,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah huh!
35,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?"
36,11,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)"
37,11,2,Eric Cartman,"But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!"
38,11,2,Stan Marsh,You are now.
39,11,2,Eric Cartman,"No, no, it was a stupid mistake!"
40,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
41,11,2,Eric Cartman,"No, it was just for a second! [seeing that his plan has backfired, he puts the picture away] What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?"
42,11,2,Stan Marsh,You can't!
43,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman."
44,11,2,Eric Cartman,How?
45,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
46,11,2,Eric Cartman,[low voice] Really?
47,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
48,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[beat] ...Shit, I gotta find Butters! [runs off]"
49,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,[beat] ...Idiot.
50,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[singing] Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... [continues howling the tune]"
51,11,2,Eric Cartman,[enters the room] Butters.
52,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[stops playing and gets up] Whoa, hey Eric."
53,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you."
54,11,2,Butters Stotch,[a little excited] A surprise? What is it?
55,11,2,Eric Cartman,It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
56,11,2,Butters Stotch,[really excited] Oh boy!
57,11,2,Eric Cartman,You ready?
58,11,2,Butters Stotch,Y-yeah!
59,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!"
60,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and gets on his knees] Oh, okay! [Cartman grabs a handkerchief from his back pocket and makes a blindfold from it, then puts it on Butters]"
61,11,2,Eric Cartman,Hang on a second here. [makes sure the blindfold is on snugly]
62,11,2,Butters Stotch,"How come uh, I can't see?"
63,11,2,Eric Cartman,"'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? [rushes off to get the toybox]"
64,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh uh, ho yeah."
65,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] All right, that's good. [undoes his pants] Okay, open your mouth, Butters? [lowers them and ...] That's good, just like that."
66,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[wary all of a sudden] Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?"
67,11,2,Eric Cartman,"...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. [lifts up his shirt to show his massive gut]"
68,11,2,Butters Stotch,Well okay!
69,11,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, you ready? [grabs Butters' head and draws it closer to his own wiener] All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. [at that moment the door opens and Stephen enters.]"
70,11,2,Stephen Stotch,Butters!
71,11,2,Eric Cartman,Uh! [quickly gets dressed up]
72,11,2,Butters Stotch,Whoa! Hey Dad! [Cartman steps down from the toy-box and runs away]
73,11,2,Stephen Stotch,Butters! What are you doing?!
74,11,2,Butters Stotch,I'm getting a surprise! [points to his mouth]
75,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! [takes off the blindfold]"
76,11,2,Butters Stotch,[looks around] Hey. Where'd Eric go?
77,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"[quite concerned, on bended knee] Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?"
78,11,2,Butters Stotch,Like what?
79,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious."
80,11,2,Butters Stotch,What's... bi-curious?
81,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. [Linda appears at the doorway]"
82,11,2,Linda Stotch,"What's going on, you two?"
83,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. [smiles]"
84,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious."
85,11,2,Father Maxi,"Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?"
86,11,2,Butters Stotch,"...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright."
87,11,2,Stephen Stotch,You see?
88,11,2,Father Maxi,"Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you."
89,11,2,Butters Stotch,Really?
90,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"What can I do, Father?"
91,11,2,Father Maxi,"There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured."
92,11,2,Stephen Stotch,A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
93,11,2,Butters Stotch,Whoa boy! Camp!
94,11,2,Eric Cartman,Haahaahahaha! [crosses his arms] Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
95,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you talking about, fatass?"
96,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[uncrosses his arms] I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!"
97,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"You figured that out, huh?"
98,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[crosses his arms again as he turns away] That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. [pleased with himself]"
99,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Except for us.
100,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Right, except for you."
101,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,And all the people we tell.
102,11,2,Eric Cartman,[turns around] Why would you tell anybody?
103,11,2,Stan Marsh,"Because it's really, really funny."
104,11,2,Eric Cartman,"...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier."
105,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Like what?
106,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch. [grins, but Stan and Kyle ignore him] Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! [chuckles]"
107,11,2,Stan Marsh,That isn't funny.
108,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[angrily] Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!"
109,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't."
110,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys! [the other boys continue playing. Cartman changes tactics: he pleads] You guys, please don't tell anybody."
111,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on."
112,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle. [turns around and cackles] Haha, hahahaha! [leaves the house]"
113,11,2,Leader,"Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters."
114,11,2,Campers,Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.
115,11,2,Stephen Stotch,[brings the suitcase to an elder staffer] Thank you so much for taking him in.
116,11,2,Director,Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.
117,11,2,Director,"Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?"
118,11,2,Butters Stotch,Because I'm bi-curious?
119,11,2,Director,"That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy. [they approach a room] Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy. [Room 22] Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life. [the door opens, and a boy is shown hanging from a noose in the middle of his room. The stool and book he stood on are fallen on the floor. The director quickly closes the door and continues the tour] Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there. [notices another boy in front of them] Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?"
120,11,2,Bradley,"Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6"
121,11,2,Director,Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
122,11,2,Butters Stotch,I'm bi-curious.
123,11,2,Bradley,Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.
124,11,2,Director,"That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed. [(a boy has hanged himself) whispers softly to a staffer as the staffer walks by] We've got another one: Room 22."
125,11,2,Staffer,"Aw, darnit!"
126,11,2,Stan Marsh,"Aw man, I've got H O R S now. [steps aside as Kenny receives the ball.]"
127,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, my turn. [Kenny gives him the ball and Kyle prepares to shoot. Cartman approaches the park behind him]"
128,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Where is it, you filthy Jew?!"
129,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,[throws up the ball] Where's what?
130,11,2,Eric Cartman,[grabs Kyle by the collar and shakes him violently] You know God damned well what!
131,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Let go of me.
132,11,2,Stan Marsh,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!"
133,11,2,Eric Cartman,"I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone! [shakes Kyle again] What did you do with my picture?!"
134,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture.
135,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[rolls up his sleeves] Give it back, Kyle!"
136,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,I don't have it.
137,11,2,Eric Cartman,"I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now, [puts up his fists as if to box] I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here."
138,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Shut up.
139,11,2,Eric Cartman,"You shut up! You're lying, and [points an accusing finger at Stan and Kenny] you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews! [Kyle punches him on the right arm once, firmly] OW! [puts his left hand over his right arm] OW! AAAAUH! [grimaces, turns around, and runs out of the park] NYAAAAAAAAAA!"
140,11,2,Campers,The Lord is love this forWith Jesus I can just say noAnd not be confused anymore.
141,11,2,Director,"We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you."
142,11,2,Butters Stotch,He's bi-curious too?
143,11,2,Director,"Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!"
144,11,2,Pastor Phillips,"[flies onto the stage and prances about speaking flamboyantly] Helloooo campers! [twirls some and strikes a pose] Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man! [strikes a running pose] So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what? [jumps up into the air and does a 1080] It worrrrked! [strikes another pose, then eases up]"
145,11,2,Director,"That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip. [pulls on out of his back pocket] And just like a paper clip, [begins to mess with it] God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight. [presents the straightened paper clip. A Latino boy pulls out a gun, shoots himself through the temple, and goes down. Butters is startled. The director and Pastor Phillips just stand there.]"
146,11,2,Det Yates,So you say you were robbed. [fills out a police report]
147,11,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski.
148,11,2,Det Yates,"If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?"
149,11,2,Eric Cartman,"It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!"
150,11,2,Det Yates,"Okay, what is the picture of?"
151,11,2,Eric Cartman,[long pause] Why... why does that matter?
152,11,2,Det Yates,Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?
153,11,2,Eric Cartman,All right. It's a picture ...of me.
154,11,2,Det Yates,Yes?
155,11,2,Eric Cartman,It's a picture ...of me. [long pause] And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
156,11,2,Det Yates,[long pause] You were sucking somebody's penis. [this grabs other officers' attention.]
157,11,2,Eric Cartman,"No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!"
158,11,2,Det Yates,...I see.
159,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep."
160,11,2,Det Yates,"Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury."
161,11,2,Eric Cartman,I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
162,11,2,Det Yates,"Well then, you're screwed."
163,11,2,Director,You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
164,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Well sure, I guess."
165,11,2,Bradley,Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.
166,11,2,Director,And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
167,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, sure."
168,11,2,Bradley,"So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7."
169,11,2,Director,Then do you mind telling us why we found this [holds up a magazine with an aroused male model on one of its pages] 1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?
170,11,2,Bradley,That's... that's mine.
171,11,2,Director,You know this is strictly forbidden!
172,11,2,Butters Stotch,Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
173,11,2,Director,"[rises from his chair and walks up to Butters] What's wrong?! [thrusts the magazine onto Butters' face] This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!"
174,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Yes, it's all very confusing!"
175,11,2,Director,"This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids! [a gunshot and body drop are heard off screen and all the adults present look to their right. The director sighs twice, rests his left elbow on his desk, holds his left hand up, drops his head onto it, and closes his eyes. The other staffers take notice. Bradley looks down, Butters looks down, then around] Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!"
176,11,2,Eric Cartman,That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now. [pounds his desk and gets determined] That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth. [grabs his ears and starts twisting them until they hurt] Ow. OW. OW!
177,11,2,Liane Cartman,"[taking notice] Eric? What's the, what's the matter? [walks over to him to console him]"
178,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[crying throughout] I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow."
179,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened."
180,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee."
181,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, now why would he do that?"
182,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre."
183,11,2,Liane Cartman,"What is the picture of, Eric? [Cartman stops crying]"
184,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[sniffles] Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have."
185,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Ohh, that's nice."
186,11,2,Eric Cartman,"But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. [turns his face to the wall and cries again]"
187,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen."
188,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[looks at her and sobs] But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. [turns to her and cries into her chest]"
189,11,2,Liane Cartman,"It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother."
190,11,2,Eric Cartman,"You, you will?"
191,11,2,Butters Stotch,...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
192,11,2,Bradley,"Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble."
193,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Awww, that's okay, Bradley."
194,11,2,Bradley,"I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused."
195,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!"
196,11,2,Bradley,"You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great. [warm thoughts... Bradley panics and leaves his chair] Uh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!"
197,11,2,Butters Stotch,Wuh-what's the matter?
198,11,2,Bradley,"I think, I, I th-, I think I like you."
199,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Well I like you too, Bradley."
200,11,2,Bradley,You do?
201,11,2,Butters Stotch,Well yeah!
202,11,2,Bradley,You like like me?
203,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Sure, I like like you a lot lot. [laughs]"
204,11,2,Bradley,"Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! [runs to the door and opens it, then runs out and away]"
205,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[gives chase, but isn't fast enough] No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!"
206,11,2,Sheila Broflovski,Hello?
207,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother."
208,11,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman."
209,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth."
210,11,2,Sheila Broflovski,[long pause] Excuse me?
211,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine."
212,11,2,Eric Cartman,It is? [happily jumps off his chair and runs to her] Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! [hugs her]
213,11,2,Liane Cartman,You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
214,11,2,Eric Cartman,[his smile vanishes] What?
215,11,2,Liane Cartman,She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
216,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Mom, she's lying!"
217,11,2,Liane Cartman,"She said she was sure, Eric."
218,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!"
219,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it."
220,11,2,Eric Cartman,[thinks a moment] Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh.
221,11,2,Director,Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
222,11,2,Butters Stotch,"I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast."
223,11,2,Director,"You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk."
224,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh no, my Dad?"
225,11,2,Director,"Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you, you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?"
226,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'."
227,11,2,Director,We're fixing your confusion!
228,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"There you are, Butters!"
229,11,2,Director,Oheh- hey Dad.
230,11,2,Stephen Stotch,What's he done now?!
231,11,2,Director,"Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!"
232,11,2,A counselor,"They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick! [Butters runs out, followed by Stephen, then the counselor, then the director]"
233,11,2,Director,"Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!"
234,11,2,Bradley,Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!
235,11,2,Director,"No no, we're fixing you!"
236,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone? [Kyle turns around and Cartman is in his face. Cartman softly says] Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!"
237,11,2,Mrs Garrison,"Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell. [writes the words on the board] Who'd like to go first? [Cartman holds down Kyles arm while raising his own and grunts]"
238,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Ow! Quit it, dude!"
239,11,2,Mrs Garrison,"Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first."
240,11,2,Eric Cartman,"HA! [gets up and goes to the board, pulls down the projector screen and clears his throat.] For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer. [clicks the projector on, and the class lights dim] This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" [a shot of snow-covered barren trees], a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?"
241,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,[to Stan] He isn't actually going to show everyone...
242,11,2,Eric Cartman,And now this next picture [clears his throat. Quick cut to]
243,11,2,Director,"Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!"
244,11,2,Bradley,It's too late.
245,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[approaches the bridge] Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?"
246,11,2,Director,You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.
247,11,2,Bradley,I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
248,11,2,Butters Stotch,"You're perfectly normal, Bradley."
249,11,2,Director,Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
250,11,2,Butters Stotch,[gets angry] All right. All right that does it! [turns around and faces the crowd] I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was! [Bradley listens] You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
251,11,2,Bradley,Yeah.
252,11,2,Butters Stotch,"I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! [Bradley thinks about this]"
253,11,2,Bradley,I think. I think I'd like to come down now.
254,11,2,Director,He's coming down! [everyone begins to chatter] We did it! [stops by Bradley as Bradley climbs back onto the bridge's road] Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!
255,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change."
256,11,2,Butters Stotch,No. I like bein' bi-curious.
257,11,2,Stephen Stotch,Well you know somethin'? So do I. [they both have a good laugh about it]
258,11,2,Butters Stotch,Wait. Now I am confused.
259,11,2,Eric Cartman,And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. [everyone gasps]
260,11,2,Bebe Stevens,Eww!
261,11,2,Clyde Donovan,[long pause] Dude.
262,11,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
263,11,2,Mrs Garrison,"Eric, what the hell is this?!"
264,11,2,Eric Cartman,"What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-"
265,11,2,Mr Mackey,"[at the door] Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother? [reads the message] ""Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk."" She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? [walks away. Cartman stands there looking at the door, then at the class. Kyle has a look of pity for Cartman on his face and blinks]"
266,11,2,Eric Cartman,[longer pause] ...Lame.
