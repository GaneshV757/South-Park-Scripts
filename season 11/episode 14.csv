0,11,14,Butters Stotch,[runs towards the table breathlessly] Fellas! Fellas! It's- Oh my god! You're not gonna believe this!
1,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Butters, calm down."
2,11,14,Butters Stotch,"Okay. [takes a gulp of air and looks around] Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest."
3,11,14,Craig Tucker,So who do they say is the cutest?
4,11,14,Butters Stotch,I dunno.
5,11,14,Token Black,Who do they say is the ugliest?
6,11,14,Butters Stotch,"I don't know. I-it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. [turns around and looks at them. The other boys look as well. Nearby, the girls chat among themselves, notice the boys, then laugh. Bebe holds up a notebook]"
7,11,14,Eric Cartman,[mad] They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
8,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?"
9,11,14,Clyde Donovan,If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
10,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time."
11,11,14,Eric Cartman,"[with a double cheeseburger in his left hand] Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about."
12,11,14,Craig Tucker,You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
13,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!"
14,11,14,Craig Tucker,You don't think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom?
15,11,14,Eric Cartman,"No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor."
16,11,14,Kenny McCormick,"(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)"
17,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married."
18,11,14,Butters Stotch,"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me."
19,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! [the boys look at each other for a few seconds]"
20,11,14,Eric Cartman,"All right, Bebe, let's see the list."
21,11,14,Bebe Stevens,[turns her head to look at him] What?
22,11,14,Eric Cartman,"You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!"
23,11,14,Bebe Stevens,That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
24,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him?"
25,11,14,Bebe Stevens,"I'm not... [slams her locker door shut] telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! [sticks her tongue out and blows a raspberry at him, then walks away]"
26,11,14,Eric Cartman,"[blows a strong raspberry back and flips her off] Fuck you, Bebe! Fuck it, bitch!"
27,11,14,Butters Stotch,"[disappointed] Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls."
28,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them."
29,11,14,Eric Cartman,"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right? She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her. [points to a chalkboard with his plan on it] This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"". [a map with routes of the plan laid out]"
30,11,14,Butters Stotch,[happily taking notes] Neat-o!
31,11,14,Eric Cartman,"At 1 PM tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here. [upper center part of the map] When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls."
32,11,14,Butters Stotch,[cheerfully] Okay!
33,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?"
34,11,14,Nelly,"Ow! What'dja do that for?! [Butters looks down and kicks her in the groin again] Hey, what's your problem, asshole?! [Butters is stunned that his kicks have no effect on her]"
35,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Bail, bail! [he and Kenny take off]"
36,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls."
37,11,14,Butters Stotch,[shown with a black right eye and his right arm in a sling] They sure don't.
38,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time"". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground."
39,11,14,Butters Stotch,You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
40,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! [continues]"
41,11,14,Eric Cartman,We got it! We got it! [next shot is of Stan at his locker as Craig runs by]
42,11,14,Craig Tucker,"We got the list from the girls! [the other boys take pursuit: Stan, Token, Jimmy, Clyde, Tweek, Bill, and two others. Two sixth graders and some kindergartners watch from the far end of the hall]"
43,11,14,Nelly,[chasing after the boys] Give that back you dirty buttholes! [the boys run into the boys' room]
44,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! [Kyle is washing his hands, but he turns to see what's going on]"
45,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!"
46,11,14,A Boy,Hurry hurry!
47,11,14,Craig Tucker,"Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?"
48,11,14,Clyde Donovan,What number am I on?
49,11,14,A Boy,Is it set up?
50,11,14,Stan Marsh,It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
51,11,14,Clyde Donovan,Me? [smiles] I'm the cutest? [grins]
52,11,14,Stan Marsh,"And then Token, and then me."
53,11,14,Token Black,I'm number two? Wow.
54,11,14,Butters Stotch,"[making his way to the front] Come on, let me see! Let me see! [looks at the list and begins to scan it for his own name, then finds it] Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! [runs out of the bathroom as a few boys wonder why he's so happy about it]"
55,11,14,Craig Tucker,"Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! [he's #12 while Cartman is #15]"
56,11,14,Eric Cartman,What?! That's bullcrap! [Kenny moves up past Cartman and looks for his name. He finds himself at #7]
57,11,14,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!) [moves off]
58,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and... [finds himself at #16, the last one on the list. His head drops a little] Me?"
59,11,14,Eric Cartman,"You're last, dude! [laughs heartily]"
60,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,No way.
61,11,14,Eric Cartman,Yes way! Check it out! [laughs heartily]
62,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last."
63,11,14,Eric Cartman,So? I'm hotter than Kyle. [makes his way through the crowd and out of the bathroom] I'm better looking than Kyyyle! [the other boys join him out except for Stan and Kyle] Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
64,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,I'm last? Last?
65,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?"
66,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
67,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Who cares what dumb girls think, right? [realizes there's no consolation now and walks away. Kyle stays there looking at the list. Alone. All alone. All alone in the boys' room]"
68,11,14,Butters Stotch,"Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!"
69,11,14,Stephen Stotch,"[holding a smoking pipe with his right hand and reading the Denver Post] Well good for you, Butters."
70,11,14,Linda Stotch,"Way to go, champ."
71,11,14,Butters Stotch,Whoopie! [flies off to his room]
72,11,14,Stephen Stotch,"Well, guess we don't have to ground him."
73,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes."
74,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
75,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,What? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
76,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I-I didn't think I was the very ugliest."
77,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,"You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. [Gerald looks at Kyle and flashes a smile]"
78,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God! I do?
79,11,14,Gerald Broflovski,But he has his mother's nose.
80,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,[slaps both hands on his own nose] Ah!
81,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way."
82,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no? [Ike looks at him, then at their parents, then back at him. Kyle takes this to mean yes, and so leaves his chair] You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!"
83,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, come back here! [a door slams shut]"
84,11,14,Eric Cartman,"I'm better looking than you! [knocks on the window again] The girls think I'm better looking than you, Kyle! [Kyle sighs, stands on his bed, and pulls on a drawstring to close the curtains. Cartman moves with the curtain until he can no longer see inside Kyle's room] Dude, Kyle! Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are! [knocks] Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive! [knocks again. The curtain is fully closed and Kyle goes back to sleep] Kyle?"
85,11,14,Betsy Donovan,"[checking in on Clyde] Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed. [Clyde looks at his mom, who closes the door, then turns back to the mirror]"
86,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"[raises his right eyebrow and knits his left one, then strikes a pose] Hey, what's goin' on? [looks at himself from the side] What's goin' on? Hey. [checks out his ass and then strikes another pose] Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice."
87,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
88,11,14,Two Girls,Hey Clyde.
89,11,14,Clyde Donovan,Hey.
90,11,14,Anne,Hi Clyde.
91,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"What's goin' on? [Kyle is dismayed, but he hears Butters running up to him]"
92,11,14,Butters Stotch,[laughing] Hey ugly! [runs off. Kyle then walks forward]
93,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"[stops him] Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay? [Kyle remains sad] You know, Abraham Lincoln was super ugly too, but look what he accomplished. [Kyle is no happier] Chin up, cowboy. [leaves to talk to a girl nearby] Hey, what's goin' on? [the girl smiles]"
94,11,14,Blond Girl,"Oh, not much, just hanging around-"
95,11,14,Butters Stotch,"[returns to taunt Kyle some more] Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! [runs off laughing]"
96,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"Butters, that's not cool, man. [takes off after him] He can't help how he looks. [the girl walks away]"
97,11,14,Eric Cartman,"[walks up] Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right? [Kyle stays mum, as before] Cool. [walks away. A few seconds later, Kyle's eyes pop open]"
98,11,14,Blonde Boy,Hey.
99,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello. [the girl takes a sip of her milk, then lowers the carton]"
100,11,14,Bushy Eyebrows Boy,"[with bushy eyebrows] Are you going to eat your pickle? [Kyle just picks it up and hands it to him. The boy takes it and starts eating it, slowly]"
101,11,14,Craig Tucker,Could somebody toss the football back? It's over there next to the ugly kids. [the ugly kids just watch quietly. Kyle is more and more depressed]
102,11,14,Big Eared Boy,I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
103,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
104,11,14,Big Eared Boy,Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
105,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[leans away, then stands up] No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!"
106,11,14,Fat Girl,We're not?
107,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover."
108,11,14,Bushy Eyebrows Boy,Hey yeah.
109,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[to the girl wearing glasses] Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses. [removes them, and is met with tiny little eyes. The girl smiles after a few seconds] Let's just... put those back on. [puts them back on the girl, goes back to the steps, sits down and buries his head in his arms with a sigh. A few seconds later, Stan walks by and stops. He looks at the group helplessly. A few seconds later, he walks up to the merry-go-round, where Wendy, Lola, and Red are chatting]"
110,11,14,Lola,"I know, that song is so awesome. [Red notices him]"
111,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you?"
112,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Of course, Stan. [the other two girls smile]"
113,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Just for a minute. Over here. [takes her aside, to a tree nearby]"
114,11,14,Lola,[to Red] You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him?
115,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
116,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made."
117,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,Which one? We make lists all the time.
118,11,14,Stan Marsh,"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?"
119,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"[walks off a bit] Well, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-"
120,11,14,Stan Marsh,[walks up next to her] So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
121,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's not just something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
122,11,14,Stan Marsh,Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
123,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"[thinks for a moment] All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy."
124,11,14,Bebe Stevens,"Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor."
125,11,14,Red,If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?
126,11,14,Bebe Stevens,Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
127,11,14,Girls,Sunshine.
128,11,14,Lola,"Deliberating ""Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse""? Millie has the floor."
129,11,14,Millie Larsen,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that [motions to her left] Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's."
130,11,14,Blond Girl,"I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest."
131,11,14,Bebe Stevens,The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
132,11,14,Lola,Sunshine sparkle. Wendy has the floor.
133,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we... [glances at Stan] That we reopen last week's list for debate."
134,11,14,Girls,[debating] What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!
135,11,14,Heidi Turner,Is she crazy?
136,11,14,Bebe Stevens,"All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. [Stan and Wendy walk into the center of the room]"
137,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,Go ahead.
138,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?"
139,11,14,Red,You thought you should be number one?
140,11,14,Stan Marsh,NO.
141,11,14,Bebe Stevens,Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
142,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
143,11,14,Bebe Stevens,"I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?"
144,11,14,Girls,Sunshine.
145,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,They all laugh at me! [flicks on] And the girls giggle behind my back! [flicks off] unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
146,11,14,A Voice,"Do not burn down the school, Kyle. [Kyle looks around]"
147,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Who said that?
148,11,14,A Voice,I did. [a body appears in the room to match the voice - it's Abraham Lincoln's glowing ghost] Do you know who I am?
149,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Abraham Lincoln?
150,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see. [walks out] I want you to look in here. [they approach a random house and look inside. A bored woman is playing with a pencil and pebble at her small dining table] This woman is Nancy Pinkerton. As a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school. Her life as a youth was filled with praises, and everything being handed to her. Boys told her she was special. She was funny. She was interesting. But that's only because she was hot. It wasn't until she reached age 40, when her looks started to fade, that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special, as a wet carrot. [they leave her as they found her, playing with a pencil, all alone in her dining room. They move on to the next house] This is the home of your new ugly friend, Yamal. [Yamal is shown playing a piano] Because he's ugly, he gets nothing handed to him. He has to work at making something of himself. But that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult. He will have character, something that kids who are hot rarely develop. Like your classmate, Clyde. [they approach Clyde's house. Clyde is all cool laying on his couch talking to someone on the phone] Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special."
151,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too."
152,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed."
153,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
154,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,You must be patient.
155,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
156,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,[sighs] Very well.
157,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you."
158,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
159,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Well then you're just a fucking asshole! [drives off. Kyle, stunned at that comment, just looks on.]"
160,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something! [Stan gets off the chair and walks up to the desk] Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle."
161,11,14,Stan Marsh,I have no idea what you're talking about.
162,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. [they look at each other, smiling]"
163,11,14,Red,"Oh, hey Wendy."
164,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
165,11,14,Red,"[laughs it off] Oho Wendy, we're done with that list."
166,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-"
167,11,14,Red,"[menacingly] All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy! [looks around to make sure no one else is listening] You might not like... what you find! [begins to draw close to her] Just back off and stop asking questions! [in Wendy's face] You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go! [backs up into her house and closes the door]"
168,11,14,Stan Marsh,"That didn't sparkle with her, did it?"
169,11,14,Clerk,"[the name tag says Jerry] One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid, [Kyle stands there with determination in his eyes] seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches. [the total is $82.32] Okay, is that everything, little boy?"
170,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,[determined] That should just about do it.
171,11,14,Jerry,Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?
172,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one."
173,11,14,Lola,Why would she do that?
174,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here. [drops the report on the table] We need to remake that list. [the girls look at the list as Wendy returns to Stan]"
175,11,14,Jenny Simons,You just couldn't let it go! [puts her left hand on the report]
176,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in."
177,11,14,Jenny Simons,"I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy! [the other girl leaves the table]"
178,11,14,Lola,"Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father owns the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough."
179,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,[points at her] You knew!
180,11,14,Lola,"[pulls out a folder] Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one!"
181,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
182,11,14,Jenny Simons,Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!
183,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,[stunned that her best friend was in on this] No. Not Bebe.
184,11,14,Jenny Simons,She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.
185,11,14,Stan Marsh,What's going on?
186,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-"
187,11,14,Jenny Simons,"Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simply generate a new list! ""Biggest Liars""! And put you at the top!"
188,11,14,Lola,"Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!"
189,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"I don't think so! [goes up and kicks Lola in the groin, hard, much to Stan's shock]"
190,11,14,Lola,"[doubling over, dropping the folder] AAGH!"
191,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"[grabs the folder and runs away] Stan, run!"
