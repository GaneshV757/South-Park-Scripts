0,11,5,Randy Marsh,"[inside] ...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade."
1,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. [sets it into the egg tray]"
2,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?"
3,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Wha... what do you mean, ""Why do we do this?"" It's Easter!"
4,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Right, so, why do we color eggs? [Shelly makes a cross face]"
5,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them."
6,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but why?"
7,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins."
8,11,5,Stan Marsh,So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
9,11,5,Randy Marsh,That's right.
10,11,5,Stan Marsh,"You don't see the missteps in logic with that? [Randy is unfazed, while Shelly, Sharon, and Marvin look at Stan disapprovingly] Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information."
11,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!"
12,11,5,Stan Marsh,[leaves his seat] I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
13,11,5,Randy Marsh,What is wrong with him?!
14,11,5,Sharon Marsh,"Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. [continues dying her egg. Randy slams his palms down on the table angrily. Sharon is taken aback.]"
15,11,5,Randy Marsh,[rising] You know so little! [leaves]
16,11,5,Eric Cartman,"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!"
17,11,5,Mall Bunny,"Ahh, don't you think that's-"
18,11,5,Eric Cartman,"Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!"
19,11,5,Easter Bunny Aide,Smile! [takes a picture and Cartman hops off]
20,11,5,Eric Cartman,"Bye, Easter bunny! [leaves]"
21,11,5,Mall Bunny,[watches him leave] Oh my God. [Stan walks up and sits on the bunny's lap. The bunny notices]
22,11,5,Stan Marsh,"All right, can you explain to me what's going on?"
23,11,5,Mall Bunny,Huh?
24,11,5,Stan Marsh,What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross? [no reply] It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times? [nudges him] Answer me!
25,11,5,Mall Bunny,"Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume."
26,11,5,Stan Marsh,I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
27,11,5,Mall Bunny,"Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid."
28,11,5,Stan Marsh,"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! [hops off and walks away]"
29,11,5,Mall Bunny,"I need a break. Can I have a break? [he gets it and walks up to some payphones nearby. He picks one up and dials a number] We have a problem. Somebody's onto us. Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions. Only a matter of time before he finds out what Easter's really about. Yes, I understand what must be done. Call the others. [hangs up the phone]"
30,11,5,Stan Marsh,Mom? Dad? [reaches the second floor] Anybody home?
31,11,5,Randy Marsh,"[voice only] Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! [Stan runs to the restroom door and pounds on it]"
32,11,5,Stan Marsh,Dad! You've gotta help me! [looks around]
33,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Hang on, I'm taking a crap."
34,11,5,Stan Marsh,Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
35,11,5,Randy Marsh,What?
36,11,5,Stan Marsh,"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want! [hears the front door breaking open] They're coming in! Dad, open the door! [the bathroom door opens and Randy looks out, wearing some bunny ears and a bunny snout with buck teeth.] Dad?"
37,11,5,Randy Marsh,"We... need to talk, Stan. [the Easter bunnies run up the stairs] Ih, it's okay guys."
38,11,5,Gray Hare,Randy?
39,11,5,Randy Marsh,Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
40,11,5,Purple Hare,Ohhh.
41,11,5,Randy Marsh,Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
42,11,5,Randy Marsh,"I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!"
43,11,5,Stan Marsh,Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
44,11,5,Randy Marsh,"We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us. [turns to face him] We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men."
45,11,5,Stan Marsh,"[not impressed, but curious] Does Mom know about this?"
46,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand."
47,11,5,Stan Marsh,I don't understand!
48,11,5,Randy Marsh,I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
49,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?"
50,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!"
51,11,5,Stan Marsh,So what is the secret of Easter?
52,11,5,Randy Marsh,"I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time."
53,11,5,Randy Marsh,"I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father."
54,11,5,Stan Marsh,Grandpa's in it too?
55,11,5,Randy Marsh,Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
56,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?"
57,11,5,Randy Marsh,"You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away."
58,11,5,Stan Marsh,"You mean the old Galveston Lodge? [Randy's taken aback at Stan's memory and so thinks about what to do next. After a while, he decides to remove the bag]"
59,11,5,Randy Marsh,Dammit.
60,11,5,Hare 1,Hey Bill.
61,11,5,Hare 2,Evenin' Marcus.
62,11,5,Hare 3,"Heh heh hey, look at you!"
63,11,5,Hare 4,Hey everybody.
64,11,5,Hare 5,"Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited."
65,11,5,Stan Marsh,Must I?
66,11,5,Marvin Marsh,There he is! There's my grandson!
67,11,5,Stan Marsh,Hi Grandpa.
68,11,5,Marvin Marsh,"I'm proud of ya, Billy."
69,11,5,Stan Marsh,...Stan.
70,11,5,Pink Hare,"Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit."
71,11,5,Hares,"Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
[two Hares carry the rabbit forward in a gilded cage]
Hippitus hoppitus reus Domine.
[they set the rabbit before the Pink Hare and everyone genuflects... except for Stan. Randy looks up and has him genuflect as well]"
72,11,5,Pink Hare,"All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!"
73,11,5,Hares,Hail Snowball. [all rise as the Pink Hare approaches Stan]
74,11,5,Pink Hare,"Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?"
75,11,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
76,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever."
77,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wanna know already."
78,11,5,Pink Hare,"Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that- [interrupted by breaking windows and ninjas pouring in]"
79,11,5,Gray Hare,They found us! [the other Hares arm themselves]
80,11,5,White Hare,"[with rainbow vest] Protect Snowball! [a door is turned down, and a ninja, a monk, and a layman enter the lodge. Another door breaks down and another monk enters with three ninjas]"
81,11,5,Brown Hare,"They're everywhere! [Hares and ninja battle each other, killing each other as Stan watches]"
82,11,5,Randy Marsh,"[approaches Stan with Snowball] Come on, we've gotta go! [a ninja spots him and quickly fires an arrow into his left leg. He stumbles] Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!"
83,11,5,Stan Marsh,Where am I supposed to go?
84,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Just get out of here! [Stan turns around and heads for the entrance. A ninja comes up behind him, but Randy grabs the ninjas leg and holds on, forcing the ninja to fall. The ninja tries to kick Randy off]"
85,11,5,Layman,Where is the rabbit?!
86,11,5,Hare 6,Where are you taking us?
87,11,5,Hare 7,"No! I'm not goin' anywhere! [the layman walks up and shoot him in the head, and he falls.]"
88,11,5,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ! [a monk has Randy restrained]
89,11,5,Layman,"Who did you give the rabbit to?! [slaps Randy, Randy spits back. The layman punches Randy in the stomach and has him rounded up with the others] Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far!"
90,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh no... [looks around, then runs off]"
91,11,5,Stan Marsh,Help.
92,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,What happened?
93,11,5,Stan Marsh,My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
94,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
95,11,5,Stan Marsh,"[enters anyway] Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me! [turns around and fires off a few questions] Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?"
96,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea."
97,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Nelson. [crawls towards him] Nelson? Nelson, say something."
98,11,5,Nelson,[reclining against a cage wall] My legs. I... I think they're broken.
99,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?"
100,11,5,Nelson,"Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... [coughs. Randy lets go and crawls back, but sees someone standing before him]"
101,11,5,Randy Marsh,You...
102,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi, we'd like to speak to a [reads the name from a slip of paper] Professor Teabag? [Stan is still carrying Snowball]"
103,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,What is it in regard to? [the professor appears at the far end with a walking stick]
104,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,The history of Easter.
105,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"[walks slowly towards the boys] Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures. [turns around and walks away]"
106,11,5,Stan Marsh,Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? [the professor stops and turns around]
107,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,The Keepers? [walks towards them] The Guardians of the Secret?
108,11,5,Stan Marsh,[the butler steps aside] My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
109,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,Come on in. [smiles]
110,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci. [on a large widescreen TV is a picture of The Last Supper] Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table?
111,11,5,Stan Marsh,Just bread...
112,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Really? Look to Jesus's right. [zooms in and pans to the lower left, then zooms in on an oval shape] The food which is a little different color than the others."
113,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,It kind of looks like... an egg.
114,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of... [zooms out and a bright trace appears around the disciple behind the egg] Saint Peter.
115,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,Who is Saint Peter?
116,11,5,Stan Marsh,He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
117,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. [the boys say nothing for a few seconds]"
118,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,[flatly] Peter Rabbit.
119,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely."
120,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,I don't see it.
121,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,Look closelier. [zooms in]
122,11,5,Stan Marsh,He looks like a guy.
123,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Look more closelier. [zooms in further, and a pair of rabbit ears appear on Peter's head] With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it. [Peter disappears from the picture and a rabbit appears next to the egg which was in front of Peter] That... is Saint Peter. [Stan jumps a bit] The original Pope of Christianity."
124,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,I don't believe it.
125,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat. [a picture of Benedict XVI appears] It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed... [a picture of a rabbit slides in next to that of the pope, and Teabag moves the hat from the pope to the rabbit] for a rabbit."
126,11,5,Stan Marsh,[looks at the professor] But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
127,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive."
128,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
129,11,5,Pope Benedict,You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
130,11,5,Randy Marsh,You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
131,11,5,Pope Benedict,Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
132,11,5,Randy Marsh,It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
133,11,5,Layman,"I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!"
134,11,5,Pope Benedict,The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
135,11,5,Randy Marsh,"I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore."
136,11,5,Layman,Take him to be tortured!
137,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian."
138,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"[the layman] You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! [a cardinal and a ninja open the door, take Randy in, and escort him to his torture.]"
139,11,5,Randy Marsh,"No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!"
140,11,5,Stan Marsh,I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
141,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne. [the butler is shown polishing a steel vase as some ninjas make their way towards the study]"
142,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"[notices some ninjas behind him] Mr. Teabag! Get out! [one of the ninjas runs his sword through the butler's head and out his face, killing him]"
143,11,5,Stan Marsh,They found me!
144,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Boys, get out of here! [takes them to a window and opens it] Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time. [Stan and Kyle climb down the ladder he's prepared for them]"
145,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"[off screen] Check upstairs! [the professor picks up a box of... PEEPS] Upstairs clear! Try the office! [Teabag takes the peeps to a microwave oven nearby and opens the oven's door. He puts the peeps in and sets the timer to 15 seconds. Behind him, two ninjas break into the study]"
146,11,5,Ninja 1,In here! [Teabag closes his eyes]
147,11,5,Ninja 2,"What's that? [the peeps begin to expand quickly and fill up the oven. Four seconds left, three, two, one...]"
148,11,5,Ninja 1,"PEEEEPS! [the oven explodes, spewing peeps everywhere and killing Teabag. Stan and Kyle are running away when they turn to see the whole mansion being destroyed by peep marshmallow]"
149,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,So what now?
150,11,5,Stan Marsh,If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
151,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
152,11,5,Stan Marsh,"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us! [softly] Wait... unless... maybe there is. [hands Snowball to Kyle] Here, hold this. [walks some distance away from Kyle and prays] Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. [waits for a long time, then peeks with his right eye, then with both, but there's no sign of Jesus. He opens his eyes wide, as normal, and looks up. Kyle looks down at Snowball]"
153,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
154,11,5,Announcer,"Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage."
155,11,5,Reporter,"As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection. [visitors whip out their cameras and take pictures] For this Easter vigil the Pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor, with a massive rabbit stew. [two chefs stand atop ladders next to a huge cauldron, slicing up ingredients. Bill and a ninja bring in a bunny to toss into the cauldron]"
156,11,5,Violet Hare,"NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m- [he's thrown in and is boiled to death] AAAAAAAAAAH!"
157,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, this seems extreme."
158,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.
159,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!"
160,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Ya see? [the three leave to meet this boy]
161,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!"
162,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Yes, hand it over!"
163,11,5,Stan Marsh,"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!"
164,11,5,Pope Benedict,We promise.
165,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"We swear it, on the cross."
166,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Just hand over the bunny, Stan!"
167,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Okay, fine. [a cardinal takes Snowball from Stan, and Randy is released]"
168,11,5,Randy Marsh,"[reaching his son] Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit."
169,11,5,Stan Marsh,"You said ""hand over the bunny."""
170,11,5,Randy Marsh,No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
171,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Take them into custody! [ninjas come in and put cuffs on Randy and the boys]
172,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what the hell!"
173,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need."
174,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These ""whores"" must be punished in front of everyone!"
175,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You swore on the cross, fatso!"
176,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! [cackles]
177,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Oh, we should've seen that coming!"
178,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian."
179,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,It is what Christ would've wanted!
180,11,5,Jesus Christ,[off-screen] Who are you to say that?! [the clerics look surprised. Jesus approaches them from the entrance of the basilica]
181,11,5,Pope Benedict,It... can't be.
182,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Jesus! [as Jesus walks, clergymen genuflect and bow to him]"
183,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus! [as Jesus walks, clergymen genuflect and bow to him]"
184,11,5,Singer,He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
185,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq."
186,11,5,Jesus Christ,I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
187,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, you did answer my prayer! [grins]"
188,11,5,Jesus Christ,"Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan."
189,11,5,Purple Hare 2,"Ohh, that's me Neato!"
190,11,5,Jesus Christ,"This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope."
191,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Kill him!
192,11,5,Pope Benedict,What?!
193,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,He goes against the Church. He must die!
194,11,5,Pope Benedict,"All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian."
195,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! [two ninjas apprehend Jesus]
196,11,5,Jesus Christ,What are you doing?! [two others arrest Benedict]
197,11,5,Pope Benedict,I am the Pope!
198,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord! [removes the papal tiara and places it on his own head] The Easter vigil will go on as planned! [walks to a clear spot with Snowball, so all could see.] Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!"
199,11,5,Jesus Christ,"What is your problem, guy?!"
200,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Lock up those two Jews! [referring to Kyle and Jesus] We'll deal with them later.
201,11,5,Stan Marsh,"No! No! [Stan and Randy are taken away in one direction, Kyle and Jesus in another, Benedict in still another]"
202,11,5,Reporter,"A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue"
203,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! [the crowds cheer loudly]
204,11,5,Randy Marsh,No! Listen! We aren't rabbits! [a ninja punches him in the stomach] Oof.
205,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Forgive me, Jesus."
206,11,5,Jesus Christ,We'll never get out in time to stop him!
207,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you have any superpowers?
208,11,5,Jesus Christ,"[throws the file away] Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me."
209,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
210,11,5,Jesus Christ,Stab me with this. [brings out a small dagger] If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
211,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,N-no way! Do it yourself.
212,11,5,Jesus Christ,"Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!"
213,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus."
214,11,5,Jesus Christ,Just make it quick. [kneels down and hands the dagger to Kyle] Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
215,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,[looks at the dagger in dismay] Don't make me do this.
216,11,5,Jesus Christ,"My son, there is no time! Do it!"
217,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,Eric Cartman can never know about this.
218,11,5,Jesus Christ,"I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter."
219,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Happy Easter, Jesus. [stabs Jesus in the neck, as ordered]"
220,11,5,Jesus Christ,"Awgh! [walks around for a few seconds, groaning and shedding blood here and there. He falls forward and his halo rolls away with a metallic ""clink""]"
221,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,...Jesus?
222,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! [a cardinal holds Snowball over the cauldron]"
223,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Sorry, little bunny."
224,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Snowball! [now dressed in rabbits ears and snout like Randy. A bright light appears near one of the obelisks in the center of the piazza, and Jesus' figure appears in the light. The light fades and Jesus is all alone. The crowd oohs and aahs]"
225,11,5,Tourist,Jesus?
226,11,5,Jesus Christ,Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!
227,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Why won't you go away?!
228,11,5,Jesus Christ,One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
229,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
230,11,5,Jesus Christ,"Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. [brings out a black and yellow glaive, then presses a button in the middle to release the blades, as in a switchblade. He throws it towards Bill, who runs from it. It levels off and slices through Bill's midsection and returns to Jesus. Jesus strikes a pose and catches it with his right hand. The blades disappear into their sheaths. Jesus brings out some sunglasses with his left hand and puts them on, still maintaining the dramatic pose.]"
231,11,5,Crowd At St. Peter's,YAAAY!
232,11,5,Stan Marsh,All right Jesus!
233,11,5,Crowd At St. Peter's,"Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine."
234,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives? [Snowball now sits on the papal throne. Snowball, having no human vocal cords, says nothing] It isn't saying anything."
235,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it."
236,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter."
237,11,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
238,11,5,Randy Marsh,That's my boy.
239,11,5,Crowd At St. Peter's,"[in the background] In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine."
