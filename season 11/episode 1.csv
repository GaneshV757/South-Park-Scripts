0,11,1,Announcer,And now back to Wheel of Fortune!
1,11,1,Pat Sajak,"All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!"
2,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Thanks, Pat!"
3,11,1,Pat Sajak,"You've got some family here watching tonight. [a shot of Sharon, Shelly, and Stan in the audience. Sharon waves, then claps. Stan waves]"
4,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, they're all rooting for me."
5,11,1,Pat Sajak,And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
6,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!"
7,11,1,Jimbo Kern,That's us!
8,11,1,Stephen Stotch,Hehey! [both thumbs up]
9,11,1,Man 1,"[amid other chatter, voice only] Hey Randy!"
10,11,1,Jimbo Kern,Good luck!
11,11,1,Pat Sajak,Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is [the words appear onscreen as Vanna White gets ready to turn the letters on the board] People Who Annoy You.
12,11,1,Randy Marsh,Okay. [deep exhale]
13,11,1,Pat Sajak,"As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E. [Some of the letters light up blue and Vanna turns them around: ERS] We just need three more consonants, and a vowel."
14,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G."
15,11,1,Pat Sajak,And a vowel?
16,11,1,Randy Marsh,[quickly crosses his fingers in both hands and grits his teeth] An O please.
17,11,1,Pat Sajak,"Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here. [more letters light up blue and Vanna turns them around. Randy claps softly] The category is People Who Annoy You. [the letters are NGG, but no O: N_GGERS. Randy stops clapping] Audience, keep quiet, please. [one of the cameramen peeks out from behind the camera - he's black]"
18,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Uh... Well, uh..."
19,11,1,Pat Sajak,"Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh."
20,11,1,Randy Marsh,I know it but I don't think I should say it.
21,11,1,Pat Sajak,"Five seconds, Mr. Marsh."
22,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle! [beat] Niggers! [the audience is stone quiet. The blacks in it are angry. Randy gets the buzzer for the wrong answer and drops his arms.] Huh? [Vanna goes to turn the last letter around - A - then walks back to her post and looks at the ground] Ohhh..."
23,11,1,Stan Marsh,[covers his eyes] Oooo. [Sharon and Shelly are stunned]
24,11,1,Randy Marsh,"[subdued] Oh naggers. Of course, naggers. [sheepish grin] Right."
25,11,1,Pat Sajak,"[awkwardly] Uhh, can we cut to a... [back at the bar in South Park] Can we cut to a- [the station goes off the air. The bar patrons are confused]"
26,11,1,Randy Marsh,"[sniffs, then] Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?"
27,11,1,Sharon Marsh,I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
28,11,1,Randy Marsh,"What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money."
29,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?"
30,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times."
31,11,1,Stan Marsh,Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
32,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token. [points at the camera. Dramatic music swells. The camera then looks at Token, who's putting some books into his locker] He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in."
33,11,1,Stan Marsh,No he's not. [looks at Kyle] Is he?
34,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
35,11,1,Stan Marsh,"I just need to explain things. [walks up to Token, who's finished with the locker and holds only a binder in his right hand] Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-"
36,11,1,Token Black,"Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning on the news."
37,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?"
38,11,1,Token Black,"Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan."
39,11,1,Eric Cartman,Ohhhhhhhh?
40,11,1,Token Black,"It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal."
41,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh shit here we go! [gets really excited and cuts in between them, yelling] It's on! Race war! [goes back and yells at one end of the hall] Race war! Race war! [comes back again and yells at the other end of the hall] Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! [returns, just itching to see Stan and Token fight]"
42,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it."
43,11,1,Token Black,"That's easy for you to say, Stan."
44,11,1,Eric Cartman,"[softly] Yeah, come on! Here we go!"
45,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that."
46,11,1,Token Black,That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
47,11,1,Eric Cartman,[softly] Race war! Come on! Race war!
48,11,1,Token Black,"If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not fighting anybody. [turns left and walks away]"
49,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Token forfeits! [takes Stan's left hand and holds it up in victory] Whites win! [lets go and twirls away] Whites win! [runs to one end of the hall] Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!"
50,11,1,Randy Marsh,"I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. [The camera shows Jesse Jackson behind a desk, with three officials around him]"
51,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"[elbows on armrests, hands interlaced] The puzzle you were solving was ""people who annoy you""."
52,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Uh well, like anybody else thought it was ""naggers"". I mean, right?"
53,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists."
54,11,1,Randy Marsh,Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with [making sure he gets it right] African-Americans.
55,11,1,Jesse Jackson,[thinks a moment] Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?
56,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Y-Yes, absolutely."
57,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"[long exhale] Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept. [rises from his chair and approaches Randy]"
58,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you."
59,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing. [takes off his coat, rolls up his shirt sleeves...]"
60,11,1,Brian,"[with camera] Ready to go, sir."
61,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"[...unzips and drops his pants, then drops his briefs and sticks his ass out at Randy] Kiss it."
62,11,1,Randy Marsh,Huh?
63,11,1,Jesse Jackson,Apologize. Kiss it.
64,11,1,Randy Marsh,You want me to kiss your-
65,11,1,Jesse Jackson,That's right. [gyrates his butt around] Apologize.
66,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh... [genuflects] Let's see here uh..."
67,11,1,Jesse Jackson,[gyrates his butt around again] Apologize. [Randy kisses Jesse's ass for a few seconds and the picture is taken. It appears in newspapers like the New York News]
68,11,1,Stan Marsh,Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
69,11,1,Token Black,"Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now."
70,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, yeah."
71,11,1,Token Black,"[throws his backpack into the locker] You just don't get it, Stan!"
72,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!"
73,11,1,Token Black,"[spins around angrily] Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! [storms away]"
74,11,1,Stan Marsh,[softly] He told my dad he was...
75,11,1,Woman at the gym,"[dressed in a sharp business suit] Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words. [Stan looks over at Token in the row before him] In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself, a little person. Who knows what a little person is? [Butters raises his hand] Yes? Over here?"
76,11,1,Butters Stotch,A midget?
77,11,1,Woman at the gym,"Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!"
78,11,1,Mr Nelson,"[waddles in to some fanfare, swaying back and forth] Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today? [the music stops. Cartman chuckles, then lets out a laugh, and can't stop] I would like to share with you all my-"
79,11,1,Eric Cartman,No! Dude! No fucking way! [laughs] Dude! [resumes laughing]
80,11,1,Mr Nelson,"That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-"
81,11,1,Eric Cartman,"[shakes his head back and forth, then rears back, laughing all the while] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha..."
82,11,1,Mr Mackey,"[appears next to Mr. Nelson] Eric, be quiet!"
83,11,1,Mr Nelson,"No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon. [Cartman continues laughing, and even nudges Stan a few times to get him to laugh, but Stan just gets annoyed.]"
84,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. [resumes laughing. Mr. Nelson gets pissed off, but holds it in]"
85,11,1,Randy Marsh,Ooh! An African-American performer at the comedy club. [rushes over]
86,11,1,"Coyote Brown, Laugh Factory Comedian","And so I said to my wife, ""You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!"" [the audience laughs. Randy is in the audience, laughing] We've got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how many people here are actually from Colorado? [a few audience members and Randy clap and holler] Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh? [that gets a big laugh from the crowd. The comedian points to Randy] Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? [the crowd falls silent, and Randy looks uncomfortable] Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said ""nigger"" on Wheel of Fortune. [the audience laughs. Randy lets out a weak chuckle] Look! Everybody! It's the ""nigger"" guy. [big laughs all around]"
87,11,1,Man 2,"Hey, it is him."
88,11,1,"Coyote Brown, Laugh Factory Comedian","Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the ""nigger"" guy. [waves, and the audience waves with him] Say, ""Hi, 'nigger' guy!"""
89,11,1,Audience,"Hi, ""nigger"" guy! [Randy waves back and now has a guilty smile on his face, which quickly changes to a guilty frown]"
90,11,1,"Coyote Brown, Laugh Factory Comedian","That's all right, ""nigger"" guy. You know we just playin'. [the crowd roars with laughter and claps]"
91,11,1,Randy Marsh,Yeah... No problem...
92,11,1,"Coyote Brown, Laugh Factory Comedian","Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're right out of ""Far Out Space Nuts"". Maybe ""nigger"" guy has one. You got one, ""nigger"" guy? [the audience roars with laughter again and Randy leaves, his head hung in shame. He wanders the streets]"
93,11,1,Man 3,"[walks by with a woman] Hey look, Betty. It's that ""nigger"" guy. [Randy sighs and walks on]"
94,11,1,Three kids,"[passing by on skateboards] Nigger guy. Nigger guy. [they leave, Randy sighs again and walks on. He stops by a 24-hour store to get some aspirin]"
95,11,1,Convenience Store Clerk,[white] Hey. What do you think you're doing? [an Asian clerk stands behind him]
96,11,1,Randy Marsh,I just... need some aspirin.
97,11,1,Convenience Store Clerk,"You aren't welcome in this store, ""nigger"" guy."
98,11,1,Randy Marsh,Fine! [leaves the aspirin on the counter and rushes out the door]
99,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Principal Victoria, I am very concerned about the behavior of one of your students."
100,11,1,Principal Victoria,"Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible."
101,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all. [waddles to his left] Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me. [waddles back] I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks."
102,11,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?"
103,11,1,Mr Nelson,"You don't understand. [waddles around] You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-"
104,11,1,Mr Mackey,"Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson."
105,11,1,Principal Victoria,"Very well, Mr. Nelson. [presses a button on her phone] Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman. [the door opens and Cartman walks in and immediately bursts into laughter upon seeing Mr. Nelson.] Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people."
106,11,1,Eric Cartman,[stops long enough to respond] Oh. Did I hurt its little feelings? [resumes laughing]
107,11,1,Mr Nelson,"You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless."
108,11,1,Eric Cartman,"[before Mr. Nelson finishes talking] Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! [stomps his foot on the floor, points to Mr. Nelson, and laughs. Principal Victoria buries her face in her hands]"
109,11,1,Mr Nelson,"You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing."
110,11,1,Eric Cartman,[stops] Barely! [starts up again]
111,11,1,Mr Nelson,"[assertively] No matter how you act, I can rise above it!"
112,11,1,Eric Cartman,"[stops] ""Rise above it!"" Get it? [starts up again]"
113,11,1,Mr Nelson,[steps up to Cartman] Shut your fucking mouth!
114,11,1,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Nelson! [Mr. Nelson blanches. Cartman looks at him, then cracks up again and falls on his ass in laughter]"
115,11,1,Mr Nelson,"He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking"
116,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!"
117,11,1,Mr Nelson,[grimaces] Aaaaaaa!
118,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how I try, people just say ""Hey! There's that 'nigger' guy."" [no response from the crowd] Everywhere I go, it's always the same. Everyone just thinks of me as that one single name. ""Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Hi Nigger Guy!"" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. When will it end, will there ever be a time? When I can be thought of as more... than just ""Nigger Guy"". [no response from the crowd] Respect. [throws up the V sign and walks off stage]"
119,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Token! Hey, wait up. [Token turns around] I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that ""little person"" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word."
120,11,1,Token Black,Sooo black people are midgets? [turns around and walks away. At the far end of the hallway Mr. Nelson rounds the corner and walks towards Stan.]
121,11,1,Stan Marsh,God dammit!
122,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Excuse me, over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here. [heads towards the gym. The available students follow him]"
123,11,1,Mr Nelson,"I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, ""Hello, fatso!"""
124,11,1,Craig Tucker,"...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir."
125,11,1,Mr Nelson,"He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets. [turns around and sees Cartman] All right all right, here he comes. [walks off-screen. Cartman enters the gym]"
126,11,1,Three Kids,"""Hello, fatso!"""
127,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?! [walks up to Kyle accusingly] Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?! [Mr. Nelson walks out towards the entrance, then curves around to stand behind Cartman] I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!"
128,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Now you know how it feels. [Cartman turns around and looks at him, then bursts out laughing] You'd better shut up or i'm gonna kick your ass!"
129,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!"
130,11,1,Randy Marsh,"And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation. [gets good applause for that] It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the ""nigger"" guy. [no response] You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on ""Wheel of Fortune"", you know and... and when people call me... ""nigger guy""... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. [no response]"
131,11,1,Black Man in convention audience,"Is this ""nigger"" guy serious?"
132,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! [walks off.]"
133,11,1,Driver,Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
134,11,1,Skeeter,"[the redneck in the cab] Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! [reaches down and grabs a shotgun. Randy takes off running.]"
135,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Awww! Awwww! [the rednecks give chase. Skeeter just shoots in the air, aiming at no one]"
136,11,1,Skeeter,Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
137,11,1,Passenger,Wooo! [pumps his left fist]
138,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Whoa! [sees a clearing across the street and runs into it. The truck passes it, screeches to a halt, and backs up. Randy turns around and sees the three rednecks standing before him, shotguns aimed at him]"
139,11,1,Skeeter,"Where you goin' ""nigger"" guy?"
140,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Please I, I don't want any trouble."
141,11,1,Skeeter,"Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on ""Wheel of Fortune""!"
142,11,1,Driver,"Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, ""nigger"" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance."
143,11,1,Passenger,"You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!"
144,11,1,Randy Marsh,[holds his hands out in a blocking position] What do you want?
145,11,1,Skeeter,What do we want? [he and the passenger laugh] We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!
146,11,1,Man 4,"[from screen left, out of nowhere] Leave him alone."
147,11,1,Passenger,"Hey... That's that other ""nigger"" guy."
148,11,1,Skeeter,Huh?
149,11,1,Passenger,"That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times."
150,11,1,Driver,"Michael Richards? Well, son of a bitch!"
151,11,1,Skeeter,"Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two ""nigger"" guys!"
152,11,1,Man 5,[from screen right] Make that three.
153,11,1,Passenger,Mark Fuhrman?
154,11,1,Skeeter,Who?
155,11,1,Passenger,He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.
156,11,1,Driver,"Well what is this? A ""nigger"" guy convention? [two more men appear beside Randy, Richards and Fuhrman]"
157,11,1,Michael Richards,We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.
158,11,1,Driver,"Come on, Skeeter. [he and the other rednecks back up towards their truck] These ""nigger"" guys ain't worth our trouble."
159,11,1,Skeeter,"[from the truck bed] Damn ""nigger"" guys! [the other two get into the cab] We'll be back! [the truck starts up and the rednecks hoot and holler and fire off their weapons as they speed away]"
160,11,1,Michael Richards,[puts his hands on Randy's right shoulder] You'd better come with us.
161,11,1,Michael Richards,"Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee."
162,11,1,Randy Marsh,What's going on here?
163,11,1,Mark Fuhrman,[pours Randy a cup of coffee and gives it to him] We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence.
164,11,1,Scott,They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.
165,11,1,Michael Richards,We're all just like you.
166,11,1,Randy Marsh,"No. [smacks Richards' hand off his shoulder and puts the cup down] No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money."
167,11,1,Michael Richards,I made a mistake too. [moves forward a bit] I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.
168,11,1,Randy Marsh,You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
169,11,1,Michael Richards,"[turns around and gets in Randy's face] You really think that matters?! [moves to Randy's ear] You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damn ""nigger"" guy! [Randy swallows a bit] Oh, you don't like that, do ya?"
170,11,1,Randy Marsh,No.
171,11,1,Mark Fuhrman,"Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all."
172,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!"
173,11,1,Token Black,I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
174,11,1,Stan Marsh,I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
175,11,1,Token Black,"No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!"
176,11,1,Stan Marsh,"What the hell do you want from me?! [Butters appears across the street, rather out of breath. Upon seeing them, he runs over]"
177,11,1,Token Black,Nothing!
178,11,1,Stan Marsh,Then stop being mad!
179,11,1,Token Black,No!
180,11,1,Butters Stotch,"Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! [Butters runs off. Stan and Token look at each other silently then shrug, as they turn to follow Butters]"
181,11,1,Butters Stotch,"C'mon now Eric, come on now."
182,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate."
183,11,1,Eric Cartman,"It's a midget, dude."
184,11,1,Mr Nelson,"[""Down with the Sickness"" by Disturbed starts playing] Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point."
185,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Hahaha, no- no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. [the kids urge them to fight, and the match begins]"
186,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Senators, I know it is not normally considered ""American"" to ban words. [Randy is flanked by Fuhrman and Richards] But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term ""nigger guy""."
187,11,1,Senator 1,"""Nigger guy""?"
188,11,1,Randy Marsh,Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
189,11,1,Michael Richards,Yeah! That's right!
190,11,1,Randy Marsh,Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
191,11,1,Skeeter,[with his two friends] Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
192,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called ""nigger guys""? [the senators are somewhat shocked]"
193,11,1,Senator 2,"Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that ""nigger guy"" could become a slur that refers to all white people?"
194,11,1,Senator 3,I'm certainly not a nigger guy. I've never thought a racist thought.
195,11,1,Senator 4,"[black senator] Aw, come on, you're the biggest nigger guy in Washington."
196,11,1,Senator 1,"Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill. [raises his left hand] All those in favor to ban the term ""nigger guy""?"
