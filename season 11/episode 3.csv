0,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about."
1,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem. [points to Kyle, but blocks Kyle's view of his left hand with his right.] Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it."
2,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"No, I mean the problem of head lice. [a shot of the class] There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here."
3,11,3,Bebe Stevens,Somebody might have lice?
4,11,3,Class,Ewww!
5,11,3,Mrs Garrison,So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
6,11,3,Eric Cartman,Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
7,11,3,Kenny McCormick,(What? Fuck you!)
8,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice, we can stop it before it spreads. [the camera zooms in on Clyde, then on his hair...] Lice can live in anybody's hair. [...until the hair resembles a forest, with tiny houses built upon the individual hairs and a colony of lice walking around on the scalp below.]"
9,11,3,Male Louse,"[approaching a female louse with a growing louse egg resting in a nest built on a shaft] Hello, Kelly. How's my babih?"
10,11,3,Kelly,[sassily] You mean me or the little one?
11,11,3,Male Louse,I mean both.
12,11,3,Kelly,"Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay."
13,11,3,Male Louse,[holds onto one of the female's pincers] How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?
14,11,3,Kelly,"Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis. [a group of lice tug on a hair nearby and pull it down. Travis and Kelly look on. He lets go and walks towards the fallen hair] You okay?"
15,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in. [turns around] I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer. [turns away and walks off]
16,11,3,Lead Screener,"All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked. [The first students go behind the curtains. Craig takes off his hat and does the same]"
17,11,3,Butters Stotch,"Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair."
18,11,3,Stan Marsh,[looks to Kyle] What do you think happens if you do have it?
19,11,3,Eric Cartman,"[answering] They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. [Butters gasps]"
20,11,3,Craig Tucker,[leaves the curtain and puts on his hat] I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! [walks past the rest of the class]
21,11,3,Eric Cartman,This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
22,11,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hey! Fuck off!) [The screener waves Clyde forward and Clyde steps behind the curtain]
23,11,3,Lead Screener,Have a seat on the stool. [Clyde goes to the stool]
24,11,3,Lead Screener,"Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em."
25,11,3,Clyde Donovan,What?
26,11,3,Lead Screener,"You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?"
27,11,3,Clyde Donovan,Oh my God. Oh Christ no!
28,11,3,Lead Screener,"[writes a note and gives it to him] Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor."
29,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!"
30,11,3,Lead Screener,I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.
31,11,3,Clyde Donovan,Yes they are!
32,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","[approaching the group] Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem! [the other lice look at him] The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it."
33,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",And what do you base this on?
34,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","[walks up to a hair and draws a human head on it] Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being. [the other lice look surprised] If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it."
35,11,3,Older Louse,"Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense. [kneels and knocks on the scalp several times] Hello. Anybody? [the other lice begin to laugh.]"
36,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!"
37,11,3,Older Louse,Poodiggery and poppycock!
38,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation."
39,11,3,Older Louse,Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.
40,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[as security escorts him away] Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!
41,11,3,Clyde Donovan,This is so... embarrassing.
42,11,3,Girl,I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?
43,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"I have... I have AIDS. [his mother looks at him, astonished]"
44,11,3,Nurse,Clyde Harris? [Clyde goes in to see the doctor.]
45,11,3,Doctor,"[writing out a prescription] Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school."
46,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"[desperate] But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!"
47,11,3,Doctor,"[walks up to Clyde] Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there."
48,11,3,Clyde Donovan,...Sick!
49,11,3,Doctor,"This shampoo should take care of it. [hands him a bottle] Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them."
50,11,3,Kelly,Travis? Everything okay?
51,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope."
52,11,3,Kelly,Hope?
53,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? [water begins to drop down from on high]
54,11,3,Louse 1,It's raining? Now? [Other lice stop and notice. Turns out Clyde is taking a shower.]
55,11,3,Louse 2,[starts dancing] Woohoo! I love the rain! [other lice join in the play. Travis doesn't have a good feeling about this]
56,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Oh my God. [runs to Kelly and their egg] We have to get out of here!
57,11,3,Kelly,"What it, it's just rain."
58,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","We have to get out of here now, Kellih! [grabs the egg and runs off with Kelly. Other lice continue dancing in the rain while still others watch. One or two look around and notice a green liquid spreading over the scalp.]"
59,11,3,Louse 3,"What is that? [walks up to the leading edge, reaches down and grabs a gob of it. The liquid quickly eats through his pincer and he screams in pain. The leading edge of the liquid moves past him and leaves him trapped in the liquid, which eats at him some more]"
60,11,3,Lice,"Whoa! [the liquid finally finishes him off. The other lice see the leading edge of the liquid get closer to them, and they run] Ruuun! [some of them get overtaken by the liquid, which is now moving quickly over the scalp. The camera follows them until it finds Travis]"
61,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! [the lice that can, climb up the hairs while the others get swept up by the RID-X and killed]"
62,11,3,Kelly,"My God, Travis, they're all dying!"
63,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!"
64,11,3,Louse 4,What the hell is it?!
65,11,3,Louse 5,"Well it's okay, we're safe up here! [the hairs begin to sway back and forth as a strong wind begins to blow]"
66,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",I don't think so! [lice begin to be pushed off the hairs]
67,11,3,Louse 4,[blown away] OoOhOOOoooh!
68,11,3,Kelly,Travis!
69,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Kellih! Hang on!
70,11,3,Kelly,I can't... hang on!
71,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","You have to! For the babih! [Kelly's grip loosens. She tightens it, but the wind rips her from the pincer she was holding on with]"
72,11,3,Kelly,Nooooooooooo!
73,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo! [he's left alone on the hair with the egg, Hope]"
74,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?"
75,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?"
76,11,3,Mrs Garrison,With what?
77,11,3,Craig Tucker,"With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? [Clyde looks apprehensive, and Mrs. Garrison notices]"
78,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken."
79,11,3,Stan Marsh,Somebody in this class?
80,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"Uh, yes."
81,11,3,Class,Ohhhhh.
82,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Well who was it? [points to Kenny] It was Kenny, right?"
83,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"That doesn't matter, it's over."
84,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who! [points to Kenny again] It was Kenny, wasn't it?"
85,11,3,Red,"I wanna know who it was, too."
86,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!"
87,11,3,Eric Cartman,[pounds on his desk] That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
88,11,3,Class,Yeah!
89,11,3,Bebe Stevens,And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
90,11,3,Craig Tucker,How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
91,11,3,Butters Stotch,Yeah! Dumb girls!
92,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history. [the camera zooms in on Clyde again] Ulysses S. Grant-"
93,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Hope. Hope, you're alive. [he stands up to his full height and surveys the destruction all around him] My God... [a decomposed louse stands up and collapses on him] Heh?!"
94,11,3,Louse 6,Help me... Help meeee... [it falls away and dies]
95,11,3,Louse 7,"Travis. [Travis looks to his right] Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead."
96,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",How many survivors?
97,11,3,Louse 7,Just the six of us. And the Vice President.
98,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","[notices and throws the Vice President up against a hair] You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!"
99,11,3,Louse 8,What do we do now?
100,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[turns and faces the others] We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here. [the lice do as commanded]
101,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[the older louse] Who put you in charge?!
102,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[turns around] God did! When he killed my wife! [turns back and walks away]
103,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! [Opposite Cartman are Jimmy, Tweek, Clyde, Anne, Bebe, Red. and two other kids. With Cartman are Craig, Token, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Kevin, Butters, and Wendy]"
104,11,3,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later."
105,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!"
106,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,You know what? I'll bet it was you!
107,11,3,Eric Cartman,Me?!
108,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
109,11,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!"
110,11,3,Stan Marsh,You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
111,11,3,Eric Cartman,"That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. [Stan is stunned]"
112,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal."
113,11,3,Eric Cartman,And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! [Kenny makes an angry face]
114,11,3,Butters Stotch,"[sensing where this is going] Heh hey guys, what would I do?"
115,11,3,Bebe Stevens,Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
116,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
117,11,3,Clyde Donovan,Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
118,11,3,Eric Cartman,There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! [turns left and walks away. Clyde looks around]
119,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,It was him. It had to have been him!
120,11,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah... Or you. [they check out each other]
121,11,3,Louse 9,"Mark? Mark, you have to hang on."
122,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet."
123,11,3,Louse 8,How?
124,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!"
125,11,3,Louse 9,The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.
126,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!"
127,11,3,Louse 1,Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?
128,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!
129,11,3,Louse 9,I'm not leaving my husband.
130,11,3,Louse 11,Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.
131,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih. [turns around and walks away]
132,11,3,Louse 12,"[redhead, runs up to him] I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here."
133,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",I wanna go too.
134,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Not a chance.
135,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live."
136,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you. [to the redhead and the Vice President] Let's go. [the redhead moves] Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! [turns left and follows the redhead]"
137,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[tarries] Yeah. Right behind you. [pulls out a gun and cocks it]
138,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, lock that door, Craig! [Craig goes to lock the door]"
139,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What's this about, Cartman? [the boys are now seated on a bench against a wall]"
140,11,3,Eric Cartman,"I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice. [whips out a little propane torch from his right pocket] We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties. [whips out a lighter from his left pocket, strikes the lighter on, and uses the lighter to light the torch. He puts the lighter away. Clyde is scared now.] Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air."
141,11,3,Jimmy Valmer,Ur ur re- ur really?
142,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!"
143,11,3,Eric Cartman,"[figuring out how to respond] This is a scientific test, designed to-"
144,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
145,11,3,Eric Cartman,"I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!"
146,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
147,11,3,Eric Cartman,"If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!"
148,11,3,Craig Tucker,Yeah. That's true.
149,11,3,Jimmy Valmer,I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
150,11,3,Token Black,Yeah. Me neither.
151,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test."
152,11,3,Eric Cartman,Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
153,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, now everyone back over there! [the boys head back to the bench] We'll start with what I already know. [moves the heated coil tip over the blood sample. Only steam comes from it]"
154,11,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice."
155,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,It doesn't prove anything!
156,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle! [takes Kyle's Petri dish and ...the same thing happens] Huh, I guess you're clean. [tries another Petri dish]"
157,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over."
158,11,3,Eric Cartman,"It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! [sticks the tip into the Petri dish, causing the blood to heat up and jump out of the dish. He gets the blood all over himself, and for good measure, tosses the rest of the blood onto himself.]"
159,11,3,Token Black,What the hell?! [Clyde is scared shitless. Cartman turns the dish around to reveal the name: Kenny]
160,11,3,Eric Cartman,Kenny!
161,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,No way.
162,11,3,Craig Tucker,"You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny."
163,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! [silence for a second or two, then Kenny bolts for the door, pushing Craig aside, opening the door, and running down the hall]"
164,11,3,Louse 12,"We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone. [a vast space of... nothing, like a desert] I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real."
165,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.
166,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","So what exactly is your plan, Travis?"
167,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.
168,11,3,Louse 12,"Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you."
169,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name [closes his eyes] Kelly."
170,11,3,Louse 12,She was a lucky woman to have you.
171,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Luck had nothin' to do with it. [a gunshot from behind kills the redhead, who wobbles forward, then back and to the ground. The Vice President keeps his gun trained on her corpse]"
172,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[aims his gun at Travis] Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!
173,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Why you murdering bastard!
174,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!
175,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","What the hell do you want, Vice President?!"
176,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Walk! [Travis turns and walks, and the Vice President follows him, keeping the gun trained on him.]"
177,11,3,Craig Tucker,"Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! [points to the sock in his right hand]"
178,11,3,Clyde Donovan,What? What are you gonna do to him?
179,11,3,Eric Cartman,"He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen. [beat] Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! [they turn and head off]"
180,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"[his eyes wander as he thinks] You guys, wait. [the guys turn around]"
181,11,3,Eric Cartman,"What, Clyde?"
182,11,3,Clyde Donovan,I... nothing.
183,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, see you there! [the guys turn around and leave] Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!"
184,11,3,Token Black,Yeah!
185,11,3,Craig Tucker,Yeah!
186,11,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! [Clyde sees them leave, then backs up, scared]"
187,11,3,Mrs Garrison,Yello?
188,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students."
189,11,3,Mrs Garrison,What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!
190,11,3,Clyde Donovan,Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
191,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",That's good! That's far enough! [Travis stops and turns]
192,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",What are you going to do?
193,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!"
194,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!
195,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",It was a disaster! Disasters happen!
196,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!"
197,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis! [shoots out the knees of Travis's hind legs]"
198,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Damn you! Why?!
199,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not ""conscious,"" we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this! [plugs six bullets into Clyde's scalp]"
200,11,3,Clyde Donovan,[feeling the little stings] Ow. [reaches back to the base of his skull]
201,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",You die he- [looks up. Two fingers reach down and grab him. He screams like he's never screamed before as Travis watches the fingers take him away.]
202,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!"
203,11,3,Kenny McCormick,[restrained by Kevin and Bradley] (Not guilty!)
204,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Guilty! I thought so! [the boys pull down his hood and coat, and his shirt]"
205,11,3,Craig Tucker,"All right, let's do this!"
206,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?"
207,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! [the boys gang up on Kenny and give him the sock bath]"
208,11,3,Kenny McCormick,"Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!"
209,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Wait, wait!"
210,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait... stop it, stop it! [he walks away; the others stop and look at him] I can't let Kenny be sock-dried."
211,11,3,Craig Tucker,He had cooties and he lied about it!
212,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks over his left shoulder] Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?! [looks away] It was me."
213,11,3,Clyde Donovan,What?
214,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it."
215,11,3,Stan Marsh,"Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice. [walks up to him] Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!"
216,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Wait a-wait a minute, what?"
217,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh I get it. [walks up to Stan and Kyle] This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!"
218,11,3,Stan Marsh,You had head lice?
219,11,3,Eric Cartman,Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
220,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"[offscreen] You all had head lice! [the boys look up and off to the left. Mrs. Garrison walks up to them on the court] Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!"
221,11,3,Craig Tucker,I thought I was the only one.
222,11,3,Butters Stotch,Me too.
223,11,3,Eric Cartman,"But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! [the other boys join in the chant ""Sock bath!"" and gang up on Kenny once again]"
224,11,3,Kenny McCormick,Dudes!
225,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe. [blinks. A light shines on him and a vision of Kelly descends. Travis holds his left hand up as a visor to make sure he's not hallucinating] Keh... k-Kellih? [Kelly's apparition disappears, replaced by a fly. Travis climbs on to one of the fly's legs, and the fly takes off. After a long while, the fly alights on a new host and Travis drops to the ground, asleep. Members of a darker, buffer species of louse watch from the shadows. They prop him up and carry him away]"
226,11,3,Louse 13,"You are welcome here. [the colony here is well-developed, with entrances to dwellings going up several stories, making the hairs act as high-rise apartments. The residents there wave as he passes by] You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed."
227,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kellih! [at this point the camera pulls back, out of the hair, and out of the space between a pair of female legs. The camera pulls back enough to show an actress exiting her limousine.]"
228,11,3,Agent,"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie! [photographers start snapping away with their cameras]"
229,11,3,Angelina Jolie,Hello everyone! [scratches her groin through her dress] Hello!
