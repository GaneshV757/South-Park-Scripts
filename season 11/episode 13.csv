0,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Stan, you guys are good! [Stan and Kyle more their right arms around during a power chord, then quickly return to playing. The score is 15,594 points and climbs quickly. Randy watches from the kitchen doorway]"
1,11,13,Randy Marsh,"[sounding tired] Sharon, what are the boys doing?"
2,11,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together."
3,11,13,Randy Marsh,They can play guitar now?
4,11,13,Sharon Marsh,"No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play."
5,11,13,Randy Marsh,Ohhh.
6,11,13,Sharon Marsh,"If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish."
7,11,13,Randy Marsh,Hey yeah...
8,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! [a shot of the cheering CG crowd on the TV]"
9,11,13,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to Stan] So you boys like this music, huh?"
10,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero."
11,11,13,Butters Stotch,Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
12,11,13,Randy Marsh,"Well you kids wanna see something really cool? [the boys pay attention] Check this out. [walks away and picks up an electric guitar, and plugs in the amplifier. He puts his right foot on top of the amplifier and begins to play ""Wayward Son"" a half-step up.
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-"
13,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[irritated, interrupting] Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!"
14,11,13,Randy Marsh,[brightly] I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
15,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh."
16,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's stupid, Dad."
17,11,13,Randy Marsh,But... But this is real.
18,11,13,Eric Cartman,Real guitars are for old people.
19,11,13,Craig Tucker,"Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. [Randy stands there a few seconds, disappointed that the boys aren't interested. He takes off the guitar, leans it against the amplifier, and walks away.]"
20,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[turns back to the TV] Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. [the game starts up with a new song, and the boys behind them begin to cheer again]"
21,11,13,M C,"Are you ready to rock? [""Wayward Son"" begins to play from the top, and Randy begins to move, slowly raising his right hand into a victory sign, then swinging his arm all the way around a few times]"
22,11,13,Kansas,"""Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more""
[the first guitar solo follows and Randy is playing terribly. The video crowd begins to boo him.]"
23,11,13,M C,"Game over! You suck! [the words are displayed onscreen. Randy takes off the controller, sets it on the ground, and walks back to bed, leaving the TV on with the video crowd still booing him.]"
24,11,13,Butters Stotch,They're gonna do it!
25,11,13,Eric Cartman,"[so relaxed his fat blocks his chin from view] Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!"
26,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. [the points pile up and they near 100,000. After a final flourish, their readouts combine into one, showing 100,000 points. The boys congratulate Stan and Kyle]"
27,11,13,M C,You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!
28,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we are total rock stars now!"
29,11,13,Randy Marsh,[walks in with beer and slurred speech] You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! [the doorbell rings]
30,11,13,Stan Marsh,[takes off his controller and goes to answer the door] Hang on.
31,11,13,Man,Stan Marsh?
32,11,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
33,11,13,Man,"I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero."
34,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we did. [smiles]"
35,11,13,Mr Kincade,I'm impressed. [steps inside and gives him a business card] And I'd like to be your manager.
36,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, really?? [smiles an open smile] Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!"
37,11,13,Randy Marsh,No way!
38,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,For reals? [smiles]
39,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points."
40,11,13,Stan Marsh,That'd be awesome!
41,11,13,Mr Kincade,"So, we're in business then? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then grin as ""Wayward Son"" plays]"
42,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Well, what do you think?"
43,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer",I like it. That's these boys playing?
44,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[stops the tape] No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode."
45,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","That's pretty Goddamned impressive. [rises and serves himself a drink] Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. [Stan and Kyle smile to this news as Mr. Kincaid stands behind them]"
46,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[pumps his fist] Yes! You did it, boys."
47,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?"
48,11,13,Stan Marsh,Cool! [smile openly]
49,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,Cool! [smile openly]
50,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, this is a huge party."
51,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here."
52,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! [Ron Zappolo is shown - an elderly gent with gray hair and mustache]"
53,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. [Jabs is shown with a white tiger on his lap and two women around him]"
54,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero. [ooo's and applause follow. Stan and Kyle grin] Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house."
55,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there! [a football player wearing #6 is shown] Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!"
56,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God!
57,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer",Would you boys like to meet him?
58,11,13,Stan Marsh,Are you serious??
59,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero."
60,11,13,Jay Cutler,"Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys."
61,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Nice to meet you! [grins] I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday."
62,11,13,Jay Cutler,[a bit bothered] Thanks...
63,11,13,Guest at Party,"Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?"
64,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer",You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
65,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,Do we? He's a legend!
66,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks."
67,11,13,Tom Shane,"That, would be impressive."
68,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[takes Stan aside] Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool."
69,11,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
70,11,13,M C,You Rock!
71,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[clapping] All right, nice rehearsal, boys."
72,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?"
73,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, that's almost impossible."
74,11,13,Mr Kincade,"That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. [an assistant dressed in jogging outfit joins him behind Kyle]"
75,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, okay. Cool. [takes off his controller and follows Jim out]"
76,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[sighs] You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million."
77,11,13,Stan Marsh,Really? That'd be sweet.
78,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[turns around and points to Stan] I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back."
79,11,13,Stan Marsh,"What, you mean, Kyle?"
80,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score."
81,11,13,Stan Marsh,"But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system."
82,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[crosses his arms] Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd. [a shot of the video crowd cheering] I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings."
83,11,13,Mr Kincade,"You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course. [sees someone] Ah, Thad! [a boy about Stan's age approaches the table and takes a seat. He wears a controller on his back] Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis."
84,11,13,Thad Jarvis,Sup? [an air of superiority is suggested by his tilting his head back]
85,11,13,Mr Kincade,"That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? [puffs on a cigar]"
86,11,13,Thad Jarvis,Yup.
87,11,13,Mr Kincade,He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.
88,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?"
89,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do. [Thad stands on his chair, swings his controller around, and puts his right foot on the table.] Check this out. [All that is heard are the clicks of plastic on plastic] Pretty damn good, huh?"
90,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play ""John the Fisherman""? [Thad stops and launches into that song]"
91,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history."
92,11,13,Male Diner,"Ohoh, I love this song. [the other diners seem to understand the song the clicks are supposed to be making and begin to clap]"
93,11,13,Butters Stotch,"Wow wee, look at him go!"
94,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters the house] Hey dude, how'd it-? [he has his new controller, but he's dismayed at what he sees. The boys look at him and the game is shut off]"
95,11,13,Stan Marsh,"...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick."
96,11,13,Butters Stotch,"[into his hands, in a low hoarse voice.] Uh ohhh."
97,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up to Stan] Who is this?
98,11,13,Stan Marsh,"This is um, Thad Jarvis."
99,11,13,Thad Jarvis,Sup?
100,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?"
101,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while."
102,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,But it's our game. We bought it together.
103,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part."
104,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
105,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Don't put this all on me, Kyle!"
106,11,13,Eric Cartman,Oh my God this is so awesome.
107,11,13,Stan Marsh,"You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-"
108,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,I have been sick!
109,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!"
110,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[stunned for a few seconds] I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. [drops his controller next to Stan and walks out of the house, closing the door behind him]"
111,11,13,Craig Tucker,"Dude, this game rules."
112,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Let's just do this, all right? [a new round begins and Stan and Thad resume playing]"
113,11,13,Brett,Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?
114,11,13,Stan Marsh,"It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out."
115,11,13,Brett,"Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress."
116,11,13,Stan Marsh,[approaches the counter with a Guitar Hero game guide] Huh?
117,11,13,Brett,Have you ever heard of... [pulls out a different game from under the counter] Heroin Hero?
118,11,13,Stan Marsh,Hero-Heroin Hero?
119,11,13,Brett,Ihit's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.
120,11,13,Stan Marsh,And there's no score? No crowds?
121,11,13,Brett,[his voice gets soft and mellow as he speaks] No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.
122,11,13,The Dragon from Heroin Hero,Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.
123,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[playing quietly] Dude, this is awesome."
124,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer",How are they coming?
125,11,13,Mr Kincade,"No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days"
126,11,13,Mr Hart,"They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. [walks away. On the game screen, Stan's character is missing his notes and flailing about]"
127,11,13,Stan Marsh,Ugh. Damint.
128,11,13,Thad Jarvis,"Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?"
129,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[frustrated] Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play! [misses some more notes] No no, you know what?! Screw this! [the music stops] I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!"
130,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play."
131,11,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
132,11,13,Thad Jarvis,No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.
133,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!"
134,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?"
135,11,13,Stan Marsh,"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!"
136,11,13,Thad Jarvis,Yeah? Well how about this one? I quite. [drops his controller] I quit I quit I quit. [turns around and walks away] I quit I quit I quit. I quit. I quit I quit.
137,11,13,Stan Marsh,"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!"
138,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Stan, what is the matter with you?"
139,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! [Mr. Kincaid notices that Stan's tote bag is open and looks inside. He pulls out Heroin Hero]"
140,11,13,Mr Kincade,What is this?
141,11,13,Stan Marsh,Man...
142,11,13,Mr Kincade,Are you playing Heroin Hero?
143,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Just, just a little."
144,11,13,Mr Kincade,"No! [stands up] Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little! You know, you never catch the dragon!"
145,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!"
146,11,13,Mr Kincade,"You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!"
147,11,13,Stan Marsh,No problem.
148,11,13,Older Boy,"Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!"
149,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not done yet.
150,11,13,Younger Boy,"Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?"
151,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,No. You're thinking of somebody else.
152,11,13,Younger Boy,"Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points."
153,11,13,Older Boy,How come you're playing here now?
154,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, just go ahead and play, alright? [gets off the stool and walks away] Leave me alone. [walks up to the bar and takes a seat] Can I get a Fresca, please?"
155,11,13,Mick,"You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this."
156,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters."
157,11,13,Mick,"Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free."
158,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet."
159,11,13,Mick,"Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all."
160,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks, Mick."
161,11,13,The Dragon from Heroin Hero,"Catch me. Come on, catch me. [Stan is passed out on the couch with snacks all around him. Some knocks and the doorbell are heard, but Stan doesn't move] What's wrong? Follow me. Come on. [The door opens and Mr. Kincaid comes in]"
162,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Marsh? Stan, you got- [notices Stan passed out] Oh my God! [runs over to him and shakes him hard] Get up, Stan! Wake up!"
163,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Huh? What, uh?"
164,11,13,Mr Kincade,You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!
165,11,13,Stan Marsh,The dragon. Where did it go?
166,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[slaps Stan twice across the face] You've gotta pull it together! [shakes him hard again, then sees a glass of water nearby and throws the water at him, them shakes him hard again] Pull it together, Goddammit!"
167,11,13,Mr Kincade,Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom. [the boys cheer Stan on.]
168,11,13,Token Black,Go Stan!
169,11,13,Eric Cartman,"All right, Stan, you've got it, man!"
170,11,13,Token Black,"Yeah, Stan!"
171,11,13,Craig Tucker,"Dude, what's the matter with him?"
172,11,13,Butters Stotch,"He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero. [Stan staggers slowly] Come on, Stan! You got it!"
173,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Goddamnit, he's a mess! [Stan is moving around, but he's missing all the notes]"
174,11,13,Craig Tucker,"Oh man, I can't watch this."
175,11,13,Mr Kincade,What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! [a shot of the video crowd booing]
176,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Come on guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys leave, as to the couples and other spectators, leaving Stan alone with Mr. Kincade. Mr. Hart approaches Mr. Kincade.]"
177,11,13,Mr Hart,"The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed. [walks away. Stan stumbles and finally falls face first, throwing up]"
178,11,13,Mr Kincade,You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! [walks away. More shots of the video crowd booing. Stan looks at the crowd and begins seeing double]
179,11,13,Brett,"There he is! So, did you break a million yet?"
180,11,13,Stan Marsh,"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!"
181,11,13,Brett,"Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top."
182,11,13,Stan Marsh,I just wanna find something else to play.
183,11,13,Brett,"Have you played... [whips out a new game] Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it."
184,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?"
185,11,13,Brett,Sssure kid. Sure. [brings out a Cross Country Cruiser game]
186,11,13,Radio Host,"All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero. [Stan is startled] Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I Guess... they're not playing the game anymore."
187,11,13,Skid Row,"""Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
[Stan walks in and approaches Kyle. Kyle sees him and turns his back to him]
And when you needed me I came through"""
188,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?"
189,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you doing here? [""I paint a picture of the days gone by""]"
190,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Please, ih ih, it won't take long."
191,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. [""When love went blind and you would make me see."" Kyle walks over to the bar and serves himself some Fresca]"
192,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. [""I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes""]"
193,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! [""So that I knew you were there for me""]"
194,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there."
195,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! [""Time after time you were there for me""]"
196,11,13,Stan Marsh,"That isn't it at all. [""Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand""]"
197,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! [""Love letters in the sand - I remember you""]"
198,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I know. I need you. [Kyle glances over his shoulder, then turns around to face Stan] I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that... [turns around and face Kyle] ...with my best friend."
199,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?"
200,11,13,Stan Marsh,[awkwardly] Yeah.
201,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway."
202,11,13,Stan Marsh,I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
203,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,I don't really see the fun in... [turns around with fire in his eyes] ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
204,11,13,Stan Marsh,"What, you mean it?"
205,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself."
206,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[pats Kyle on the shoulder] Then let's go, dude! [walks forward. Kyle follows.]"
207,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops abruptly] Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here. [turns around and face Mick] Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?"
208,11,13,Mick,"Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?"

210,11,13,Stan Marsh,"All right, dude, let's do this. [Kyle's jaw drops and Stan is annoyed] What the hell? [what greets them is Randy on the couch in his underwear. Around him are a pizza slice, a bucket of chicken, a case of S'mores Schnapps, and other items. Randy is playing Heroin Hero]"

234,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you wanna play me next? [picks up Stan's controller and puts it on]"
235,11,13,Butters Stotch,"Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. [picks up Kyle's controller and puts it on, and both of them get to playing.]"
