0,11,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes."
1,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,Fine.
2,11,7,Stan Marsh,"[stops] Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people? [all around the basketball court homeless people loiter or sleep. There's one bum sleeping at center court. The boys walk up to him] Sir, could you move a little, please?"
3,11,7,Bum,Spare some change?
4,11,7,Eric Cartman,"[pinches his nose shut] Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house. [releases the pinch] Get out of here!"
5,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go. [a slow pan of the homeless around them] They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something."
6,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, what are we supposed to do?"
7,11,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)"
8,11,7,Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something."
9,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
10,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do."
11,11,7,Butters Stotch,[through a bullhorn] Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. [Stan and Kenny prepare the ramp at center court for Cartman]
12,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, thank you. [to Stan and Kenny] The ramp ready?"
13,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's all set."
14,11,7,Clyde Donovan,He won't make it.
15,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!"
16,11,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, here we go! Jimmy? [Jimmy starts the drum roll. Cartman takes off and picks up speed on his way to the ramp. Tweek and Bebe have their fists ready to pump for him. He leaves the ramp successfully, only to land on the bum and hit the ground without injury]"
17,11,7,Bum,Oh! Aww.
18,11,7,Eric Cartman,[jumps off his skateboard] Yes! I did it! [tosses his helmet away] I jumped over the homeless! [turns around] Yes!
19,11,7,Kenny McCormick,(Yehes!)
20,11,7,Stan Marsh,"That was a sweet idea, Kyle. [smiles]"
21,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"God damn it, that wasn't my idea!"
22,11,7,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? [silence for a few seconds]"
23,11,7,Fire Chief,"Well, I, I short of had an idea."
24,11,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Please, Mr. Valmer."
25,11,7,Mr Valmer,[the fire chief] We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at.
26,11,7,Other Members,"Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it."
27,11,7,Randy Marsh,"Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars."
28,11,7,Mr Valmer,"Ohh, that's a good one."
29,11,7,Mr Mackey,"Nice one, Randy."
30,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,Like it.
31,11,7,Mayor's Aide,That's like recycling.
32,11,7,Mrs Testaburger,"All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!"
33,11,7,Randy Marsh,"You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA."
34,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more."
35,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi. I've uh... [the man faces him] I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this. [hands him a bill] It's twenty dollars. [drops it into the tin can and backs up, smiling]"
36,11,7,Bum,Got any more?
37,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[frowns] No, that... I thought that was a lot."
38,11,7,Bum,"[turns around and walks off a bit, asking no one in particular] Spare any change?"
39,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,[sad at the lack of gratitude] You're welcome. [walks back into the house with his head down]
40,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh crap. [the doorbell rings and Kyle comes down to answer it. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman enter]"
41,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?"
42,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
43,11,7,Eric Cartman,There's a bunch outside my house too.
44,11,7,Bum,"[female] Spare any change, sir?"
45,11,7,Eric Cartman,No! Fuck off! [slams the door shut]
46,11,7,Stan Marsh,"I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on."
47,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,He did?
48,11,7,Eric Cartman,Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
49,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night."
50,11,7,Eric Cartman,You what?!
51,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason."
52,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, what were you thinking?"
53,11,7,Eric Cartman,"[makes his way to Kyle] Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!"
54,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't want you to jump them, retard!"
55,11,7,Bum 1,Spare some change?
56,11,7,Randy Marsh,"No, sorry, I don't have any change."
57,11,7,Bum 2,[a few stores down] Got any change?
58,11,7,Randy Marsh,"No, sorry. [the bum follows him until he passes the third bum]"
59,11,7,Bum 3,Can you spare some change? [Randy looks back and runs into the fourth bum]
60,11,7,Bum 4,[holds out his cup] Chaaange?
61,11,7,Randy Marsh,Huh! I don't have any change. [more bums come out of the woodwork and crowd in on him]
62,11,7,Bum 5,[an elderly woman] Change?
63,11,7,Randy Marsh,No!
64,11,7,Bum 6,"Change? [Randy runs across the street, but...]"
65,11,7,Bum 7,Spare some change?
66,11,7,Randy Marsh,[shielding himself with his suitcase] Leave me alone I don't have any change!
67,11,7,Bum 7,"All right, God bless you, sir."
68,11,7,Randy Marsh,"Oh, now I feel bad. [goes back to the bum] Here! [tosses some change into the cup] Ahh! [the other bums reach the other side of the street] Hahh! [begins to run, but other homeless people appear, asking for change. Randy moves past them] Nono, that was really all the change I had."
69,11,7,Bum 7,[jumps into view again] Spare some change?
70,11,7,Randy Marsh,I just gave you change!
71,11,7,Bum 8,"[another old woman] Change? [the homeless crowd Randy in and he can't escape. Their pleading takes on a chanting quality: ""Change? Change? Change? Spare some change? God bless. ...""]"
72,11,7,Randy Marsh,Wahhh! I don't have any more change! [makes his way through the crown of bums] Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! [disappears under the sea of homeless people]
73,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend."
74,11,7,Randy Marsh,"[outside] Waaah! [bangs on the doors] Awwww! [enters, shuts the door behind him, and locks it] Stay away! [implores and pounds on the door] Stay awayhay!"
75,11,7,Jimbo Kern,"Randy? Randy, what happened?"
76,11,7,Randy Marsh,Stay awa- ...I don't have any change! [collapses on the floor against the door] I don't have any chaaaahahange!
77,11,7,Announcer,"This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs."
78,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"South Park has become overrun with the homeless. [a shot of the homeless crowd in front of South Park Elementary, then another shot of them in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty] Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible. [a portrait of a homeless woman] Many people are trapped throughout the town. [an aerial shot of the community center. The center is surrounded by homeless people, with the five adults inside it now on the roof]"
79,11,7,Randy Marsh,Help! Help us!
80,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's our dads."
81,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God.
82,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change."
83,11,7,Bum 9,[appears behind him in the newsroom] Spare some change?
84,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,What the? You can't be in here.
85,11,7,Bum 9,"Ya got any change, sir?"
86,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?
87,11,7,Bum 1,Chaaaaange?
88,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any- [a PLEASE STAND BY screen pops up and the station goes off the air]"
89,11,7,Eric Cartman,"You see what you did, Kyle?!"
90,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. [the boys turn off the TV and head outside]"
91,11,7,Eric Cartman,They're everywhere!
92,11,7,Mayor's Aide,[pulls up in his car] What are you boys doing? Get in.
93,11,7,Bum 11,"[knocks on his window] Spare any change, sir?"
94,11,7,Mayor's Aide,"[throws up his arms and shakes his head vigorously] Ahhhh! [settles down and starts driving] Come on, let's go! [some distance down the street] What the hell were you doing outside?!"
95,11,7,Stan Marsh,Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
96,11,7,Mayor's Aide,You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... things. [a bum lands on the windshield]
97,11,7,The Boys,Ahh! [the bum begins to wash the windshield]
98,11,7,Mayor's Aide,"No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit! [peels off at the first opportunity] Look, our only hope is to talk to the homeless researcher out on Travis Street. He understands what's goin' on better than anybody. Just stick with me, kids. [enters an intersection, but doesn't notice the driver to his left, who's not paying attention to the road. They collide, with the aide dying on the spot]"
99,11,7,The Boys,"[exit the car uninjured] Aaahhh! [they move along the street, but notice the homeless everywhere. Another collision takes place a block away from them]"
100,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Holy shit, dude! [behind him, the other three boys move a manhole cover off to one side, opening up a new means of escape]"
101,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Over here! [Kyle looks back. Cartman and Kenny drop down into the sewer and Kyle walks to the manhole.] Jump down! Go! [Kyle drops down, and finally, Stan]"
102,11,7,Eric Cartman,"[pinching his nose shut with his left hand as he fans the smell away with his right] Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here."
103,11,7,Kenny McCormick,"[punches Cartman angrily] (Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)"
104,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together."
105,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. [they move forward.]"
106,11,7,Randy Marsh,[lowers his binoculars] No sign of anybody else.
107,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,[rising from his chair] That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
108,11,7,Randy Marsh,"[turns around to face him] Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people."
109,11,7,Stephen Stotch,"And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere."
110,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try."
111,11,7,Randy Marsh,"You won't make it through, Gerald! [Gerald leaves quickly and heads downstairs. He leaves the community center, only to be hounded by bums begging for change]"
112,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,[making his way through] Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.
113,11,7,Bums,Change? Change sir? You got some change?
114,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here. [reaches into his left pocket and tosses some change off to his left]  There! There's some change. All right, a little bit. [reaches into his right pocket and tosses some change off to his right] There you go. Take the change. [leaves, but stops himself] Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?"
115,11,7,Bum 12,"Change, sir?"
116,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change? [Randy follows Gerald through his binoculars] Change. Change? [Randy lowers his binoculars in horror]"
117,11,7,Stephen Stotch,What happened?
118,11,7,Randy Marsh,[closes his eyes] He's become one of them.
119,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Go away, I I don't have any change."
120,11,7,Stan Marsh,Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
121,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Yes. Who are you?
122,11,7,Stan Marsh,We think this may be our friend's fault. [shows Kyle] He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
123,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on? [the boys enter and he shuts the door]
124,11,7,Stan Marsh,There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
125,11,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof."
126,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Jump them?
127,11,7,Eric Cartman,"I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people."
128,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy."
129,11,7,Eric Cartman,I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
130,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You barely made it over one, fatass!"
131,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!"
132,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
133,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory. [lightning and thunderclaps follow]
134,11,7,Randy Marsh,We don't have any change! Go away!
135,11,7,Linda Stotch,"Anything, Stephen?"
136,11,7,Stephen Stotch,No. All the phone lines are completely down. [the stairwell door behind them rattles and they turn to face it in fear. Randy steps toward it with his shotgun and cocks it. More knocking on the door]
137,11,7,A Man,[inside the stairwell] Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.
138,11,7,Randy Marsh,"Find another place to hide, Steve!"
139,11,7,Steve Garrett,I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
140,11,7,Stephen Stotch,We can't just leave them out there.
141,11,7,Steve Garrett,"Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change."
142,11,7,Linda Stotch,"You have to let them in, Randy."
143,11,7,Randy Marsh,There isn't enough food for more people up here!
144,11,7,Steve Garrett,Oh God. One of them is a war veteran. [more knocking] We're gonna have to give him some change.
145,11,7,Stephen Stotch,This isn't happening!
146,11,7,Randy Marsh,"All right all right, fine! [approaches slowly and opens the door. The refugees stream forth]"
147,11,7,Bum 13,"Could you spare some change, sir?"
148,11,7,Randy Marsh,[shuts the door quickly] Harrrh!
149,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one. [a homeless man is chained to a wall by a chain around his neck. The advisor approaches him] The homeless... can survive solely... on change. [pulls out some change]"
150,11,7,Bum 14,[sticks out his cup and strains to get the money] Change?
151,11,7,Homeless Advisor,They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving
152,11,7,Bum 14,Is that... is that some spare change?
153,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance."
154,11,7,Bum 14,"Spare some of that change, sir?"
155,11,7,Homeless Advisor,But now watch. [drops some coins into the bum's cup and walks back to the boys. The bum rattles his cup a bit]
156,11,7,Bum 14,Spare some change?
157,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here. [heads to his left and the boys follow] This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days."
158,11,7,Bum 15,Chaaaaange?
159,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,What's it doing?
160,11,7,Homeless Advisor,It's dying.
161,11,7,Eric Cartman,Cool.
162,11,7,Homeless Advisor,I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.
163,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"[finds the advisor's office and enters] Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? [other homeless men follow him in]"
164,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Oh my God, they're coming in! [leads the boys to an escape hatch above some crates] Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!"
165,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,[helps Cartman up] What about you?
166,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
167,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny."
168,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Hello? [comes down a spiral staircase] I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?"
169,11,7,Bum 16,Change?
170,11,7,Bum 17,Spare some change?
171,11,7,Bum 18,Change?
172,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,Stop it! I really do need change!
173,11,7,Bum 16,Me too. Change?
174,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,[outside the lab] Change? [knocks on the lab door] Hello? Do you have any change?
175,11,7,Bum,[outside the lab] Chaaange?
176,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Sorry to take the easy way out. [takes a gun to his right temple and cocks it. An exterior view of his office is shown and a gunshot heard. Back inside, he's still standing, in pain. The bullet went out the left temple, but didn't kill him.] OW! OH, FUCK! OWW! [next he tries shooting through his jaw, and the bullet comes out through his right cheek.] OHHH! AH! GOD! [shoots through his jaw again, and the bullet goes out his right cheek again. This time he gargles and drops on all fours. He shoots through his right shoulder three times, but still lives. This time he takes the gun to his forehead and cocks the gun. The exterior view of his office is shown again and a gunshot is heard. Back inside, he's still alive. The bullet to the brain didn't kill him. This time he shoots at his heart twice, and that finally kills him. He writhes around for a few seconds and dies.]"
177,11,7,Randy Marsh,"[rifling through a box] No. No, damn it! [faces the small group on the roof with him] That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts."
178,11,7,Jimbo Kern,No. We can't be.
179,11,7,Randy Marsh,"Face it, we're gonna starve!"
180,11,7,Linda Stotch,"No, no wait, there's still a box over here."
181,11,7,Randy Marsh,Those are cherry! Ich!
182,11,7,Head of Public Safety,"[his cell phone rings and he rises] Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal. [dials a number]"
183,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,What? You do?
184,11,7,Randy Marsh,How? Call the fire department.
185,11,7,Head of Public Safety,"I'm calling my wife! [waits for her to pick up] Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?"
186,11,7,Linda Stotch,"Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay."
187,11,7,Stephen Stotch,Ask her what's happening.
188,11,7,Head of Public Safety,"Mary, what's goin' on out there? Nobody's coming for us. They what? No! That's impossible. But how can that be? We didn't even- [the phone cuts out] Hello? Mary. [tries to reconnect] Mary!"
189,11,7,Jimbo Kern,"What happened, Glen?"
190,11,7,Glen,"[Head of Public Safety] There's no help coming! She said... because of all the homeless... because of all the homeless in South Park property values have plummeted. I had two liens against my house and so the bank is foreclosing! I don't have a home anymore. [Randy and the others are quiet for a moment, but Randy knows what he must do. He pumps his shotgun and aims at Glen.]"
191,11,7,Linda Stotch,"Randy, what are you doing?"
192,11,7,Randy Marsh,He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
193,11,7,Glen,I'm not like them.
194,11,7,Randy Marsh,Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
195,11,7,Linda Stotch,"[tries dissuading Randy] And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?"
196,11,7,Randy Marsh,If we have to! Siddown Glen!
197,11,7,Glen,"Randy, you can't just-"
198,11,7,Randy Marsh,SIT... doowwwnnnn!
199,11,7,Glen,This is crazy. How can they just take away my house? Where am I supposed to put all my things? I don't have a place for all my stuff; where am I supposed to put all my stuff? I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow some- money to put my stuff in storage? Come on guys. If you all just help me out a little bit. Each one of you just put in a little... change? Change? [That's it. Randy fires at him and blows the upper half of his head off. Randy sighs heavily]
200,11,7,Stan Marsh,What the hell happened here? [three men in camouflage appear and aim their shotguns at them]
201,11,7,Man 1,[wearing a white and blue bandana around his neck] That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
202,11,7,Stan Marsh,"We, just came to ask a question."
203,11,7,Man 2,You homeless or homeowners?
204,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,We're nine.
205,11,7,Man 1,"Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!"
206,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem."
207,11,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
208,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, Cartman!"
209,11,7,Man 1,Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
210,11,7,Eric Cartman,Youu heard about that?
211,11,7,Man 2,Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
212,11,7,Eric Cartman,Thirty was hard enough.
213,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!"
214,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!"
215,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town."
216,11,7,Man 2,"Well, that was easy. [the group moves to a clearing where the boys sit on a bench while the first man serves himself some coffee and begins explaining]"
217,11,7,Man 1,"The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know! [sips] Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War! [Kyle notices something on the ground] That's when I started suspecting that [the something is a pamphlet that says ""HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS"" on the front cover. He picks it up] my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept. [Kyle reads the pamphlet] After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. [Kyle opens the pamphlet and is met with these words: ""HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS. TRY SOUTH PARK.""]"
218,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You son of a bitch. [gets off the bench and approaches the first man with the pamphlet] You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! [opens the pamphlet to show him]"
219,11,7,Man 1,"That's right, yes."
220,11,7,Stan Marsh,What?
221,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
222,11,7,Man 1,And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
223,11,7,Stan Marsh,"[getting off the bench] But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!"
224,11,7,Man 1,Right. But we survived.
225,11,7,A Woman,"[pops up out of nowhere, almost a skeleton] Dehhhnyihhhs! [she's armed with a rifle and ready to shoot]"

228,11,7,Dennis from Evergreen,"I had to, Christine, you were homeless."
229,11,7,Christine from Evergreen,"No, I wasn't honeless yeh stukid asshole!"

233,11,7,Christine from Evergreen,No! You durned my yits oth!
234,11,7,Dennis from Evergreen,"I have no idea what you're saying! [Christine shoots him] Ow! [Dennis is dead. The third man kills Christine, who fires one final shot and hits the second man. The second man kills the third and dies moments later]"
235,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!"
236,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around] No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea."
237,11,7,Stan Marsh,"No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!"
238,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
239,11,7,Kenny McCormick,(What are you gonna do?)
240,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
241,11,7,Randy Marsh,A bus! A bus is coming!
242,11,7,Jimbo Kern,[seeing who's inside] It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
243,11,7,Stephen Stotch,I knew they'd come back for us!
244,11,7,Linda Stotch,All right!
245,11,7,A Woman,Yeah.
246,11,7,Randy Marsh,"[props up Glen's corpse so it faces the bus] Look, Glen. We're saved. [the bus stops]"
247,11,7,Stan Marsh,"All right, I'm turning around"
248,11,7,Stephen Stotch,Why are they turning?
249,11,7,Randy Marsh,[drops the corpse] What are they doing? [the bus turns so the front end now faces away from the community center. Randy calls out] Don't leave us!
250,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, hit it."
