0,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice."
1,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Hiya, Sparky."
2,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,[Looking] Who's that?
3,1,4,Stan Marsh,That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
4,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! Cool!
5,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?"
6,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Eh. You're making me sick, dude."
7,1,4,Stan Marsh,He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
8,1,4,Eric Cartman,No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
9,1,4,Sylvester,Arrrrrr.
10,1,4,Stan Marsh,He's not meaner than Sparky.
11,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!"
12,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky'll kick his ass.
13,1,4,Eric Cartman,I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
14,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You're on, dude!"
15,1,4,Stan Marsh,"That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!"
16,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass."
17,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky! Bad dog!
18,1,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)"
19,1,4,Stan Marsh,What?!
20,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay."
21,1,4,Stan Marsh,What do you mean?
22,1,4,Eric Cartman,That dog is a gay homosexual.
23,1,4,Stan Marsh,He's just confused.
24,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
25,1,4,Kenny McCormick,"(No, check his penis.)"
26,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Sick, shut up dude!"
27,1,4,Eric Cartman,Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.
28,1,4,Chef,"Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park."
29,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Who's Middle Park?
30,1,4,Eric Cartman,What's homecoming?
31,1,4,Chef,"But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. [silence] Now, let's start practice."
32,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?"
33,1,4,Chef,"Yes Pip, what is it?"
34,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Well, I still don't have a helmet."
35,1,4,Chef,"I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody."
36,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?"
37,1,4,Chef,"Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does."
38,1,4,Pip Pirrip,Oh.
39,1,4,Chef,"Sorry son, now get your ass in there."
40,1,4,Stan Marsh,Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
41,1,4,Chef,[impatiently] Hike the damn ball!
42,1,4,Pip Pirrip,Aaaaaaaargh!
43,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?"
44,1,4,Chef,"[distracted] Huh? Oh, fine, fine."
45,1,4,Jimbo Kern,I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.
46,1,4,Chef,Elementary school alumni?
47,1,4,Jimbo Kern,That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
48,1,4,Chef,I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
49,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Middle Park by 70 points.
50,1,4,Chef,Hmmm...
51,1,4,Chef,I don't think we have a chance.
52,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. [yells] Right Stanley?
53,1,4,Stan Marsh,Huh?
54,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Atta boy!
55,1,4,Chef,"Great pass, Stan."
56,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!"
57,1,4,Chef,Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
58,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?"
59,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart."
60,1,4,Clyde Donovan,"Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time."
61,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down!"
62,1,4,Clyde Donovan,Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!
63,1,4,Eric Cartman,There he goes again.
64,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Get down, Sparky! Down!"
65,1,4,Eric Cartman,Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
66,1,4,Clyde Donovan,Make him stop!
67,1,4,Rex,Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!
68,1,4,Fosse McDonald,I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.
69,1,4,Bill Allen,"Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan."
70,1,4,Fosse McDonald,Gay dog.
71,1,4,Eric Cartman,"...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television."
72,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-."
73,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Ah, dammit!"
74,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?"
75,1,4,Mr Hat,"Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?"
76,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next."
77,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Um, I'm not really prepared either."
78,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Well, just make something up, like Eric did."
79,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-"
80,1,4,Mr Garrison,Excellent. A-.
81,1,4,Eric Cartman,Eeyy!
82,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Wow, cool!"
83,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?"
84,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people."
85,1,4,Eric Cartman,That's not fair!
86,1,4,Mr Hat,"Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it."
87,1,4,Eric Cartman,Stupid puppet.
88,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan."
89,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?"
90,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Well of course Stanley, what is it?"
91,1,4,Stan Marsh,What's a... homosexual?
92,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down."
93,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?"
94,1,4,Stan Marsh,I guess.
95,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual."
96,1,4,Eric Cartman,You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
97,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
98,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog."
99,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, dude!"
100,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?"
101,1,4,Sparky,"Bark, bark."
102,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen."
103,1,4,Stan Marsh,"He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky."
104,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Good boy, now shake."
105,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Good boy. Now, don't be gay."
106,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay."
107,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Did it work?
108,1,4,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
109,1,4,Eric Cartman,He still looks pretty gay to me.
110,1,4,Bill Allen,"Huh, huh."
111,1,4,Fosse McDonald,"Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?"
112,1,4,Bill Allen,"Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbara Streisand concert. [they laugh] Stupid little gay dog."
113,1,4,Fosse McDonald,Gay dog.
114,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Come on you guys, I have an idea."
115,1,4,Jimbo Kern,I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
116,1,4,Bookie,Are you crazy?
117,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread."
118,1,4,Gambler 1,I want to put all my money on the Cows.
119,1,4,Gambler 2,"Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it."
120,1,4,Gambler 3,"Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too."
121,1,4,Female Gambler 1,I got 500 on the Cows.
122,1,4,Female Gambler 2,"Well, I'll put my money on the Cows."
123,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now..."
124,1,4,Gambler 4,"You better be right about this, Jimbo."
125,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself."
126,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Are you sure Stan is that good?
127,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?"
128,1,4,Bookie,You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.
129,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,I love that song.
130,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget."
131,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-"
132,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!"
133,1,4,Stan Marsh,"No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi."
134,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Ooh-la-la.
135,1,4,Eric Cartman,There he goes!
136,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Atta boy, Spark! Get her!"
137,1,4,Stan Marsh,Yes!
138,1,4,Stan Marsh,Ah crap! Now what do I do?
139,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
140,1,4,Eric Cartman,"No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France."
141,1,4,Kenny McCormick,(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
142,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil."
143,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else."
144,1,4,Stan Marsh,Like who?
145,1,4,TV Announcer,And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.
146,1,4,Jesus Christ,"Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]"
147,1,4,Robert,"Yeah, is, is this Jesus?"
148,1,4,Jesus Christ,Yes my son.
149,1,4,Robert,"This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife."
150,1,4,Jesus Christ,Of course Robert. How are things now?
151,1,4,Robert,"Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins, that was really nice of you."
152,1,4,Jesus Christ,"Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]"
153,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual."
154,1,4,Jesus Christ,"My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-"
155,1,4,TV Announcer,"That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews."
156,1,4,Stan Marsh,Damn it!
157,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,What'd he say?
158,1,4,Stan Marsh,I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
159,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!"
160,1,4,Stan Marsh,Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
161,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on dude, we have to get to practice."
162,1,4,Stan Marsh,"No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!"
163,1,4,Stan Marsh,I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
164,1,4,Chef,"Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. [Music starts.] Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! [Sinks into the mood.]

Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm."
165,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Chef?"
166,1,4,Chef,"Spank it, ever so gently."
167,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Chef.
168,1,4,Chef,Spank it.
169,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Chef!
170,1,4,Chef,"Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays."
171,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Uh, Mr. Chef sir?"
172,1,4,Chef,"No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you."
173,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?"
174,1,4,Chef,"That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?"
175,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"No um, I guess not."
176,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime."
177,1,4,Carl,What moment would that be?
178,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F."
179,1,4,Carl,What high F?
180,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"You know, 
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah."
181,1,4,Carl,"Right, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?"
182,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"No, dammit! The aaaaah!"
183,1,4,Carl,Aaaaahh?
184,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Aaaaahh.
185,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Aaaaahh!
186,1,4,Carl,Aaaaahh.
187,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Great.
188,1,4,Carl,Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah.
189,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Doo-nn-doo-doo
190,1,4,Jimbo Kern,You got it.
191,1,4,Carl,Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...
192,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Aaa - dooo...
193,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Aaaaahh!
194,1,4,Carl,"Alright, yeah, okay..."
195,1,4,Chef,"What's the matter Stan, you seem down."
196,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay."
197,1,4,Chef,"Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks."
198,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda."
199,1,4,Chef,Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
200,1,4,Mr Garrison,What do you mean?
201,1,4,Chef,"Well, you're gay aren't you?"
202,1,4,Mr Garrison,What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
203,1,4,Chef,"Well, you sure do act like it."
204,1,4,Mr Garrison,"I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass."
205,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,What's the matter dude?
206,1,4,Stan Marsh,I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
207,1,4,Eric Cartman,Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!
208,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al."
209,1,4,Big Gay Al,Have you been outcast?
210,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?"
211,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here."
212,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back."
213,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, it's been like two days."
214,1,4,Stan Marsh,I think he might've run away.
215,1,4,Eric Cartman,Did you check the shopping ma- [Stan punches him] Ow!
216,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan."
217,1,4,Stan Marsh,I'm not playing.
218,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,You what?!
219,1,4,Stan Marsh,I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. [leaves]
220,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"[whispering] Come on Ned, and keep quiet."
221,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,[louder] Okay.
222,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hello there, Enrique."
223,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,What are we doing here?
224,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead."
225,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in ""Loving You"", Boom!"
226,1,4,Jimbo Kern,No more Middle Park players.
227,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"God damn, I love football!"
228,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
229,1,4,Cowboys,Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!
230,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows."
231,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up."
232,1,4,Chef,"[between his teeth] Oohh, come on, Stan..."
233,1,4,Pip Pirrip,"Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?"
234,1,4,Chef,"No Pip, I'm sorry!"
235,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky! Sparky!
236,1,4,Referee,Play ball.
237,1,4,Chef,"You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle."
238,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,But I never practiced quarterback.
239,1,4,Chef,Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.
240,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski."
241,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Hey hey, where is little Stanley?"
242,1,4,Mr Hat,"Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?"
243,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Ned, look!"
244,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached."
245,1,4,Ned Gerblansky,Yay.
246,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Hi little fella, how are you doing today?"
247,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Fine, how are you?"
248,1,4,Big Gay Al,"I'm super, thanks for asking."
249,1,4,Stan Marsh,My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
250,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Well, let's see. Come on in. [they enter]"
251,1,4,Stan Marsh,Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
252,1,4,Big Gay Al,We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
253,1,4,Gay Lion,Rooaar.
254,1,4,Big Gay Al,"And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!"
255,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy."
256,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?"
257,1,4,Vocalist,"Oww, we can both be gay!"
258,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!"
259,1,4,Huddle,Break!
260,1,4,Cowboy 1,You guys are toast.
261,1,4,Cowboy 2,"Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in."
262,1,4,Eric Cartman,We'll just see about that.
263,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Set, set."
264,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it Cartman!
265,1,4,Chef,What's the matter?
266,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman farted!
267,1,4,Eric Cartman,No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
268,1,4,Chef,Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
269,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,No way dude!
270,1,4,Chef,Hike! The! Ball!
271,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, dude, weak."
272,1,4,Eric Cartman,"That's right, you get back there."
273,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hike!
274,1,4,Frank Hammond,Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!
275,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter."
276,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Hell's bells.
277,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King."
278,1,4,Phil,"Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again."
279,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that."
280,1,4,Townsman 1,"We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo."
281,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh."
282,1,4,Vocalist,...both be gay.
283,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?"
284,1,4,Sparky,Ruff.
285,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared."
286,1,4,Sparky,Barr.
287,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game."
288,1,4,Stan Marsh,We can work on making you not gay together.
289,1,4,Stan Marsh,Sparky?
290,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Young man, it appears you still don't understand."
291,1,4,Stan Marsh,What don't I understand?
292,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Come this way, I have to show you something."
293,1,4,Frank Hammond,"With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0."
294,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hut, hut."
295,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant."
296,1,4,Phil,Dude! Now that is not cool.
297,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Sorry, sorry."
298,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride."
299,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Step aboard, Stanley."
300,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time."
301,1,4,Frank Hammond,And the South Park Cows are set to receive...
302,1,4,Frank Hammond,"There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick."
303,1,4,Frank Hammond,"He's at the 50, the 40, the 30."
304,1,4,Cowboys,"Hold him, hold him!"
305,1,4,Cowboys,"Hold him, hold him!"
306,1,4,Cowboy,Yaaah!
307,1,4,Frank Hammond,The little running back is down. I think he's...
308,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Yes, he's been decapitated."
309,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!"
310,1,4,Phil,"Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank."
311,1,4,Frank Hammond,Ouch-a-roo!
312,1,4,Chef,"Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!"
313,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot."
314,1,4,Big Gay Al,"You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan."
315,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!"
316,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely."
317,1,4,Boat Ride Singers,"We're all gay, and it's okay,
'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.
We're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.
It's okay, hey, to be gay!"
318,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Sooo, what do you think, Stan?"
319,1,4,Stan Marsh,"This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand."
320,1,4,Big Gay Al,[to himself] Isn't this precious?
321,1,4,Frank Hammond,"And now, here to sing the touching song Loving You, is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother..."

327,1,4,Jimbo Kern,He didn't sing the high F!
328,1,4,Mr Garrison,"Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this."
329,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.
330,1,4,Richard Stamos,Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...

332,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!"
333,1,4,Sparky,Ruff!
334,1,4,Big Gay Al,"No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?"
335,1,4,Stan Marsh,"No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!"
336,1,4,Big Gay Al,Oh Stan?
337,1,4,Big Gay Al,"When you get back to town, [earnest music plays] tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately."
338,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I will Big Gay Al, I will."
339,1,4,Big Gay Al,"Ooh, my carrot cake! [rushes inside]"
340,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hike!
341,1,4,Frank Hammond,And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...
342,1,4,Mr Garrison,"I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo."
343,1,4,Mr Hat,"Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game."
344,1,4,Townsman,"You're a dead man, Jimbo!"
345,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Well, this should just about wrap it up for-"
346,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Wait a minute, what's this?"
347,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Yeah! Yohooooh!

349,1,4,Chef,Where the hell have you been Stan?!
350,1,4,Stan Marsh,I've been getting my best friend back.
351,1,4,Chef,Just get in there boy!
352,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Give 'em hell, Stanley!"
353,1,4,Jimbo Kern,"Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?"
354,1,4,Jesus Christ,Leave me alone.
355,1,4,Stan Marsh,Hike!
356,1,4,Frank Hammond,Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
357,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!"
358,1,4,Stan Marsh,Mph!
359,1,4,Frank Hammond,"And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!"
360,1,4,Kyle Broflovski,Oof.
361,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!"
362,1,4,Phil,Dude!
363,1,4,Frank Hammond,Touchdown!
364,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Yeah! Wooo!
365,1,4,Frank Hammond,"The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!"
366,1,4,Jimbo Kern,Yeah! Woohoo!
367,1,4,Townsman,Speech!
368,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?"
369,1,4,Stan Marsh,Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
370,1,4,Crowd,"Yeah, alright!"
371,1,4,Stan Marsh,And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
372,1,4,Crowd,Wooooh!
373,1,4,Stan Marsh,And it's okay to be gay!
374,1,4,Jimbo Kern,What?!
375,1,4,Stan Marsh,"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing."
376,1,4,Mr Garrison,What the hell is he talking about?
377,1,4,Frank Hammond,"Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?"
378,1,4,Stan Marsh,"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety."
379,1,4,Stan Marsh,"It's true, I'll show you."
380,1,4,Stan Marsh,But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
381,1,4,Eric Cartman,"Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man."
