50,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?"
51,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage."
52,1,7,Eric Cartman,"I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!"

74,1,7,Stan Marsh,Wendy?
75,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, Stan."

77,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Yeahhh?
78,1,7,Stan Marsh,We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
79,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look."
80,1,7,Stan Marsh,You what?!
81,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca."

87,1,7,Eric Cartman,"There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?"
88,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!"
89,1,7,Eric Cartman,You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
90,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Wookies don't live on Endor!
91,1,7,Eric Cartman,[In a mocking voice.] Wookies don't live on Endor.
92,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
93,1,7,Eric Cartman,What?! What did you say?
94,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel-"
95,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Eww.
96,1,7,Mr Garrison,Is there a problem Kenny?
97,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?"
98,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
99,1,7,Liane,"Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things..."
100,1,7,Liane,Hello there!

106,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
107,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? [As Kenny.] No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like. [As himself.] Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you."
108,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Aren't you hungry Kenny?
109,1,7,Stan Marsh,"He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything."
110,1,7,Chef,Hello children.
111,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Chef.
112,1,7,Stan Marsh,Hey Chef.
113,1,7,Chef,What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!

115,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef."
116,1,7,Chef,Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
117,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?"
118,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!"
119,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!"
120,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself."
121,1,7,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool."
122,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Where did you get that costume, young man?!"
123,1,7,Eric Cartman,"My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!"
124,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Sshh! Oh, God bless America."
125,1,7,Principal Victoria,You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
126,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o."
127,1,7,Clyde Donovan,"Owww, you bit my arm!"
128,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[Pleased.] Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal."
129,1,7,Principal Victoria,Watch the video Eric.
130,1,7,Narrator,"Adolph Hitler was a very, very naughty man."
131,1,7,Adolf Hitler,Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brüder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa-
132,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!"
133,1,7,Puffy the Bear,"So remember kids, dressing like Hitler in school isn't cool!"
134,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Now, do you have any questions?"
135,1,7,Eric Cartman,[Gleefully.] Could I see that again? That was cool.
136,1,7,Principal Victoria,"You must remove that costume, immediately!"
137,1,7,Eric Cartman,"I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy."
138,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now."
139,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?"
140,1,7,Eric Cartman,[Whining.] I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
141,1,7,Principal Victoria,"Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man."
142,1,7,Jogger,"Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around."
143,1,7,Eric Cartman,Boo! I'm a ghost.
144,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh man, I feel like a total choad."
145,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad."
146,1,7,Chef,"Hello, children."
147,1,7,Eric Cartman,Hey Chef.
148,1,7,Chef,Aaaaah!
149,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?"

155,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes."
156,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers."
157,1,7,Eric Cartman,Who?
158,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I thought she was dead."
159,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, me too."
160,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume."
161,1,7,Mr Garrison,"...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!"
162,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!"
163,1,7,Mr Garrison,"And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children. [Everyone laughs.] Yeah."
164,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!"
165,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
166,1,7,Stan Marsh,I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
167,1,7,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe."
168,1,7,Mr Garrison,"That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing."
169,1,7,Clyde Donovan,Brainnns. Ahh.
170,1,7,Mr Garrison,Wait your turn Clyde.
171,1,7,Johnson,Uuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!

173,1,7,Johnson,Piiink eyyye.
174,1,7,Chef,Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye!
175,1,7,Tom,"...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, ""Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station."""
176,1,7,Tom,"In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini."
177,1,7,Midget wearing a Bikini,"Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus."
178,1,7,Midget wearing a Bikini,"Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes."
179,1,7,Chef,Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
180,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him."
181,1,7,Stan Marsh,I bet I get more candy than you dude.
182,1,7,Eric Cartman,Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
183,1,7,Stan Marsh,"No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference."
184,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking."
185,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!"
186,1,7,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!"
187,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey dudes.
188,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight..."
189,1,7,Eric Cartman,Check.

192,1,7,Stan Marsh,Taser...
193,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,What's that?
194,1,7,Stan Marsh,"For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something."
195,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, granola pisses me off."
196,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Kenny.
197,1,7,Stan Marsh,Hey Kenny.
198,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny."
199,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,You still didn't get a costume Kenny?
200,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire."
201,1,7,Eric Cartman,"I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!"
202,1,7,Eric Cartman,"I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate."
203,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Hi guys.
204,1,7,Eric Cartman,Hi Wendy.
205,1,7,Stan Marsh,[Pointedly.] How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
206,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi."
207,1,7,Eric Cartman,You what?! Are you insane?!
208,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Let's go trick-or-treats.
209,1,7,Stan Marsh,"I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day."
210,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad."
211,1,7,Eric Cartman,How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
212,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!"
213,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,But Stan!
214,1,7,Stan Marsh,"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!"
215,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,AAAAAAAAAAAH!
216,1,7,Chef,Doctor!
217,1,7,Doctor,"Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?"
218,1,7,Chef,"No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead."
219,1,7,Doctor,What the hell are you talking about?
220,1,7,Chef,"Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!"
221,1,7,Doctor,"Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream."
222,1,7,Chef,"Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!"
223,1,7,Mr Torres,Aaah!
224,1,7,Doctor,"Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef."
225,1,7,Chef,"Oh, sorry."
226,1,7,Chef,"But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here."
227,1,7,Doctor,"Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years."
228,1,7,Chef,"Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?"
229,1,7,Doctor,"Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah."
230,1,7,Chef,Aaaaaaaaaah!
231,1,7,Doctor,"Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody."
232,1,7,Doctor,Ahh!
233,1,7,The Boys,Trick-or-treat!
234,1,7,Elderly Woman,"Ohh, how cute."
235,1,7,Elderly Woman,Aaah!
236,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Kenny!"
237,1,7,Elderly Woman,"Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911!"
238,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy."
239,1,7,Elderly Woman,Call 911!
240,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops."
241,1,7,Eric Cartman,"You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!"
242,1,7,Chef,"Mayor, we've got a big problem."
243,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,Ugh!
244,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Why, why Chef. What a surprise!"
245,1,7,Officer Barbrady,You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
246,1,7,Chef,"Actually, uh-"
247,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia."
248,1,7,Officer Barbrady,[Wagging his finger.] Not a thingy-dingy.
249,1,7,Chef,I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
250,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,"You mean, Tina Yothers?"
251,1,7,Chef,"No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!"
252,1,7,Officer Barbrady,"Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?"
253,1,7,Chef,"[Pissed.] Aw, the hell with you both!"
254,1,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, let's get back to it."
255,1,7,Officer Barbrady,Righty-o.
256,1,7,The Boys,Trick-or-treat.

259,1,7,Dude,Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah!
260,1,7,Eric Cartman,Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
261,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!"
262,1,7,Somebody,"Oh, God!"
263,1,7,The Boys,Trick-or-treat.

273,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Chef! No!
274,1,7,Chef,"[Suddenly calm.] Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them."
275,1,7,Eric Cartman,Can we have some candy now please?!
276,1,7,Chef,"Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!"
277,1,7,Eric Cartman,I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
278,1,7,Chef,"Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!"
279,1,7,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about Chef?
280,1,7,Chef,Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
281,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains."
282,1,7,Chef,"Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town."
283,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, that means..."
284,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,If everyone is turned into zombies...
285,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!"
286,1,7,Eric Cartman,Aaah!
287,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, you've gotta help us!"
288,1,7,Chef,I'm working on it children.
289,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Wait, where are we going?"
290,1,7,Chef,"The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue."
291,1,7,Eric Cartman,It was Kyle.
292,1,7,Stan Marsh,I don't know about this Chef.
293,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I'm scared."
294,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Remember candy, focus on the candy."
295,1,7,Stan Marsh,What are we doing here Chef?
296,1,7,Chef,Just look for anything suspicious.
297,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,I found it! I found it!

299,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"See Cartman, your mom is on the cover."

331,1,7,Stan Marsh,"I know, but uh-... but..."
332,1,7,Eric Cartman,Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
333,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, yeah!"
334,1,7,Hotline Voice,"For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!"
335,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, okay. Then what?"
336,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Aaahh.
337,1,7,Stan Marsh,"[Apologetically.] Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it."
338,1,7,Eric Cartman,Kill her Stan!
339,1,7,Hotline Voice,"All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal."

349,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,It's working! They're turning back to normal.
350,1,7,Chef,You did it children!
351,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!"
352,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
353,1,7,Stan Marsh,"That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead."
354,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.
355,1,7,Wendy Testaburger,"Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!"
356,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh man, I can't believe he's gone."
357,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us."
358,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw."
359,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way."
360,1,7,Stan Marsh,"You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving."
361,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"...No, dude, that's Christmas."
362,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Oh, then, what's Halloween about?"
363,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,Costumes and candy.
364,1,7,Stan Marsh,Oh.
365,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, let's go home, start eating that candy."
366,1,7,Kyle Broflovski,"We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom."
367,1,7,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
368,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money."
369,1,7,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month."
370,1,7,Eric Cartman,"Lehh, eh, screw you guys!"
