0,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school."
1,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
2,1,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.)"
3,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
4,1,13,Stan Marsh,Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
5,1,13,Ms Crabtree,"Come on, we're running late!"
6,1,13,Stan Marsh,"We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!"
7,1,13,Ms Crabtree,What did you say?!
8,1,13,Stan Marsh,"I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch."
9,1,13,Ms Crabtree,"Oh. Alright, then."
10,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude."
11,1,13,Stan Marsh,I always wondered if that would work.
12,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Hello, boys."
13,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass Mitt to mouth.] I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school."
14,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard."
15,1,13,Stan Marsh,In the backyard?
16,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?"
17,1,13,Polly,"Yes, Eric, I would like some tea. Thank you."
18,1,13,Eric Cartman,"You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants."
19,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?"
20,1,13,Clyde,"Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?"
21,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am."
22,1,13,Polly,"You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody likes you."
23,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. [Sips.]"
24,1,13,Stan Marsh,"[Behind the bushes with the others.] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here."
25,1,13,Kenny McCormick,"(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.)"
26,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
27,1,13,Stan Marsh,"No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help."
28,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
29,1,13,Peter,"[Back at table.] We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea."
30,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey."
31,1,13,Polly,Eric is the best!
32,1,13,Clyde,Hooray for Eric!
33,1,13,Peter,Eric kicks ass!
34,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman."
35,1,13,Mr Mackey,"Oh, well, there's a news flash!"
36,1,13,Stan Marsh,Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
37,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
38,1,13,Mr Mackey,"Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay?"
39,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Woo-whataya mean?
40,1,13,Mr Mackey,Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
41,1,13,Stan Marsh,No.
42,1,13,Mr Mackey,"Well-obviously something is bothering him. [looks left] Oh, of course!"
43,1,13,Mr Mackey,"My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay?"
44,1,13,Stan Marsh,Is that legal?
45,1,13,Mr Mackey,"Oh, hell yes!"
46,1,13,Eric Cartman,"My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants."
47,1,13,Polly,"Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true."
48,1,13,Peter,"Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much."
49,1,13,Eric Cartman,"That's niiice, Peter Panda."
50,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made."
51,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
52,1,13,Stan Marsh,"I donnow, just keep rolling."
53,1,13,Eric Cartman,"More tea, Rumpertumskin?"
54,1,13,Rumpertumskin,"Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome."
55,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?"
56,1,13,Clyde,I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
57,1,13,Eric Cartman,Eeeyy!
58,1,13,Kitty,Meow.
59,1,13,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!"
60,1,13,Kitty,Meow.
61,1,13,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!"
62,1,13,Kitty,Hhhhhcck!
63,1,13,Liane Cartman,"How is your beefy roast, snookums?"
64,1,13,Eric Cartman,Mom? Can I ask you a question?
65,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Sure, hon."
66,1,13,Eric Cartman,"You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?"
67,1,13,Liane Cartman,Uh huuuh.
68,1,13,Eric Cartman,"And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?"
69,1,13,Liane Cartman,Yyeess??
70,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Well, what's your question, hon?"
71,1,13,Eric Cartman,God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
72,1,13,Liane Cartman,Oooooohh.
73,1,13,Eric Cartman,I want to know where I came from.
74,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Ooohh, hhmmm [Finger to lips.]. Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other."
75,1,13,Eric Cartman,Uh huuh.
76,1,13,Liane Cartman,And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.
77,1,13,Eric Cartman,So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
78,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance."
79,1,13,Liane Cartman,I was young and naive then...
80,1,13,Man,"Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman."
81,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he. [The band ends its tune.] I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! [She stands next to Barbrady.]"
82,1,13,Trainee Barbrady,"I wouldn't mind gettin' ahold of your cookies, Ms. Cartman!"
83,1,13,Liane Cartman,"[Breathlessly.] Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady."
84,1,13,Trainee Barbrady,"[Takes a cookie and bites into it.] Mm, that's a good cookie! [The band resumes playing.]"
85,1,13,Jimbo Kern,"Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!"
86,1,13,Liane Cartman,"And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water."
87,1,13,Singing,"There you are, like a throbbing star. I want you to make love to me."
88,1,13,Liane Cartman,"I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin."
89,1,13,Eric Cartman,"So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?"
90,1,13,Liane Cartman,Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
91,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[Weighs the story.] That isn't a very romantic story, Mom."
92,1,13,Liane Cartman,I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
93,1,13,Eric Cartman,Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
94,1,13,Kitty,Meow.
95,1,13,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!"
96,1,13,Annoncer,"Coming this Sunday, [Music begins to play.] a major television event that will blow you away. Terrance. Phillip."
97,1,13,Announcer,"In the harrowing made-for-TV drama, Not Without My Anus, based on a true story."
98,1,13,Terrance,"Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter."
99,1,13,Phillip,"Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance."
100,1,13,Annoncer,See Canada's hottest stars on the HBC movie of the week.
101,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!"
102,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. It looks riveting."
103,1,13,Stan Marsh,Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
104,1,13,Grandpa Marsh,"No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show."
105,1,13,Stan Marsh,Aaawww.
106,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,[At the same time.] Hunh?
107,1,13,Annoncer,"And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos. Here is you host, Bob Saget!"
108,1,13,Bob Saget,"Hey, I just flew into the studio."
109,1,13,Bob Saget,Boy are my arms tired. Heheh. Heh.
110,1,13,Bob Saget,"Wha, Why didn't the skeleton cross the road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts."
111,1,13,Bob Saget,Knock knock.
112,1,13,Bob Saget,Bob.
113,1,13,Bob Saget,Bob Saget..
114,1,13,Stan Marsh,This guy sucks!
115,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
116,1,13,Stan Marsh,Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
117,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[Indian music plays.] Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people."
118,1,13,Stan Marsh,What??
119,1,13,Eric Cartman,Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
120,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation."
121,1,13,Stan Marsh,"What are you talking about, Cartman?!"
122,1,13,Eric Cartman,"My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?"
123,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Go ahead, dude."
124,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
125,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!"
126,1,13,Bob Saget,"Just a free li'l reminder to all of you out there: send us your stupidest home videos. Grand prize for this month will be $10,000. [Chuckles.]"
127,1,13,Grandpa Marsh,Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
128,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video."
129,1,13,Chief Running Water,...And Bear cried to Eagle-
130,1,13,Indian 1,"Running Water, there is some kid here to see you."
131,1,13,Chief Running Water,What kid?
132,1,13,Indian 1,He claims to be your kid.
133,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Hiya, Dad!"
134,1,13,Chief Running Water,Who the hell are you?
135,1,13,Eric Cartman,"I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance."
136,1,13,Chief Running Water,Your mother?
137,1,13,Eric Cartman,Liane Cartman.
138,1,13,Chief Running Water,"Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second. [Suddenly serious.] Look, kid, I'm not your father."
139,1,13,Eric Cartman,But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
140,1,13,Chief Running Water,"Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'"
141,1,13,Eric Cartman,Whatooya mean?
142,1,13,Chief Running Water,"She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'"
143,1,13,Eric Cartman,Huh??
144,1,13,Chief Running Water,Your mom's a slut.
145,1,13,Eric Cartman,Eeyy!!
146,1,13,Chief Running Water,Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.
147,1,13,Chief Running Water,"We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot."
148,1,13,Chief Running Water,There you are...
149,1,13,Chief Running Water,"I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things."
150,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder."
151,1,13,Chief Running Water,"Whoa, Helloooh!!"
152,1,13,Liane Cartman,[Interrupting the action.] Wait. Wait.
153,1,13,Liane Cartman,] Who is that?
154,1,13,Singing,There you are like a throbbing star-
155,1,13,Liane Cartman,Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
156,1,13,Chief Running Water,Huh??
157,1,13,Chief Running Water,You gotta be kidding me.
158,1,13,Liane Cartman,[Approaching Chef.] Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. [Flirts with him gently.]
159,1,13,Chef,Nawh. I'm new in town.
160,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Well, what's a nice, handsome, black [She looks at his crotch. He follows her gaze.] man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?"
161,1,13,Chef,I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
162,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?"
163,1,13,Chef,"Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?"
164,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Ahah, I'm plastered! [Tongues come out and they start kissing.]"
165,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Alone with the Chief] His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
166,1,13,Chief Running Water,He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
167,1,13,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
168,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it."
169,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
170,1,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
171,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs."
172,1,13,Stan Marsh,[With the right hand cupped to the side of his mouth.] Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
173,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[With rap beats playing now.] 'S up, homies?"
174,1,13,Stan Marsh,Cartman?!
175,1,13,Eric Cartman,I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
176,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You live on the Eastside, Cartman!"
177,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I thought you said you were Native American."
178,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Aloofly.] Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.
179,1,13,Eric Cartman,You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
180,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000."
181,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)
182,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Hold on, Kenny!"
183,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hold on, Kenny!"
184,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-
185,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(AARGH.)
186,1,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Goddamn, why-)"
187,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Oh this freakin'-)
188,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(AARGH.)
189,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Phew.)
190,1,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, I'm fine, guys!)"
191,1,13,Kenny McCormick,(Now if I can-)
192,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny."
193,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
194,1,13,Chef,Hello?
195,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Yo, Pops!"
196,1,13,Chef,"[Studying...] Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?"
197,1,13,Eric Cartman,"You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?"
198,1,13,Chef,Get in here! [Drags him in.]
199,1,13,Eric Cartman,Westsa-eed-eh.
200,1,13,Chef,Take that wig off! [Does it himself.] What's gotten into you?!
201,1,13,Eric Cartman,"You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance."
202,1,13,Chef,"What?! Noh! Uh, did I?"
203,1,13,Eric Cartman,He said you kissed her with your tongue.
204,1,13,Chef,"Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children."
205,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Dejected.] Huho. So you're not my dad?
206,1,13,Chef,"Of course not. Here. You children sit down,"
207,1,13,Chef,"...and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.

When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen,
and the two take off their clothes,
that's right,
And they caress and touch each other,
until the part of the man grows,
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot,
And the man says ""I love you"" and the woman says ""hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom""
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait...
[Pause.]
...and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says,
""Baby, I'm gettin' hot!""
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of..."
208,1,13,Eric Cartman,What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
209,1,13,Chef,"Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember."
210,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Whoa, Chef! [He pulls away a bit.] You're so strong!"
211,1,13,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!"
212,1,13,Bronco 1,Are we late for the party?
213,1,13,Bronco 2,What the hell town is this?
214,1,13,Singing,"There you are, like a throbbing star. I want-"
215,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!"
216,1,13,Chef,"Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!"
217,1,13,Liane Cartman,Woooh! Whooppee!! [She throws her arms out in ecstasy.] Unhh!
218,1,13,Chef,Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
219,1,13,Mr Garrison,"You're drunk, Mr. Hat!"
220,1,13,Singing,There you are-
221,1,13,Chef,"Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!"
222,1,13,Liane Cartman,"Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a menage o'three?"
223,1,13,Chef,Yeah! When two women are involved. [Moves away.]
224,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman."
225,1,13,Chef,And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
226,1,13,Eric Cartman,"No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!"
227,1,13,Announcer,"And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-"
228,1,13,Bob Saget,Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
229,1,13,Eric Cartman,"Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend."
230,1,13,Polly,"I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all."
231,1,13,Eric Cartman,Really? You don't think so?
232,1,13,Clyde,"Naw, you're not fat."
233,1,13,Eric Cartman,"[Grabs a teacup.] Gee, that's kewl."
234,1,13,Sharon Marsh,"Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning."
235,1,13,Stan Marsh,Huh? [Looks up at them.] Oh yeah.
236,1,13,Randy Marsh,"Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?"
237,1,13,Stan Marsh,How 'bout some ice cream?
238,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, with butterscotch."
239,1,13,Sharon Marsh,"You bet, you poor dears."
240,1,13,Bob Saget,"Now, the moment you've all been waiting for, when one of our lucky videos qualifies for the $10,000 Grand Prize to be chosen tomorrow night! The winner is [Drumroll crescendo.] Little Boy's Tea Party."
241,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,Woohoo!
242,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!"
243,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"We're gonna win $10,000! [Grandpa doesn't look pleased...]"
244,1,13,Stan Marsh,Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! [Kyle dances gleefully.]
245,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat."
246,1,13,Mr Hat,"Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison."
247,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem! [To the barkeep.] Another Cosmo, please."
248,1,13,Eric Cartman,"All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!"
249,1,13,Mr Garrison,"What the hell are you talking about, Eric?"
250,1,13,Eric Cartman,It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
251,1,13,Mr Garrison,[Gasps.] Oh.
252,1,13,Jimbo Kern,Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.
253,1,13,Mr Garrison,I am not gay!
254,1,13,Eric Cartman,Then you did sleep with my mom?
255,1,13,Mr Garrison,No!
256,1,13,Jimbo Kern,He's gay!!
257,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!"
258,1,13,Mr Garrison,"Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?"
259,1,13,Principal Victoria,Oooooh.
260,1,13,Mayor McDaniels,[At the same time] Hmmm.
261,1,13,Grizzled Man,I haven't.
262,1,13,Mr Garrison,"...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!"
263,1,13,Halfy,Oh. Yeah.
264,1,13,Mr Garrison,"So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know."
265,1,13,Jimbo Kern,"[Approaching him.] Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean."
266,1,13,Mephesto,"Wait, wait. [Cartman stops.] I know a way to find out."
267,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Turns around.] How?
268,1,13,Mephesto,"At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is."
269,1,13,Eric Cartman,Really? You can? [The dirge turns hopeful.]
270,1,13,Mephesto,"Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but..."
271,1,13,Eric Cartman,How much?
272,1,13,Mephesto,Three thousand should cover it.

325,1,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!"
326,1,13,Mephesto,The test results are in this envelope.
327,1,13,Mephesto,Shall I... open it?
328,1,13,Mr Garrison,"[Impatiently.] Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!"
329,1,13,Mephesto,"Erhum ehrum uh [Gasps.] The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-"
330,1,13,Announcer,[An organ plays.] Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is it - Chief Running Water? [Looks askance.] Or is it - Chef? Is it Mephesto? [Looks around.] Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison?
331,1,13,Jimbo Kern,Nope. He's gay.
332,1,13,Mr Garrison,You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
333,1,13,Announcer,Is it Jimbo?
334,1,13,Jimbo Kern,[Aghast.] Daaagh!
335,1,13,Announcer,Or is Officer Barbrady?
336,1,13,Officer Barbrady,Huh?! Where?!
337,1,13,Announcer,Or could it be Ned?
338,1,13,Ned Gerblansky,Could be.
339,1,13,Announcer,Or Mr. Broflovski??
340,1,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[Pissed.] Dad, how could you?!"
341,1,13,Announcer,"Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new South Park, in just four weeks."
342,1,13,Eric Cartman,[Record scratches.] What?! [Enunciating] Son of a bitch!
