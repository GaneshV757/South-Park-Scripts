1,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
2,1,8,Liane Cartman,Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
3,1,8,Eric Cartman,Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
4,1,8,Liane Cartman,Sure hon.
5,1,8,Eric Cartman,"And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!"
6,1,8,Phillip,Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
7,1,8,Terrance,It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.
8,1,8,Phillip,AAAAAH!
9,1,8,Phillip,Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
10,1,8,Eric Cartman,Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
11,1,8,TV Announcer,"Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs."
12,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, cool."
13,1,8,TV Announcer,And now a word from our sponsor.
14,1,8,Sally Struthers,"Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help."
15,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, who's that fat chick?"
16,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House."
17,1,8,Stan Marsh,Oh.
18,1,8,Sally Struthers,"You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce."
19,1,8,Stan Marsh,Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
20,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman."
21,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, HEY!"
22,1,8,Sally Struthers,For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.
23,1,8,Eric Cartman,"That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?"
24,1,8,Sally Struthers,Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.
25,1,8,Eric Cartman,KICK ASS!!
26,1,8,Stan Marsh,SWEET!
27,1,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
28,1,8,Stan Marsh,I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
29,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Did they say if it's waterproof?
30,1,8,Stan Marsh,Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?
31,1,8,Stan Marsh,Oh.
32,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,What did she say?
33,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear."
34,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Ass-rammer.
35,1,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
36,1,8,Eric Cartman,When do we get the sports watch?
37,1,8,Stan Marsh,Just a second fat-ass!
38,1,8,Eric Cartman,You vas-deferens!
39,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Hello? No, no, it's a ma- [To his friends, confused.] Vas-deferens?"
40,1,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)"
41,1,8,Stan Marsh,Oh.
42,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Ask her if we get the watch right away.
43,1,8,Stan Marsh,Do we get the sports watch right away?
44,1,8,Stan Marsh,She says we do.
45,1,8,All,Cool.
46,1,8,Eric Cartman,"I get to wear it first, you guys."
47,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
48,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said."
49,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?"
50,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Yes, Eric?"
51,1,8,Eric Cartman,When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
52,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people."
53,1,8,Mr Garrison,A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
54,1,8,Stan Marsh,"You mean, like Kenny?"
55,1,8,Mr Garrison,Exactly.
56,1,8,Eric Cartman,Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
57,1,8,Mr Garrison,"[Impatiently.] I don't know Eric, they just do."
58,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people."
59,1,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!"
60,1,8,Wendy Testaburger,Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
61,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!"
62,1,8,Wendy Testaburger,This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
63,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!"
64,1,8,Wendy Testaburger,Many would rather die than go to those places!
65,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!"
66,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?"
67,1,8,Mr Hat,"That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?"
68,1,8,Clyde Donovan,Aaaah!
69,1,8,Mr Garrison,What the hell is going on?!
70,1,8,Clyde Donovan,Aaaah!
71,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, you don't see that everyday."
72,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor."
73,1,8,Aide 2,It should be something festive.
74,1,8,Mephesto,"Mayor, we've got a very big problem."
75,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?"
76,1,8,Mephesto,"Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving."
77,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,[Warily.] Uh huh.
78,1,8,Mephesto,"You know, to provide food for the needy."
79,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,[Sarcastically.] Of course.
80,1,8,Mephesto,"Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off."
81,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Naturally.
82,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, do go on."
83,1,8,Mephesto,"We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short."
84,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,You were saying?
85,1,8,Mephesto,"They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil."
86,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"[With feigned shock.] Oh, my!"
87,1,8,Mephesto,Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.
88,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Uh now why would you say that?
89,1,8,Everybody,Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?
90,1,8,Eric Cartman,"I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?"
91,1,8,Liane Cartman,[Peeks.] Not yet hon.
92,1,8,Stan Marsh,Damn.
93,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look you guys."
94,1,8,TV Announcer,"And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special."
95,1,8,Terrance,"I sure am cold, Phillip."
96,1,8,Phillip,"Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass."
97,1,8,Terrance,"Gosh, I hope we don't starve."
98,1,8,Phillip,"Ah, a squeaker!"
99,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,The digital sports watch is here.
100,1,8,Eric Cartman,What the hell?
101,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that's not a digital sports watch."
102,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians."
103,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch."
104,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.
105,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! That was cool.
106,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?"
107,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,What's your name dude?
108,1,8,Kid,Mabin.
109,1,8,Stan Marsh,I think he said his name is Marvin.
110,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Starvin' Marvin."
111,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
112,1,8,Eric Cartman,Hey mooom?
113,1,8,Liane Cartman,Yes hon?
114,1,8,Eric Cartman,"We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?"
115,1,8,Liane Cartman,"Sure, hon."
116,1,8,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
117,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow."
118,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother."
119,1,8,Eric Cartman,No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
120,1,8,Stan Marsh,It was my mom's credit card.
121,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me."
122,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor."
123,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Totally.
124,1,8,Eric Cartman,Ahh!
125,1,8,Woman,Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
126,1,8,Man,Not as beautiful as you.
127,1,8,Woman,[Swooning.] Ooooh.
128,1,8,Man,"Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys."
129,1,8,Woman,"Oohh, they're so beautiful."
130,1,8,Man,Not as beautiful as you.
131,1,8,Woman,"Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer."
132,1,8,Man,Not as beautiful as-
133,1,8,Stan Marsh,This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
134,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income."
135,1,8,Eric Cartman,Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
136,1,8,Eric Cartman,"You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers."
137,1,8,Marvin,Ap-ee-tizer.
138,1,8,Eric Cartman,"This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry."
139,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers."
140,1,8,Eric Cartman,"No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie."
141,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share."
142,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right."
143,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive."
144,1,8,Mr Garrison,And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?
145,1,8,Mr Garrison,Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.
146,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell."
147,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, yeah, we do!"
148,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that's right."
149,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,We do!
150,1,8,Mr Garrison,"All right boys, show us what you've brought."
151,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin."
152,1,8,Stan Marsh,He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
153,1,8,Eric Cartman,"No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn."
154,1,8,Eric Cartman,"No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!"
155,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?"
156,1,8,Stan Marsh,He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
157,1,8,Mr Garrison,The sports watch from the commercial?
158,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that one."
159,1,8,Bebe Stevens,I want a Starvin' Marvin.
160,1,8,Clyde Donovan,Me too.
161,1,8,Pip Pirrip,"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
162,1,8,Class,"Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me."
163,1,8,Mr Garrison,"Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned."
164,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude."
165,1,8,Principal Victoria,"Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now."
166,1,8,Principal Victoria,"Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson."
167,1,8,Stan Marsh,No.
168,1,8,Principal Victoria,You can't care for this child!
169,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
170,1,8,Principal Victoria,"Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park."
171,1,8,Stan Marsh,So why can't he live here now?
172,1,8,Principal Victoria,Because he can't!
173,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Because why?
174,1,8,Principal Victoria,Because eight-year olds can't be parents!
175,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Then you take care of him.
176,1,8,Principal Victoria,"[on the spot] I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy."
177,1,8,Principal Victoria,"I send my five dollars a month, see?"
178,1,8,Stan Marsh,"This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend."
179,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh well, back to the poor country with you."
180,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
181,1,8,Eric Cartman,"B-huh, huh. Yeah, right."
182,1,8,Mephesto,I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.
183,1,8,Chef,"Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees."
184,1,8,Mephesto,Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.
185,1,8,Chef,"Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts."
186,1,8,Mephesto,"Oh, whoops."
187,1,8,Mephesto,Now tell me what you see.
188,1,8,Chef,"Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA."
189,1,8,Mephesto,"Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing."
190,1,8,Chef,What does it mean?
191,1,8,Mephesto,"Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world."
192,1,8,Chef,"Oh, fudge!"
193,1,8,Chef,"Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again."
194,1,8,Mephesto,Sure.
195,1,8,Agent 1,"Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch."
196,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, hey, what's going on?!"
197,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!"
198,1,8,Agent 1,"Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up."
199,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!"
200,1,8,Marvin,Sweet.
201,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,So how does this thing work?
202,1,8,Aide,"Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family."
203,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,POVVVV?
204,1,8,Aide,Poverty stricken citizen.
205,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Ohhoho, brilliant."
206,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Daah!! What the hell is this!!
207,1,8,Aide,"I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program."
208,1,8,Mephesto,They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.
209,1,8,Chef,"It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!"
210,1,8,Chef,"Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!"
211,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
212,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!"
213,1,8,Mephesto,We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!
214,1,8,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?"
215,1,8,Phillip,"Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon."
216,1,8,Terrance,"Huh, eh,"
217,1,8,Terrance,wait wait wait.
218,1,8,Terrance,"Eh, eh."
219,1,8,Terrance,"Here it comes, ehhhh."
220,1,8,Terrance,"Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!"
221,1,8,Phillip,Aaaah.
222,1,8,Phillip,I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.
223,1,8,Terrance,I spattered his face!
224,1,8,Phillip,Now he's a smelly Indian.
225,1,8,TV Announcer,"We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this."
226,1,8,Sally Struthers,Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.
227,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!"
228,1,8,Sally Struthers,"So please, call and adopt a child today."
229,1,8,Eric Cartman,I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
230,1,8,Liane Cartman,You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?
231,1,8,Marvin,"Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof."
232,1,8,Liane Cartman,Okay.
233,1,8,Marvin,Sweet.
234,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere."
235,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?"
236,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, screw you too!"
237,1,8,Eric Cartman,What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
238,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa."
239,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, where's Cartman?"
240,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?"
241,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.
242,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Come on, hurry up."
243,1,8,Mrs McCormick,Grab a lot son.
244,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!
245,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!"
246,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kenny!"
247,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Kenny!"
248,1,8,Stuart McCormick,"Come on, son!"
249,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family."
250,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe.
251,1,8,Chef,What the-?!
252,1,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!"
253,1,8,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos."
254,1,8,Mephesto,"I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen."
255,1,8,Chef,"Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your..."
256,1,8,Chef,What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
257,1,8,Mephesto,That's not important right now.
258,1,8,Chef,No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
259,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Chef, the turkeys!"
260,1,8,Chef,"Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!"
261,1,8,Chef,We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
262,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat."
263,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!"
264,1,8,Eric Cartman,I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
265,1,8,Red Cross Dude,"Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding."
266,1,8,Eric Cartman,What?!
267,1,8,Red Cross Dude,"We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up."
268,1,8,Eric Cartman,But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
269,1,8,Red Cross Dude,"Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch."
270,1,8,Eric Cartman,WEEEEEEAK!!!
271,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,"People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys."
272,1,8,Townsperson 1,There's too many of them.
273,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!
274,1,8,Townsperson 2,We can't stop them.
275,1,8,Chef,"Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!"
276,1,8,Crowd,"Wooo, yeahhh, woo."
277,1,8,Leader Turkey,"Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!"
278,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,Here you go turkeys!
279,1,8,Mayor McDaniels,Does my hair look okay?
280,1,8,Eric Cartman,Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
281,1,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh."
282,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err."
283,1,8,Eric Cartman,"Huh, I wonder what's in here?"
284,1,8,Eric Cartman,SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!

292,1,8,Eric Cartman,"You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!"
293,1,8,Sally Struthers,Uh oh.

300,1,8,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
301,1,8,Jimbo,"The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned."
302,1,8,Stan Marsh,We did it!!
303,1,8,Mephesto,"My God, what have we done?"
304,1,8,Chef,We've saved Thanksgiving!
305,1,8,Mephesto,"But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead."
