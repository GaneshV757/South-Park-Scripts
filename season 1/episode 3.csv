0,1,3,Liane Cartman,"Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous."
1,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Mom."
2,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Ready to go hunting, Cartman?"
3,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?"
4,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning."
5,1,3,Liane Cartman,"Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts."
6,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe."
7,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?"
8,1,3,Liane Cartman,"Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy."
9,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that's sick mom."
10,1,3,Liane Cartman,"And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away."
11,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Drive, Drive!"
12,1,3,Liane Cartman,You give your mommy a kissy.
13,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Drive the car damn-it, drive!"
14,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,[In a slight falsetto.] Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
15,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing."
16,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman."
17,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(Maybe she'll suck my dick.)
18,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, ho, that's disgusting."
19,1,3,Eric Cartman,"You piece of crap, I'll kill you!"
20,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'."
21,1,3,Eric Cartman,Eeeeenh!
22,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber."
23,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer."
24,1,3,Jimbo Kern,You what?!?
25,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm."
26,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,I like chocolate milk.
27,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization."
28,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes."
29,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I didn't get a gun."
30,1,3,Eric Cartman,Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
31,1,3,Stan Marsh,"You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman."
32,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,Were you stationed in Da Nang?
33,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says."
34,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off."
35,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer."
36,1,3,Stan Marsh,"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa."
37,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that'd be cool."
38,1,3,Eric Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
39,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!"
40,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there."
41,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality."
42,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean?
43,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting."
44,1,3,Eric Cartman,Democrats piss me off!
45,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'"
46,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo."
47,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, Jimbo look, mm."
48,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!"
49,1,3,Eric Cartman,Kickass!!
50,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck."
51,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock."
52,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"[Drops to the ground.] Let's move, moove!"
53,1,3,Stan Marsh,Is this hunting?
54,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,I guess so.
55,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks."
56,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
57,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!"
58,1,3,Jimbo Kern,This one's yours Stan.
59,1,3,Jimbo Kern,[Calmly.]It's coming right for us.
60,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,It's coming right for us.
61,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Shoot it Stan.
62,1,3,Eric Cartman,"I got your back, soldier."
63,1,3,Stan Marsh,I can't.
64,1,3,Jimbo Kern,What the? What's wrong with you?
65,1,3,Stan Marsh,I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
66,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical."
67,1,3,Stan Marsh,"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny."
68,1,3,Jimbo Kern,No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.
69,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything."
70,1,3,Stan Marsh,"I can shoot you, fat ass!"
71,1,3,Eric Cartman,I can shoot you too!
72,1,3,Stan Marsh,I'll kill you!
73,1,3,Eric Cartman,I'll fill you full of lead!
74,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, what's that?"
75,1,3,Randy Marsh,What the heck is this?
76,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check."
77,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!"
78,1,3,Eric Cartman,My weenies won't cook.
79,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm."
80,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick."
81,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, yepper."
82,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, aahh, oh."
83,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!"
84,1,3,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
85,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa!
86,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?"
87,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm."
88,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah."
89,1,3,Chef,"But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?"
90,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but..."
91,1,3,Johnson,"Mayor, the geologist is here to see you."
92,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
93,1,3,Johnson,"No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth."
94,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!"
95,1,3,Johnson,"I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker."
96,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,Just send in the geometrist.
97,1,3,Johnson,Geologist...
98,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"You are fired, buddy!"
99,1,3,Johnson,"Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you."
100,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt."
101,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,What does this mean to the town?
102,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad."
103,1,3,Randy Marsh,Right now South Park is here.
104,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,My God!
105,1,3,Chef,"Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!"
106,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? [Beeps out.]"
107,1,3,Ted,"Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted."
108,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. [Thump.] Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control."
109,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day."
110,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmowwwh.
111,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hah, got ya."
112,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Heh, tha-that's not scary."
113,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!
114,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!"
115,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hey Ned, hand me that gin."
116,1,3,Jimbo Kern,You boys want to tie one on?
117,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee."
118,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Cartman's pee."
119,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you would taste my pee!"
120,1,3,Jimbo Kern,What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?
121,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Christ, look at that little bastard go!"
122,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!"
123,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too."
124,1,3,Eric Cartman,Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
125,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!"
126,1,3,Eric Cartman,Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt?
127,1,3,Stan Marsh,Whatabutt?
128,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top."
129,1,3,Stan Marsh,Why?
130,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body."
131,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Deformed how?
132,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has..."
133,1,3,Stan Marsh,A hook.
134,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,A knife.
135,1,3,Eric Cartman,No! A piece of celery.
136,1,3,Stan Marsh,Celery?
137,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy."
138,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!"
139,1,3,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink."
140,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories."
141,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, give me that flashlight."
142,1,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, what's that?)"
143,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,What is that?
144,1,3,Stan Marsh,Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
145,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, it might be!"
146,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand."
147,1,3,Eric Cartman,Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
148,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song."
149,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
[Uncle Jimbo cries]
Mmmoh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah..."
150,1,3,Eric Cartman,They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
151,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"...Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah."
152,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, Stan, wake up!"
153,1,3,Stan Marsh,"What, dude?"
154,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
155,1,3,Stan Marsh,Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
156,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,They're out fishing with Kenny.
157,1,3,Stan Marsh,"With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?"
158,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well Stan, you want to know what I think?"
159,1,3,Stan Marsh,What?
160,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!"
161,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, got it."
162,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Great instincts boy.
163,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!"
164,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Who? The fat kid?
165,1,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
166,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!"
167,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit."
168,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,[Rowing to shore.] Moh man it smells like dead fish here.
169,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(A little like a vagina.)
170,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Em-moh man, that is nasty."
171,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew."
172,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(Thanks.)
173,1,3,Newscaster,"The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony."
174,1,3,Crowd,Yeahhh.
175,1,3,Individual in crowd,"Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!"
176,1,3,Newscaster,"Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?"
177,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"All we know right now is that some of our children [Sob-sob.] are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?"
178,1,3,Newscaster,Huh?
179,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 [Melodramatically.] All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids."
180,1,3,Chef,Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
181,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off."
182,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm."
183,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on."
184,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast."
185,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.
186,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!"
187,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun."
188,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Look!
189,1,3,Eric Cartman,"I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg."
190,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, what is it?"
191,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying."
192,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
193,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"We'll be on the cover of ""Guns & Ammo""."
194,1,3,Jimbo Kern,This calls for some HJ-14.
195,1,3,Eric Cartman,[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
196,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Fire in the hoooole!
197,1,3,Eric Cartman,Holy crap!
198,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Damn it, I think I missed."
199,1,3,Eric Cartman,What the hell is wrong with you people?!
200,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"C'mon, let's move, move!"
201,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, wait, aah!"
202,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!"
203,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea."
204,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Huh, what?"
205,1,3,Randy Marsh,"Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely."
206,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"And, that would be good? Right?"
207,1,3,Randy Marsh,Uh - pretty sure.
208,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!"
209,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! [Shoots a bald eagle.] The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe."
210,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[Sees Cartman still dressed as Scuzzlebutt] Look, up there."
211,1,3,Eric Cartman,"You guys, it's just me."
212,1,3,Jimbo Kern,Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
213,1,3,Stan Marsh,Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
214,1,3,Jimbo Kern,I can't tell; let's kill it!
215,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume."
216,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Kenny, you take the front."
217,1,3,Stan Marsh,No!
218,1,3,Stan Marsh,I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
219,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!"
220,1,3,Eric Cartman,"You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!"
221,1,3,Newscaster,"As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary."
222,1,3,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please."
223,1,3,Host,"Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a [Film skips] May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt."
224,1,3,Host,"That's right Jane, duck and cover."
225,1,3,Host,So what will you [Film skips] -do when you hear a volcano erupting?
226,1,3,Host,"That's right, duck and cover."
227,1,3,Host,Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.
228,1,3,Officer Barbrady,"OK, any questions?"
229,1,3,Chef,That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
230,1,3,Officer Barbrady,That's enough out of you!
231,1,3,Stan Marsh,I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
232,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, seriously you guys!"
233,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[Hushed.] Kill it, Stan. Kill it. [Normally.] Come on Stan, kill it."
234,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Ah, damn it, I can't do it!"
235,1,3,Jimbo Kern,You pansy! give me that gun.
236,1,3,Eric Cartman,Hey!
237,1,3,Stan Marsh,Cartman?
238,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Goddammit, don't shoot me!"
239,1,3,Jimbo Kern,What the Sam Hell?
240,1,3,Eric Cartman,"I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now."
241,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, so much for the cover of ""Guns & Ammo""."
242,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-"
243,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa!
244,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm, holy crap."
245,1,3,Jimbo Kern,The mountain! It's blown it's top!
246,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
247,1,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Nope, I'm okay.)"
248,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)
249,1,3,Kenny McCormick,(Ugh.)
250,1,3,Townsman 1,"Look, the volcano."
251,1,3,Townsman 2,"Quick, duck and cover."
252,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Aaaaah!
253,1,3,Stan Marsh,Aaaaah!
254,1,3,Eric Cartman,Aaaaah!
255,1,3,Jimbo Kern,That lava's coming right for us!!
256,1,3,Chef,"Oh no, look."
257,1,3,Jimbo Kern,What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
258,1,3,Newscaster,"It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava."
259,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-"
260,1,3,Eric Cartman,Help!
261,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!"
262,1,3,Eric Cartman,What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
263,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God! Look at his leg!
264,1,3,Patrick Duffy,"Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy."
265,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Quick Ned, shoot it!"
266,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmmoh no, out of ammo."
267,1,3,Scuzzlebutt,Grrrr.
268,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,What... is that thing?
269,1,3,Chef,That's Scuzzlebutt.
270,1,3,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets."
271,1,3,Officer Barbrady,This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
272,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed."
273,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,Aaaaah!
274,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, he built a wicker basket."
275,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Hey, he's saving us."
276,1,3,Scuzzlebutt,Grrr.
277,1,3,Liane Cartman,Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
278,1,3,Randy Marsh,And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
279,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
280,1,3,Randy Marsh,Uhh...
281,1,3,Denver citizens,Aaaaah.
282,1,3,Mr Garrison,South Park is saved.
283,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey look, Kenny's okay."
284,1,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey guys, what's goin' down?)"
285,1,3,Newscaster,And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
286,1,3,Chef,"Mmmm
Baby every time that we kiss,
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava,
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat,
Lava so warm and red and wet,
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr."
287,1,3,Newscaster,"Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?"
288,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt."
289,1,3,Scuzzlebutt,Friend.
290,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, how sweet."
291,1,3,Stan Marsh,"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something."
292,1,3,Newscaster,Oh my God! What has he done?
293,1,3,Mayor McDaniels,Turn off the cameras!
294,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, that was easy!"
295,1,3,Patrick Duffy,Noooo! Why God? Why?!
296,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!"
297,1,3,Stan Marsh,What?! Why?!
298,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, make up your mind, dude!"
299,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?"
300,1,3,Stan Marsh,No.
301,1,3,Ned Gerblansky,"Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm."
302,1,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh, no!)"
303,1,3,Stan Marsh,"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny."
304,1,3,Jimbo Kern,"But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?"
305,1,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I don't understand hunting at all."
306,1,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, [He drops his gun.] it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons."
307,1,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.]"
