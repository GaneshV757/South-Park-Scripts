0,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan..."
1,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What is this, Cartman?"
2,1,10,Eric Cartman,They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
3,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?"
4,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday..."
5,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever."
6,1,10,Eric Cartman,That's right.
7,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too."
8,1,10,Eric Cartman,That's ri-aayy.
9,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation."
10,1,10,Eric Cartman,"[darting over] Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!"
11,1,10,Eric Cartman,I shoved it up my ass!
12,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!"
13,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde..."
14,1,10,Mr Garrison,"[excitedly] Children, children! Today is a very special day."
15,1,10,Eric Cartman,"No, my birthday isn't until Saturday."
16,1,10,Mr Garrison,"I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today."
17,1,10,Eric Cartman,Eeeeeeh!
18,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... [leans down to the new kid, Damien] uh-uh, what's your name again?"
19,1,10,Damien Thorn,Damien!
20,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus...dominus...
21,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Say 'hi' to Damien! [Silence.] And where are you from, Damien?"
22,1,10,Damien Thorn,The seventh layer of hell!
23,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama."
24,1,10,Damien Thorn,"My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father!"
25,1,10,Ominous Voice,... rectus... cheesy poofs...
26,1,10,Mr Garrison,Your father?
27,1,10,Damien Thorn,The Prince of Darkness!
28,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era."
29,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass..."
30,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?"
31,1,10,Damien Thorn,Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
32,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?"
33,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus... dominus...
34,1,10,Eric Cartman,Byah. Oof!
35,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude!"
36,1,10,Ominous Voice,Sancti...
37,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn, what a freak!"
38,1,10,Eric Cartman,[Getting up off the floor.] Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!
39,1,10,Ominous Voice,Cheesy poofs...
40,1,10,Damien Thorn,Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
41,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?"
42,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Eheh. [Taunting.] You got in trouble, you got in trouble."
43,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?"
44,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
45,1,10,Eric Cartman,Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
46,1,10,Stan Marsh,Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
47,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that's weak!"
48,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?"
49,1,10,Stan Marsh,Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
50,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then."
51,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is."
52,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is."
53,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?"
54,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!"
55,1,10,Damien Thorn,Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
56,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!"
57,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two."
58,1,10,Eric Cartman,Eeyy!
59,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me."
60,1,10,Damien Thorn,Then I will call you Pip.
61,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Right-o.
62,1,10,Stan Marsh,Hey new kid!
63,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog."
64,1,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)"
65,1,10,Damien Thorn,That does it! Woo-paah.
66,1,10,Ominous Voice,... rectus... dominus...
67,1,10,Stan Marsh,What the...Â ?
68,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
69,1,10,Stan Marsh,A what?
70,1,10,Kenny McCormick,Quack-quack.
71,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!"
72,1,10,Chef,"Hello there, children."
73,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Chef."
74,1,10,Chef,How's it going?
75,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Bad.
76,1,10,Chef,Why bad?
77,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak."
78,1,10,Chef,"Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song, 
We're all special in our own way
everybody's different, but that's okay,
'cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin,
different points of view, be tall or thin,
it doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin,"
79,1,10,Chef,"With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,"
80,1,10,Chef,"Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh..."
81,1,10,Chef,What were we talking about again?
82,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,The new kid.
83,1,10,Damien Thorn,Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all!
84,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs...
85,1,10,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
86,1,10,Chef,Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!
87,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"We told you, dude."
88,1,10,Chef,"We've got to do something, children!"
89,1,10,Damien Thorn,Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus!
90,1,10,Ominous Voice,... rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... rectus... dominus...
91,1,10,Stan Marsh,Jesus?
92,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus?
93,1,10,Roland,"Two minutes to air, Jesus."
94,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. [Stan and Kyle dash in.]"
95,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, Jesus!"
96,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show."
97,1,10,Stan Marsh,"No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil."
98,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny."
99,1,10,Kenny McCormick,Quack-quack.
100,1,10,Jesus Christ,Wow. That's pretty heavy.
101,1,10,Stan Marsh,"This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you."
102,1,10,Jesus Christ,The Dark Prince?
103,1,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
104,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
105,1,10,Jesus Christ,"So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One."
106,1,10,Stan Marsh,[To Kyle.] Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
107,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth."
108,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,... K.
109,1,10,Groundskeeper,"Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!"
110,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money..."
111,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus... dominus... sancti...
112,1,10,Red,Aaaaa Bebe!
113,1,10,Bebe Stevens,Our slide!
114,1,10,Damien Thorn,Feel my wrath!
115,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"[As Damien torches the hobby elephants.] Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday."
116,1,10,Damien Thorn,I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan!
117,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.
118,1,10,Ominous Voice,... Rectus... cheesy poofs...
119,1,10,Jesus Christ,Damien!
120,1,10,Damien Thorn,Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
121,1,10,Jesus Christ,"So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!"
122,1,10,Damien Thorn,"Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes."
123,1,10,Jesus Christ,Let him come then. I shall stop him!
124,1,10,Damien Thorn,Behold! He is already upon us! [Clouds begin to conceal the sun.
125,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ohh, dude!"
126,1,10,Satan,Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
127,1,10,Jimbo Kern,What the hell's going on here?
128,1,10,Father Maxi,Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
129,1,10,Blonde,What's happening?
130,1,10,Chef,"Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!"
131,1,10,Chef,"Not you, dammit!"
132,1,10,Satan,Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
133,1,10,Damien Thorn,"Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!"
134,1,10,Jesus Christ,Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
135,1,10,Jimbo Kern,"Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!"
136,1,10,Stan Marsh,You're gonna fight Satan?
137,1,10,Jesus Christ,"This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history."
138,1,10,Commercial,Who will win our souls?
139,1,10,Commercial,Our Savior and Lord?
140,1,10,Commercial,Or the Prince of Darkness?
141,1,10,Commercial,It's the final battle between Good and Evil.
142,1,10,Commercial,"And it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95."
143,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!"
144,1,10,Kenny McCormick,Quack-quack.
145,1,10,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?"
146,1,10,Eric Cartman,Cartman's birthday!
147,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
148,1,10,Eric Cartman,"You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel."
149,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in."
150,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!"
151,1,10,Father Maxi,When is Satan gonna show up?
152,1,10,Stan Marsh,Did the Devil show up yet?
153,1,10,Jesus Christ,Not yet.
154,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?"
155,1,10,Jesus Christ,... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
156,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish."
157,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oh.
158,1,10,Jimbo Kern,"We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince."
159,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation."
160,1,10,Father Maxi,"You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus."
161,1,10,Ominous Vocie,Rectus... dominus...
162,1,10,Jesus Christ,Behold. The Evil One approaches.
163,1,10,Satan,Yeah.
164,1,10,Mr Garrison,Holy poop on a stick!
165,1,10,Satan,Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!
166,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge."
167,1,10,Jimbo Kern,Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
168,1,10,Satan,"Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!"
169,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oh - oh yeah??
170,1,10,Man in crowd,Damn.
171,1,10,Satan,I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.
172,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oh yeah??
173,1,10,Announcer,"Satan weighs in at - 320 lbs, 4 oz."
174,1,10,Announcer,"Jesus Christ weighs in at - 135 lbs., 1 oz."
175,1,10,Chef,Ooh crap.
176,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Aw, come on! I weigh more than that."
177,1,10,Satan,"Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world."
178,1,10,Jimbo Kern,[Holding his ticket up.] Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
179,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too."
180,1,10,Father Maxi,Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck.
181,1,10,Man 1,Change my bet!
182,1,10,Man 2,I'm betting on the Devil!
183,1,10,Jimbo Kern,I wanna change my bet to Satan.
184,1,10,Ned Gerblansky,"Me, too."
185,1,10,Mr Garrison,Wai-wa I was here first.
186,1,10,Mr Mackey,"Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay?"
187,1,10,Damien Thorn,Everybody hates me!
188,1,10,Mr Mackey,Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
189,1,10,Damien Thorn,Because I'm the son of the Devil?
190,1,10,Mr Mackey,"Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?"
191,1,10,Damien Thorn,Because I... burn them and kill them?
192,1,10,Mr Mackey,"Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. And no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. You be passive, m'kay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now."
193,1,10,Clyde Donovan,I bet I can spit the most on him.
194,1,10,Bebe Stevens,Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.
195,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
196,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'."
197,1,10,Eric Cartman,"[Sees Damien coming.] Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!"
198,1,10,Damien Thorn,I apologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice.
199,1,10,Eric Cartman,"[Farts and moves away.] Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!"
200,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart."
201,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on.
202,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Bubye, Fart-boy."
203,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,See ya.
204,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Good day, Damien. How are you?"
205,1,10,Damien Thorn,"Those guys farted on me, and then called me-"
206,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
207,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-"
208,1,10,Chef,Oh ooh.
209,1,10,Jesus Christ,I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.
210,1,10,Jesus Christ,"In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!"
211,1,10,Father Maxi,"You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!"
212,1,10,Jesus Christ,Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
213,1,10,Father Maxi,"Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus."
214,1,10,Jesus Christ,I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
215,1,10,Father Maxi,"Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!"
216,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too."
217,1,10,Jimbo Kern,Yeah.
218,1,10,Father Maxi,Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.
219,1,10,Father Maxi,"What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?"
220,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, crazy."
221,1,10,Mr Allen,He's so gay.
222,1,10,Mr McDonald,Yeah.
223,1,10,Jesus Christ,You're all a bunch of Judases!
224,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Jesus."
225,1,10,Jesus Christ,"What are you doing out so late, kids?"
226,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
227,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right?"
228,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God."
229,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?"
230,1,10,Jesus Christ,"No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?"
231,1,10,Reporter 1,"Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?"
232,1,10,Satan,I will crush him like a little bug!
233,1,10,Reporter 2,"Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War?"
234,1,10,Don King,"Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring."
235,1,10,Eric Cartman,"You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?"
236,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs."
237,1,10,Jesus Christ,"No way, dude!"
238,1,10,Chef,[In the ring.] Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
239,1,10,Stan Marsh,"But you're his sparring partner, Chef."
240,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you have to hit him."
241,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train."
242,1,10,Chef,Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
243,1,10,Jesus Christ,Give it your best sho- [Poof.] Oh! [Falls back to the floor.]
244,1,10,Chef,Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
245,1,10,Jesus Christ,Anybody get the number of that truck? [Drops his head.]
246,1,10,Liane Cartman,"Come on, kiddies. Eat more."
247,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef."
248,1,10,Chef,"Yup! Here's your present, children."
249,1,10,Chef,"Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later."
250,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, you just got here, Chef!"
251,1,10,Chef,"I know, but the fight is starting."
252,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili."
253,1,10,Liane Cartman,Mmmmm.
254,1,10,Chef,Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
255,1,10,Damien Thorn,I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
256,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there."
257,1,10,Damien Thorn,The other kids have always hated you?
258,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me."
259,1,10,Michael Buffer,"In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!"
260,1,10,Michael Buffer,"And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!"
261,1,10,Michael Buffer,"Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!"
262,1,10,Referee Mills Lane,"Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles."
263,1,10,Eric Cartman,Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
264,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid."
265,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"And neither were you, Pip!"
266,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-"
267,1,10,Damien Thorn,Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.
268,1,10,Ominous Voice,Rectus... dominus...
269,1,10,Ominous Voice,... Sancti... cheesy poofs...
270,1,10,Pip Pirrip,Aaaa!

273,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, that was cool!"
274,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien."
275,1,10,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased]
276,1,10,Satan,"Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!"
277,1,10,Eric Cartman,"Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves.] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[She leaves.] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? [Thumps the table in anger.]"
278,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"It's a game, dude. It's really fun."
279,1,10,Eric Cartman,YOU SON OF A BITCH! [Lunges towards Kyle.]
280,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,[As he is pinned by Cartman.] Aaaaa!
281,1,10,Eric Cartman,"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! [Slapping him around by now.]"
282,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,They were all out of 'em dude!
283,1,10,Eric Cartman,I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
284,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,[At the same time.] Aaaaaaaa!
285,1,10,Eric Cartman,That's it! Party is over!
286,1,10,Eric Cartman,Everybody go home!
287,1,10,Eric Cartman,"GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT!"
288,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!"
289,1,10,Eric Cartman,Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
290,1,10,Damien Thorn,Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.
291,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Aaanh, he does this all the time."
292,1,10,Chef,"Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!"
293,1,10,Pip Pirrip,"Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty."
294,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oh!
295,1,10,Satan,"Fight, dammit!"
296,1,10,Jesus Christ,Oow! [Satan pick him up] Ooooooh!
297,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [The round ends.] You've got to fight, Jesus."
298,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook."
299,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you."
300,1,10,Jesus Christ,It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
301,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him.] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!"
302,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Uuuuh. Stan?
303,1,10,Stan Marsh,Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
304,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Stan.
305,1,10,Stan Marsh,She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
306,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Stan!
307,1,10,Stan Marsh,[Turning to Kyle.] What?
308,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second."
309,1,10,Stan Marsh,[Thinks a moment.] ... Really?
310,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude!"
311,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks."
312,1,10,Stan Marsh,"You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'."
313,1,10,Jesus Christ,... Who said that?
314,1,10,Stan Marsh,"You did, Jesus."
315,1,10,Jesus Christ,"You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys!"
316,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
317,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Nah, I saw it on Star Trek."
318,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Hmmm.
319,1,10,Satan,"Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!"
320,1,10,Jesus Christ,"Okay, pal. You asked for it!"
321,1,10,Satan,"Ooooooh, you got me."
322,1,10,Referee Mills Lane,One... Two... Three...
323,1,10,Jimbo Kern,No way! He barely touched him!
324,1,10,Referee Mills Lane,... Seven... Eight.
325,1,10,Referee Mills Lane,... Nine... Ten. You're out!
326,1,10,Stan Marsh,Our Savior!
327,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Our Savior!
328,1,10,Michael Buffer,"The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!"
329,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!"
330,1,10,Jimbo Kern,Yeah!
331,1,10,Satan,Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?
332,1,10,Satan,"Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!"
333,1,10,Father Maxi,I don't believe this!
334,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, what a mean thing to do!"
335,1,10,Satan,"[Now on the Forum floor.] Farewell, fools!"
336,1,10,Jimbo Kern,"Man, that guy is a jerk."
337,1,10,Stan Marsh,[Over the microphone.] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
338,1,10,Mr Garrison,"Boy, did we get screwed."
339,1,10,Chef,"Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?"
340,1,10,Jesus Christ,Aw heck. [Puts his halo back on.] Do I have a choice?
341,1,10,Jimbo Kern,"Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!"
342,1,10,Jimbo Kern,Ih-it's comin' right for us!
343,1,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny."
344,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
345,1,10,Damien Thorn,"Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you."
346,1,10,Stan Marsh,You're leaving already?
347,1,10,Damien Thorn,I have to. My dad's always on the move.
348,1,10,Stan Marsh,Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
349,1,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
350,1,10,Stan Marsh,Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
351,1,10,Liane Cartman,"More pie, hon?"
352,1,10,Eric Cartman,Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
