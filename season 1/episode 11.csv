0,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day."
1,1,11,Stan Marsh,I know.
2,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
3,1,11,Stan Marsh,"I can't afford a cruise, dude."
4,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise."
5,1,11,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman!"
6,1,11,Eric Cartman,[still laughing] That is so-ho lame!
7,1,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh man, I..."
8,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
9,1,11,Eric Cartman,"Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time."
10,1,11,Principal Victoria,"[Rushing in.] Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery."
11,1,11,Principal Victoria,So you're going to have a substitute teacher.
12,1,11,Principal Victoria,And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.
13,1,11,Principal Victoria,"Yes, little boy?"
14,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
15,1,11,Principal Victoria,"...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen."
16,1,11,Ms Ellen,"[Brightly.] Hello, children."
17,1,11,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
18,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa!
19,1,11,Eric Cartman,"[Slowly.] Wow, she's pretty."
20,1,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
21,1,11,Stan Marsh,You can say that again.
22,1,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)"
23,1,11,Principal Victoria,"Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay."
24,1,11,Ms Ellen,Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.
25,1,11,Ms Ellen,"Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,"
26,1,11,Ms Ellen,...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us.
27,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,[Gasps.] Stan? Stan?!
28,1,11,Ms Ellen,"Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?"
29,1,11,Eric Cartman,"[Brightly.] Yes, ma'am."
30,1,11,Ms Ellen,Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
31,1,11,Stan Marsh,Yeu-bluuuch.
32,1,11,Ms Ellen,"[A moment later.] Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?"
33,1,11,Eric Cartman,"Noh, he always pukes when he's in love."
34,1,11,Stan Marsh,"I'll kick your ass, Cartman!"
35,1,11,Ms Ellen,So you're alright?
36,1,11,Stan Marsh,Bluuuch.
37,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!"
38,1,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes."
39,1,11,Tom,"You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want."
40,1,11,Mr Garrison,Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?
41,1,11,Mr Hat,"It sure is, Mr. Garrison!"
42,1,11,Tom,"Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this."
43,1,11,Mr Garrison,Hmmm.
44,1,11,Tom,"Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this."
45,1,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that's not bad."
46,1,11,Tom,"Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this."
47,1,11,Mr Garrison,WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
48,1,11,Tom,Alright-y then.
49,1,11,Tom,"Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food."
50,1,11,Mr Garrison,I can live with that.
51,1,11,Tom,"[Excitedly.] Alrighty then, let's get started!"
52,1,11,Eric Cartman,"She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!"
53,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she help but look at you!"
54,1,11,Stan Marsh,You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
55,1,11,Eric Cartman,Until you puked on her.
56,1,11,Chef,"[Approaching.] Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?"
57,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!"
58,1,11,Chef,Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
59,1,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that one!"
60,1,11,Chef,Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
61,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"[Approaching.] Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?"
62,1,11,Stan Marsh,No.
63,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,Well it is!
64,1,11,Chef,That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
65,1,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)"
66,1,11,Chef,Thaat's right!
67,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?"
68,1,11,Chef,That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...
69,1,11,Wendy Testaburger,"[Panicking a little.] Stan? We're still Valentines, right?"
70,1,11,Stan Marsh,"Sure, Wendy, whatever."
71,1,11,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents
72,1,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
73,1,11,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners"
74,1,11,Female singer,"I remember when we were still in love
The moments that we shared were timeless.
Saw it in the wind, knew it in a glance,
the songs we sang were simple reminders."
