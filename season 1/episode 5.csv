0,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?"
1,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere."
2,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Your sister beat you up again, huh?"
3,1,5,Stan Marsh,No!
4,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass."
5,1,5,Stan Marsh,She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.
6,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan."
7,1,5,Eric Cartman,"I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"""
8,1,5,Stan Marsh,"My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!"
9,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Be a man Stan. Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."""
10,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?"
11,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,You mean this one?
12,1,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
13,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,He's my new pet elephant.
14,1,5,Stan Marsh,Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?
15,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three."
16,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Wow, that's cool!"
17,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch."
18,1,5,Eric Cartman,That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
19,1,5,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)"
20,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants."
21,1,5,Ms Crabtree,Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?
22,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid."
23,1,5,Ms Crabtree,Ohâ€”I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.
24,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya."
25,1,5,Eric Cartman,"[Entering.] If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-"""
26,1,5,Ms Crabtree,SIT DOWN KID!!!
27,1,5,Eric Cartman,[Stung.] Yes ma'am.
28,1,5,Mr Garrison,"And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering."
29,1,5,Mr Hat,"That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better."
30,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Garrison?
31,1,5,Mr Garrison,Yes Kyle.
32,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?"
33,1,5,Mr Garrison,"Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes."
34,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.
35,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs."
36,1,5,Stan Marsh,That'd be cool!
37,1,5,Bebe Stevens,I want a pot-bellied elephant.
38,1,5,Pip Pirrip,"Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one."
39,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,That's stupid.
40,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want."
41,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig."
42,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,I'll bet you can't.
43,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,Watch me plebeian.
44,1,5,Mr Garrison,"Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war."
45,1,5,Mr Hat,"Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people."
46,1,5,Mr Garrison,"You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month."
47,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!
48,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Wait, wait. We still need a pig."
49,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,We can use Cartman's pig.
50,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!"
51,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood."
52,1,5,Eric Cartman,"You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!"
53,1,5,Mr Garrison,"Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?"
54,1,5,Stan Marsh,Okay.
55,1,5,Mr Garrison,I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?
56,1,5,Stan Marsh,[Despondantly.] Yes...
57,1,5,Mr Garrison,"Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it."
58,1,5,Mr Hat,"I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?"
59,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, neither. It's my sister."
60,1,5,Mr Garrison,"[Indignantly.] Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!"
61,1,5,Jesus Christ,Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions...
62,1,5,Shelly Marsh,Hey!
63,1,5,Robert,"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
64,1,5,Jesus Christ,"Yes, my son."
65,1,5,Stan Marsh,Hi Shelly.
66,1,5,Shelly Marsh,Are you looking at my headgear?
67,1,5,Stan Marsh,Headgear? What headgear?
68,1,5,Shelly Marsh,Are you looking at my headgear?
69,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice."
70,1,5,Shelly Marsh,You little liar.
71,1,5,Stan Marsh,"No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!"
72,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ready to go Stan?
73,1,5,Stan Marsh,Go where?
74,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
75,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
76,1,5,Eric Cartman,Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
77,1,5,Shelly Marsh,I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
78,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
79,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"""
80,1,5,Shelly Marsh,Who said that?
81,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,This must be it.
82,1,5,Eric Cartman,"[A bit wary.] Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time."
83,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together."
84,1,5,Eric Cartman,"It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you."
85,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,It's just a stupid pig.
86,1,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, quit being such a baby."
87,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!"
88,1,5,Stan Marsh,At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!
89,1,5,Eric Cartman,Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
90,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!"
91,1,5,Eric Cartman,Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
92,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!"
93,1,5,Eric Cartman,I'll kick you in the nuts!
94,1,5,Dr Alphonse Mephesto,Can I help you?
95,1,5,Kenny McCormick,Mmmmmm!
96,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
97,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs."
98,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets."
99,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in."
100,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
101,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you."
102,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses."
103,1,5,Monkey,Mhhh.
104,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,How does that make the world better?
105,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose."
106,1,5,Stan Marsh,Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
107,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish."
108,1,5,Eric Cartman,"Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings."
109,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard."
110,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?"
111,1,5,Terrance Mephesto,"Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?"
112,1,5,Kyle Broflovski,Which song is that?
