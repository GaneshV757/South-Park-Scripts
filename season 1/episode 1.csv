1,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again."
2,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Zeeponaner.
3,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, you can't come to school with me. [Ike Chortles.]"
4,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, go home you little dildo!"
5,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!"
6,1,1,Stan Marsh,What's a dildo?
7,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I don't know...[He faces Cartman and points at him.] and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!"
8,1,1,Eric Cartman,I know what it means!
9,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what?"
10,1,1,Eric Cartman,I'm not telling you.
11,1,1,Stan Marsh,"What's a dildo, Kenny?"
12,1,1,Kenny McCormick,(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina.) [The others laugh.]
13,1,1,Eric Cartman,"He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right! [Kyle swings Ike by his feet, knocking Cartman down.] Ow! [Ike Laughs.]"
14,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that kicks ass!"
15,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby!"
16,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Don't kick the baby.
17,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Kick the baby.
18,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night."
19,1,1,Eric Cartman,That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
20,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Really? What about?
21,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed..."
22,1,1,Eric Cartman,"...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room."
23,1,1,Eric Cartman,Then slowly my bedroom door began to open... [A Visitor peeks inside.]
24,1,1,Eric Cartman,"...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway."
25,1,1,Eric Cartman,Weeaak!
26,1,1,Eric Cartman,Then I was lying on a table...
27,1,1,Eric Cartman,...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
28,1,1,Stan Marsh,Dude! Visitors!
29,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Totally!
30,1,1,Eric Cartman,What?
31,1,1,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were Visitors!"
32,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, it was just a dream, my mom said so."
33,1,1,Stan Marsh,Visitors are real.
34,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows."
35,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working."
36,1,1,Chef,"[Drives up and gets out of the car.] Hello there, children."
37,1,1,Boys,"Hey, Chef."
38,1,1,Stan Marsh,"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?"
39,1,1,Chef,"Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley."
40,1,1,Eric Cartman,Kick ass.
41,1,1,Chef,"Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?"
42,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Surprised.] Huh?
43,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fat boy saw it!"
44,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!"
45,1,1,Chef,"Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?"
46,1,1,Eric Cartman,Oh!
47,1,1,Stan Marsh,They took him on their ship.
48,1,1,Chef,Oh! [Quietly.] Did they give you an anal probe?
49,1,1,Eric Cartman,Oh!
50,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,What's an anal probe?
51,1,1,Chef,That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt.
52,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
53,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?"
54,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!"
55,1,1,Eric Cartman,No!
56,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Eneh probe.
57,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, dildo!"
58,1,1,Chef,"Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control."
59,1,1,Eric Cartman,Oh!
60,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
61,1,1,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!"
62,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why you walkin' so funny Cartman?
63,1,1,Eric Cartman,Shut up!

69,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Kick the baby!
70,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Good morning, Miss Crabtree."
71,1,1,Ms Veronica Crabtree,Sit down! We're runnin' late!
72,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn it, he's still there."
73,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, don't worry about him."
74,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me."
75,1,1,Ms Crabtree,Sit down back there! Arrrggghhh!!
76,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch."
77,1,1,Ms Crabtree,What did you say!?
78,1,1,Stan Marsh,I said I have a bad itch.
79,1,1,Ms Crabtree,Oh.
80,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[Gasps.] Oh, my God!"
81,1,1,Stan Marsh,[Turning to see.] Visitors!
82,1,1,Kenny McCormick,(Oh nooo!)
83,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike! [Kyle runs to the front of the bus.] Stop the bus! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!"
84,1,1,Ms Crabtree,Do you want an office referral!?
85,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,No.
86,1,1,Ms Crabtree,Then sit down!
87,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,But I...

92,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?"
93,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up you guys, it's not working."
94,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,We have to do something!
95,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us."
96,1,1,Ms Crabtree,What did you say!?
97,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce."
98,1,1,Ms Crabtree,"Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do."
99,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Stan farts.] You farted. [They laugh.]
100,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Heh, somebody's baking brownies."
101,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,That's the third cow this month. At this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through.
102,1,1,Officer Barbrady,This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time.
103,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,People been saying they've been seeing UFO's around.
104,1,1,Officer Barbrady,UFO's? [Laughs.]
105,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,"Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks."
106,1,1,Officer Barbrady,That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
107,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,What was that?
108,1,1,Officer Barbrady,"That, that was a pigeon."
109,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,"What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one?"
110,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,Hey! My cattle!
111,1,1,Farmer Carl Denkins,You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on!
112,1,1,Officer Barbrady,There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
113,1,1,Mr Herbert Garrison,"And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus."
114,1,1,Mr Hat,"That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492 Columbus started a restaurant...[He is drowned out by Kyle's voice.]"
115,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[Whispering.] Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, ""Where's your brother, Kyle?"" ""You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"""
116,1,1,Stan Marsh,"[Whispering.] Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him."
117,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[His voice is rising to an audible level.] ""You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!"" ""Brush and floss, Kyle!"" ""Where has that finger been, Kyle?"""
118,1,1,Stan Marsh,Dude!
119,1,1,Mr Garrison,"Is there a problem, boys?"
120,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now."
121,1,1,Mr Garrison,"Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?"
122,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Silence.] It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe."
123,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Embarrassed.] Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh."
124,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[Kyle walks up to Mr. Garrison's desk.] Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?"
125,1,1,Mr Garrison,"I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?"
126,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!"
127,1,1,Mr Garrison,Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
128,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?"
129,1,1,Mr Hat,"Well, Kyle, no!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!"
130,1,1,Mr Garrison,"Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle."
131,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it!
132,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you."
133,1,1,Eric Cartman,Ow! My ass!
134,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Dude!
135,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Damn, Cartman!"
136,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Cartman farts fire again.] Uh... Ow! My ass!
137,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he's farting fire!"
138,1,1,Stan Marsh,It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
139,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, that was just a dream."
140,1,1,Mr Garrison,"Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?"
141,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine."
142,1,1,Train Conductor,"Hey, you cows can't get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? 'Cause you're cows."
143,1,1,Train Conductor,"No, no, no. Don't try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? 'Cause it's not gonna work."
144,1,1,Officer Barbrady,"[Drives by with his lights flashing.] Hold it right there, cows!"
145,1,1,Officer Barbrady,Come back here! Now then! [He pursues them.]
146,1,1,A Kid,"So then I had bad, bad gas."
147,1,1,Jason White,"Ya, seriously, killer."
148,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Cartman farts fire.] Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry."
149,1,1,Stan Marsh,How can you eat when you're farting fire?
150,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature."
151,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger."
152,1,1,Stan Marsh,[Gasps.] Where?
153,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Singing.] Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger.
154,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!"
155,1,1,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
156,1,1,Stan Marsh,I do not!
157,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, guys."
158,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi, Wendy."
159,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Hi, Wendy."
160,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Here, Stan. This is for you. [Wendy hands Stan a note.]"
161,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
162,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww! [She leaves.]
163,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[Their eyes follow her out.] Bye, Wendy."
164,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Their eyes follow her out.] Bye, Wendy."
165,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what does the note say?"
166,1,1,Stan Marsh,[He glances at it.] Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.
167,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
168,1,1,Eric Cartman,Or slip her the tongue.
169,1,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)"
170,1,1,Stan Marsh,[That gets his attention.] What? How do you know she has a cat?
171,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back."
172,1,1,Chef,"Hello there, children."
173,1,1,Boys,"Hey, Chef."
174,1,1,Chef,How are you doing?
175,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Bad.
176,1,1,Chef,Why bad?
177,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?"
178,1,1,Chef,"Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.

I'm gonna make love to you woman
Gonna lay you down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make you moan and perspire
Gonna--"
179,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Chef."
180,1,1,Chef,--get those juices flowin'--
181,1,1,Stan Marsh,Chef.
182,1,1,Chef,--we're makin' love gravy--
183,1,1,Stan Marsh,Chef!
184,1,1,Chef,"--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!"
185,1,1,Stan Marsh,Chef!!
186,1,1,Chef,"Love luh--

 Huh?"
187,1,1,Chef,Do you feel better?
188,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,No!
189,1,1,Chef,"Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day."
190,1,1,Stan Marsh,Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
191,1,1,Chef,What?!
192,1,1,Chef,"What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!"
193,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
194,1,1,Eric Cartman,You are making it up.
195,1,1,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
196,1,1,Eric Cartman,What?
197,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,That was cool!
198,1,1,Chef,"It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device."
199,1,1,Chef,This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us.
200,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Turning to face Chef, testily.] Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?"
201,1,1,Chef,"It's no joke, children, this is big!"
202,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me."
203,1,1,Chef,"Uuh, hold on now, hold on now. [To himself.] Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children."
204,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!"
205,1,1,Chef,"[Pulling on the fire alarm] Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out! [To the boys.] Okay children, this is your chance!"
206,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Killer! Thanks, Chef."
207,1,1,Chef,"Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready."
208,1,1,Boys,"[Singing.]
 We got out of school,
No more school today,
We got out of school..."
209,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!"
210,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now."
211,1,1,Eric Cartman,"I would if I could, you son of a bitch!"
212,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?"
213,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!"
214,1,1,Eric Cartman,"I love to singa,
About the moona and June-a and the springa,
I love to singa,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
215,1,1,Stan Marsh,What the hell was that?
216,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors!
217,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Ah, son of a bitch!"
218,1,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control."
219,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Hey!
220,1,1,Eric Cartman,Uh...
221,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,If you Visitors can hear me-
222,1,1,Eric Cartman,Hey...
223,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!"
224,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Ow! [Faces Kyle.] That hurts, you buttlicker!"
225,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, look! It's them."
226,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Give me back my brother!
227,1,1,Stan Marsh,Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
228,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!
229,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn it, we were so close!"
230,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey look, [Kenny gets up.] I think Kenny's okay."
231,1,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!)"
232,1,1,Stan Marsh,Owww.
233,1,1,Kenny McCormick,"[He gets up again.] (Nope, I'm all fine. Agh!)"
234,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Wow, poor Kenny."
235,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Now do you believe us, Cartman?"
236,1,1,Eric Cartman,No!
237,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, they killed Kenny!"
238,1,1,Eric Cartman,He's not dead.
239,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Kenny is dead!"
240,1,1,Stan Marsh,See?
241,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, you guys."
242,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"He's dead, Cartman!"
243,1,1,Eric Cartman,"God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe! [He walks off.] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home."
244,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Go on and go home, you fat chicken!"
245,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Off screen.] Dildo!
246,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You're all I have left, Stan."
247,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger."
248,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!"
249,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. [He hurries away.]"
250,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Rats.
251,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Hello, Eric."
252,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Hi, Mom."
253,1,1,Liane Cartman,How are you doing?
254,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!"
255,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise."
256,1,1,Eric Cartman,I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
257,1,1,Liane Cartman,"You're not fat, you're big boned."
258,1,1,Eric Cartman,That's what I said.
259,1,1,Liane Cartman,"You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?"
260,1,1,Eric Cartman,No!
261,1,1,Liane Cartman,Just a weensy eensy woo woo?
262,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, leave me alone mom! [He walks past her.]"
263,1,1,Liane Cartman,"How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?"
264,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[He stops in his tracks.] What? Well, that does sound pretty good."
265,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Uh, Mom?"
266,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Yes, hon?"
267,1,1,Eric Cartman,"If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?"
268,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?"
269,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs."
270,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now."
271,1,1,Stan Marsh,But her note said she'd be here.
272,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, Stan."
273,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
274,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww!
275,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do."
276,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"But why, Stan?"
277,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
278,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww!
279,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?"
280,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,[Turns to Kyle.] Huh?
281,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Just make sweet love down by the fire.
282,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,What happened to your little brother?
283,1,1,News Reporter,"As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns."
284,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck."
285,1,1,News Reporter,"Could it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth?"
286,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
287,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie."
288,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
289,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!"
290,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
291,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!"
292,1,1,Eric Cartman,Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
293,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight."
294,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Confused.] What?
295,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
296,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?"
297,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
298,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back."
299,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. [He moves out.]"
300,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Come on, Stan. [She walks past him, following Kyle.]"
301,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
302,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww! [She walks away.]
303,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?"
304,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
305,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have any!"
306,1,1,Mr Kitty,Meow.
307,1,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!"
308,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty."
309,1,1,Liane Cartman,"Eric, look who's here."
310,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, weak mom."
311,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop."
312,1,1,Eric Cartman,"I can't, my mom said..."
313,1,1,Liane Cartman,"That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends."
314,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Quietly.] But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--"
315,1,1,Liane Cartman,"[Stern.] Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow."
316,1,1,Eric Cartman,God damn it!
317,1,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I have to get home."
318,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again."
319,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks."
320,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,How come the Visitors aren't coming for him?
321,1,1,Stan Marsh,I think we have to signal them somehow.
322,1,1,Eric Cartman,[Cartman farts fire.] Ow!
323,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, he's like Rudolph."
324,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come!"
325,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight."
326,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Sure you do!
327,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on Cartman, fart!"
328,1,1,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna.
329,1,1,Stan Marsh,[To Kyle and Wendy.] He can't hold it in forever.
330,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Fart, damn you!"
331,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!"
332,1,1,Eric Cartman,I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
333,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, it's happening again."
334,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, look at that."
335,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Now, do you believe us, Cartman?"
336,1,1,Eric Cartman,You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
337,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!"
338,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Sure, you guys, what-ever."
339,1,1,Chef,"Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom! [He looks at his watch.] And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on."
340,1,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!"
341,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God damn it!"
342,1,1,Mr Garrison,"[Driving by, he stops.] What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town."
343,1,1,Mr Hat,"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
344,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come down here, you stinking aliens! [Three Visitors appear.] Uh, uh..."
345,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back."
346,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing."
347,1,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
348,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again."
349,1,1,Stan Marsh,"That was beautiful, dude."
350,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Did it work?
351,1,1,Stan Marsh,"No, they're leaving."
352,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, you scrawny-assed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!"
353,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude!"
354,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
355,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey Wendy, what's a fuck? [She shrugs.]"
356,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Help me doy tair.
357,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!"
358,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Don't hurt me.
359,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo... Moo...Moo...Moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)"
360,1,1,Cows,Moo?? (Really??)
361,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!"
362,1,1,Ike Broflovski,Don't kick the baby.
363,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)"
364,1,1,Eric Cartman,What the hell are they talking about?
365,1,1,Cow,Moo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?)
366,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.)"
367,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo...moo...moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)"
368,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Ike!
369,1,1,Carl the Visitor,Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)
370,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
371,1,1,Ike Broflovski,It's my turn!
372,1,1,Carl the Visitor,"Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)"
373,1,1,Eric Cartman,"You guys, get me down from here!"
374,1,1,Eric Cartman,Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
375,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with."
376,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike."
377,1,1,Ike Broflovski,"Oh, he fly out the sky."
378,1,1,Chef,"Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back!"
379,1,1,Blonde woman,"Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us."
380,1,1,Chef,"Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in."
381,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. [They leave.]"
382,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Thanks for your help, Wendy."
383,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Whatever, dude."
384,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Hey, I didn't throw up."
385,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Cool!
386,1,1,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
387,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,Eww!
388,1,1,Stan Marsh,Sorry.
389,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, look. A French fry."
390,1,1,Stan Marsh,Cool.
391,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,And what is that?
392,1,1,Stan Marsh,I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
393,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, what's that?"
394,1,1,Stan Marsh,"That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago."
395,1,1,Wendy Testaburger,"Oh hey, what about that?"
396,1,1,Stan Marsh,I don't know what the hell that is...
397,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around."
398,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we're running out of friends."
399,1,1,Stan Marsh,I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.
400,1,1,Cows,Mooo.
401,1,1,Officer Barbrady,Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now.
402,1,1,Officer Barbrady,"I love to sing-a,
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a,
I love to sing-a,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a..."
403,1,1,Eric Cartman,Puh!
404,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hey Cartman."
405,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school."
406,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night."
407,1,1,Stan Marsh,"Really, what about?"
408,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye."
409,1,1,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened."
410,1,1,Eric Cartman,"[Sarcastically.] Oh right, [Matter of factly.] why don't I have pinkeye then?"
411,1,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you do have pinkeye!"
412,1,1,Eric Cartman,"Ahh, son of a bitch!"
