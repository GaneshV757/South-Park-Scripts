0,10,9,Mrs Garrison,"And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like- [the door opens and Mr. Mackey enters the classroom, looking quite pissed. Mr. Mackey walks by Mrs. Garrison without saying a word] Oh hello, Mr. Mackey."
1,10,9,Mr Mackey,"[faces the class] All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay? [the girls leave their seats and go into the hall] Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! [Mrs. Garrison's jaw drops at the behavior, then she gets concerned. The boys just blink at Mr. Mackey]"
2,10,9,Butters Stotch,What's a urinal?
3,10,9,Stan Marsh,A wall toilet for peeing in.
4,10,9,Mr Mackey,"And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!"
5,10,9,Jimmy,Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
6,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11."
7,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!"
8,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?"
9,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?! [the boys just laugh] Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!"
10,10,9,Officer 1,"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on."
11,10,9,Mr Mackey,But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
12,10,9,Officer 1,But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
13,10,9,Narrator,The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in: [the cover of book 37 is shown] The Mystery of the Urinal Turd.
14,10,9,Officer 1,"So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime."
15,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",That sure is a mystery.
16,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Yeah, it sounds super-hard."
17,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.
18,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",F-really?
19,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now."
20,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",[turns to Frank] Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.
21,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",My clue is kind of pointing this way.
22,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","[moves to his left, to where Frank's clue is pointing] Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue."
23,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",I've still got a raging clue.
24,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",[turns right] My clue's pointing over there now!
25,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Oh, let's follow that clue! [move off to the right and away from the boys' room.]"
26,10,9,Stan Marsh,Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
27,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Not yet.
28,10,9,Eric Cartman,"They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again."
29,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Will you shut up about 9/11!
30,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!"
31,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
32,10,9,Eric Cartman,Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
33,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
34,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, at least one-fourth."
35,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth."
36,10,9,Eric Cartman,"...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! [sees Butters walking towards the group]"
37,10,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey, fellas!"
38,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?"
39,10,9,Butters Stotch,"Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush."
40,10,9,Eric Cartman,Aha! Do you see?
41,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where did you hear that?
42,10,9,Butters Stotch,[points] From Eric.
43,10,9,Eric Cartman,I rest my case.
44,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up and stands next to Butters] Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?"
45,10,9,Butters Stotch,"Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11."
46,10,9,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Butters."
47,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?"
48,10,9,Eric Cartman,What? People see the truth?
49,10,9,Butters Stotch,Can I go now?
50,10,9,Eric Cartman,You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media! [begins to move away from the boys] I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! [goes around a corner and disappears]
51,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rolls his eyes] Oh no...
52,10,9,Eric Cartman,"It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?[He's back at his computer once more and clicks on his mouse]Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?"
53,10,9,Leroy,"This is my frog.  He doesn't have a name. He's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets. [he gets a smattering of applause from the other kids, then goes back to his seat]"
54,10,9,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?"
55,10,9,Eric Cartman,"[raises and waves his hand] Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!"
56,10,9,Mrs Garrison,"All right, Eric, you can go next."
57,10,9,Eric Cartman,[leaves his seat and goes to the front of the class with his laptop.] For Show and Tell today I have brought... [puts on some glasses] ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!.. [removes the glasses for dramatic effect] behind the 9/11 attacks! [the lights go out and a projector is turned on]
58,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rolls his eyes] Oh Christ...
59,10,9,Eric Cartman,"[his first image is that of the Twin Towers] We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers, [the image gets animated as a cross-section of a wall is picked apart and the steel girders shown, which led to their collapse.] which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel? [the other kids look at each other. Kyle's eyes are half-closed, showing his disinterest] We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well, [a picture of the Pentagon with the damage clearly visible. A helicopter hovers nearby] but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?"
60,10,9,Clyde Donovan,Whoa...
61,10,9,Eric Cartman,"So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? [he begins to use his fingers to show the numbers as he says them] Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. [click. Kyle now appears superimposed on the 9/11 picture already onscreen]. Kyle!"
62,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Me??!
63,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! [clicks, and another shot of the Twin Towers is shown] When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, [he zooms in on the picture, which just becomes pixilated] but when I computer-enhanced it, [the pixilation disappears as the picture sharpens - it's a drawing of an evil Kyle with a large, sharp knife in his right hand] You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole."
64,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Token. [Token does not respond, but just watches him walk by. Kyle stops by Butters and Craig] You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? [Butters is suddenly scared]"
65,10,9,Butters Stotch,Waaaah! [drops his book and runs away. The other kids just stare at Kyle]
66,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11! [the other kids move away quickly] God-damnit!"
67,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Hello bubbe, how was school today?"
68,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops in front of Sheila, to her left] Terrible."
69,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad."
70,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11."
71,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat?!
72,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
73,10,9,Principal Victoria,"Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened."
74,10,9,Skeeter,"Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth."
75,10,9,Other men,"Oh no, oh brother, oh God."
76,10,9,Mr Adler,[stands up] That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
77,10,9,Other men,"Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded."
78,10,9,Mr Mackey,"[stands up] Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!"
79,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!"
80,10,9,Mr Mackey,"More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!"
81,10,9,Jimbo Kern,He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
82,10,9,Mr Mackey,"No, I'm not saying they're related!"
83,10,9,Randy Marsh,[rises] How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! [makes a fist]
84,10,9,Skeeter,"It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!"
85,10,9,Richard Tweak,Who else could it have been?
86,10,9,Det Yates,This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
87,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Oh no, not the Goddamned-"
88,10,9,Narrator,The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in: [the cover of a new book is shown] The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy.
89,10,9,Det Yates,"So that's about the long and short of it, Hardly Boys. There were two towers that stood right here, [shows off the question mark] and they're gone."
90,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",And nobody knows who's responsible?
91,10,9,Det Yates,"There are theories, but, nobody's certain."
92,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?"
93,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue."
94,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Really?
95,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue."
96,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now."
97,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Mine's pointing to the left.
98,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it."
99,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Okay, let's follow your raging clue."
100,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Oofff.
101,10,9,Randy Marsh,[watches them walk away] Godspeed.
102,10,9,Stan Marsh,[appears suddenly in the living room] Kyle!
103,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[jumps] Aaaah!
104,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys [looks around] are coming to my house and questioning me about you??"
105,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there."
106,10,9,Stan Marsh,Well why did you have to involve me??
107,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's not my fault.
108,10,9,Stan Marsh,"All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11."
109,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
110,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you. [moves off, then stops and turns around] There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?"
111,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,......Dude.
112,10,9,Stan Marsh,[mulls it over] That's all I needed. [turns around and heads for the back door. Kyle follows.]
113,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela [walks up to a school janitor, who's a Latino with mop and bucket in hand], the school janitor. Okay? [the fourth graders are shown with some kindergartners in front of them] He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face! [the sixth graders are shown seated to the left of the fourth graders] So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head! [the kids laugh] Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!"
114,10,9,Mrs Garrison,Mr. Mackey! [he and Principal Victoria enter the gym] We got him.
115,10,9,Mr Mackey,Huh?
116,10,9,Mrs Garrison,We caught the person that did it.
117,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11."
118,10,9,Man from 911truth.org,"[wearing a 911truth.org T-shirt] Aw geez. Come on in, kids. [the boys enter. A model of the towers stands on the coffee table while the computer displays a 9/11 Web page. The rest of the office is littered with 9/11 stuff] It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day."
119,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,They are?
120,10,9,911truth Man,"Yeah, it a way of keeping people from seeing the real evidence. I know it seems crazy, but 9/11 was pulled off by our own government, so they could gain support for attacking the Middle East."
121,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,What? No no no.
122,10,9,911truth Man,I know it's hard to believe.
123,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?"
124,10,9,911truth Man,It's called the False Flag policy. Make it look like the enemy attacked you. Get all your citizens riled up and waving American flags. Then you're free to invade any country you want.
125,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,...That's retarded.
126,10,9,911truth Man,[sits at his computer and starts typing away] Look into the evidence of 9/11 and you'll see there are a lot of holes in their story.
127,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
128,10,9,911truth Man,"You don't understand! The government controls everything. The media, the corporations, they have the power to do anything they want. Here, look! [grabs two large glass jars and hands them to Kyle] Read the labels on these! Go on, read them!"
129,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[reads the labels] Code 234
130,10,9,911truth Man,We think they came from a government office.
131,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,What is it?
132,10,9,911truth Man,It's anthrax.
133,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Anthrax?!
134,10,9,911truth Man,Someday we'll use it as evidence against them.
135,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob! [at that moment the house is raided by Chicago cops. The doors and windows fall away as they rush inside. An ambulance and a lot of police cars wait outside as a helicopter hovers overhead. Kyle stands with the jars of anthrax, sure that he's in big trouble] Aw, aw, awww!"
136,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?"
137,10,9,Clyde Donovan,"I don't know. [looks away as Mr. Mackey gets up, walks around the desk, and stands behind him, to his left]"
138,10,9,Mr Mackey,"You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room. [walks behind Clyde to the right side. Clyde looks away and to the left] Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at! [Clyde tries hard to contain his laughter] Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! [Clyde grins, then bursts out laughing. The door opens and Principal Victoria looks in]"
139,10,9,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here."
140,10,9,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, that's good! [Principal Victoria walks away. Mr. Mackey addresses Clyde again] Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade! [The Donovans show up] Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!"
141,10,9,Mr Donovan,"Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know..."
142,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding."
143,10,9,Donald Rumsfeld,"Come on in, Mr. President. [President Bush comes in through one of the side doors]"
144,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Mr. President, my name is-"
145,10,9,President George Bush,SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything! [walks to his desk] We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging!
146,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[quite surprised] Really?
147,10,9,911truth Man,You won't get away with it! People know!
148,10,9,President George Bush,People? You mean sheeple. We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance. Just one more... leak... [pulls out a pistol and his voice gets sinister] to fix... [the Secret Service agents take the 911truth man to the President]
149,10,9,911truth Man,Wait. What are you doing?
150,10,9,President George Bush,"[leaves his desk and cocks the gun] You've been a thorn in our side for too long, I'm afraid."
151,10,9,911truth Man,No! You can't do this! [Bush grabs him by the collar] Please! I'll stop. I'll take down the Web site. I'll sto- [the President sticks the gun into the man's mouth] Oh no! Oh no!
152,10,9,President George Bush,Too late. [squeezes the trigger once and the bullet goes clear through the man's head. The 911truth man is dead]
153,10,9,Stan Marsh,JESUS CHRIST!!
154,10,9,Donald Rumsfeld,[Condoleezza Rice stands to his left] Hahaha. He died like a pig.
155,10,9,President George Bush,[wipes the blood off his clothes and skin] Some pigs never learn.
156,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[in sheer disbelief, cocks his head right] No. Way."
157,10,9,Stan Marsh,He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
158,10,9,President George Bush,"Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever."
159,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[ever more incredulous, cocks his head left and lower] ...Really??"
160,10,9,Stan Marsh,Why?!
161,10,9,President George Bush,"[smiling, he begins to pace] Oldest reason in the world. Money. The towers fell and the American sheeple all waved their flags. [walks by Dick Cheney, who's got a crossbow and is dressed to hunt] Finally we could invade Iraq, [finishes off with sinister glee] and get the oil which made us all richer than before."
162,10,9,Donald Rumsfeld,"[rubs his hands together greedily] Beauutiful money, hahahaha!"
163,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[cocks his head right and even lower. He's not buying it] ...Really??
164,10,9,Stan Marsh,[off on a different page] Is the whole government in on this?
165,10,9,President George Bush,"We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good-bye, boys. [steps aside as Dick Cheney takes aim at them. Cheney fires an arrow at them, but the arrow hits a marble vase on a table behind the boys. The arrow bounces off the vase and hits fire alarm, which sets off the sprinkler system. Everyone does his best not to get wet]"
166,10,9,Dick Cheney,Dangit! I missed again!
167,10,9,President George Bush,"For Christ's sake, Cheney! [Two aids open the doors to the Oval Office and enter]"
168,10,9,Stan Marsh,[seeing their chance] Kyle! Run! [the boys take off with the Secret Service in hot pursuit]
169,10,9,President George Bush,KILL THEM!
170,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay? [all the kids in the hall listen, then start laughing] Oh you think that's funny, huh?! [Principal Victoria is also snickering in the background] Let me assure you, there is nothing funny... about going up to a nice, clean, unsuspectin' urinal, [next shot is the school gym, where some students are practicing their basketball skills, but now they're listening] 'kay, droppin' your pants then... turnin' around... squattin' over that urinal, 'kay, maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands, m'kay, and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see. [the kids there begin to laugh] Oh yeah, that's real funny! [turns off the mic and slams it down] I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing I DO! M'kay?! [moves off]"
171,10,9,Stan Marsh,"All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude. [next scene is another city, somewhere] We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw."
172,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,It just... doesn't seem right.
173,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time."
174,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. [a door opens besides them and the 911truth man the President had shot exits a restaurant and goes the other direction]"
175,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? [Kyle stops and turns around]"
176,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! [the 911truth man turns around, then panics as he recognizes the boys] Dude. You're alive? [the man stands there for a few seconds, not knowing what to do, then turns around and runs away, pushing people aside. Kyle gives chase] Come back here! [the man keeps running]"
177,10,9,Man 1,Hey!
178,10,9,Man 2,Ogh!
179,10,9,911truth Man,[begins to plead] No. Please. Pleeease!
180,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! What the hell is going on?!
181,10,9,911truth Man,"Don't kill me! I, I just do what they say!"
182,10,9,Stan Marsh,What who said?
183,10,9,911truth Man,I have a family. Please don't kill me!
184,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we aren't going to kill you. [just then a gunshot is heard and the 911truth man falls dead... again]"
185,10,9,Stan Marsh,Oh God!
186,10,9,Bearded Man,"[appears with the smoking gun] It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!"
187,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Who the fuck are you?!
188,10,9,Bearded Man,There's no time! come on! [the camera pans up but stays focused on the three folks as the boys follow the bearded man out of the alley.]
189,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
190,10,9,Stan Marsh,Who are you?
191,10,9,Bearded Man,"[pours himself a drink] I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed."
192,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,You f-figured this thing all out?
193,10,9,Bearded Man,"Not me. My mystery-solving sons. Come on in, boys. [the Hardly Boys enter] My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue."
194,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Gave us both a clue.
195,10,9,Mr Hardly,"That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues."
196,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",I was getting a clue like every two minutes.
197,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.
198,10,9,Mr Hardly,Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.
199,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",It was huuuge.
200,10,9,Mr Hardly,That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.
201,10,9,Stan Marsh,Aw Jesus...
202,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
203,10,9,Mr Hardly,"For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?"
204,10,9,President George Bush,"[off-screen] That's quite enough, Hardly! [the camera shows him entering with his staff] Don't believe what he says, boys; we caused 9/11. [brings forth a manila folder] It's all right here in these secret documents, [hugs the folder tight] but you'll never get them. [turns around as he yawns, dropping the folder to the floor behind him. No one picks it up]"
205,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
206,10,9,President George Bush,"[dropping the act] Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing."
207,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
208,10,9,President George Bush,"We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?"
209,10,9,Mr Hardly,"Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here? [a close-up of Kyle. A gun appears next to his left temple. The camera moves clockwise as it refocuses on Stan, who's got the gun aimed at Kyle. Stan must have told the President]"
210,10,9,Stan Marsh,"How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!"
211,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Stan! What the fuck?!
212,10,9,Stan Marsh,It was all planned out!
213,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,You knew this whole time? Why?
214,10,9,Stan Marsh,Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
215,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[backs away a bit] What??
216,10,9,Stan Marsh,The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
217,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,So you blamed the government?!
218,10,9,Mr Hardly,"And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11!"
219,10,9,Stan Marsh,"[lowers his pistol] Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?"
220,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?"
221,10,9,Stan Marsh,Yuh.
222,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"So then, who was responsible for 9/11?"
223,10,9,Stan Marsh,Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
224,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","[giggles] Yeah. What are you, retarded? [The President and his staff laugh heartily]"
225,10,9,Mr Hardly,"Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!"
226,10,9,Mr Mackey,"When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay! [Stan squirts some cleaning fluid onto the urinal basin] How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face? [Stan laughs] Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!"
