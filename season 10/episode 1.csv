0,10,1,Stan Marsh,"You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. [the others look up at him]"
1,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Going away? For how long?
2,10,1,Stan Marsh,Forever.
3,10,1,Chef,I'm sorry boys.
4,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. [Chef opens a pamphlet about the club]"
5,10,1,Chef,Wow!
6,10,1,Mrs Garrison,Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!
7,10,1,Chef,What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
8,10,1,Mrs Garrison,I hope you're making the right choice.
9,10,1,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna miss him. [Butters walks forward a few steps and puts his hand on the sofa] I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! [turns his head left and cries into his left arm]
10,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. [Kyle draws close and hugs him]"
11,10,1,Mayor McDaniels,"And we will all miss you, Chef, [Chef watches from a nearby table] but we know you must do what your heart tells you.."
12,10,1,Jimbo Kern,Bye-bye!
13,10,1,Gerald Broflovski,Good-bye!
14,10,1,Mr Mackey,So long!
15,10,1,A Man,"So long, Chef!"
16,10,1,A Sign Holder,"Good-bye, Chef!"
17,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!"
18,10,1,Chef,[waves] Good-bye! [goes into the plane and disappears from the door. The door closes and the plane taxis away. The town waves good-bye to Chef again and Cartman bawls uncontrollably in a high-pitched voice. The plane climbs into the sky]..
19,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Draw two card, fatass."
20,10,1,Eric Cartman,"[draws two and puts one down] Reverse to you, Jew. [the doorbell rings]"
21,10,1,Stan Marsh,[irritable] I'll get it. [rises and walks over. He opens the door...]
22,10,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
23,10,1,Stan Marsh,He's back!
24,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
25,10,1,Eric Cartman,All right! [applause comes out of nowhere. Chef gives them a group hug]
26,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Chef! I can't believe you're back!
27,10,1,Chef,"Well, it's true."
28,10,1,Stan Marsh,But are you back for good?
29,10,1,Chef,That's right.
30,10,1,Mrs Garrison,Hey everybody! Chef's back!
31,10,1,Townsfolk and Bar Patrons,What? All right! Yeah! [they clear the bar to meet Chef]
32,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh, finally! [prances away gleefully after the others]"
33,10,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people."
34,10,1,Chef,Yeah!
35,10,1,Mrs Garrison,"But now that you're back here, does that mean that you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore?"
36,10,1,Chef,N-no! No.
37,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?"
38,10,1,Chef,That's right.
39,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply. [catches his breath] Right?"
40,10,1,Chef,"That's right, Randy! [everyone laughs approvingly]"
41,10,1,Jimbo Kern,"Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house."
42,10,1,Chef,"Thank you, Jimbo."
43,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in."
44,10,1,Chef,That's right! Thank you. Good-bye everybody.
45,10,1,Townsfolk and Bar Patrons,Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye
46,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef."
47,10,1,Chef,"You bet! Good-bye, children! [the boys are puzzled at the way he's replying to them. It sounds choppy.]"
48,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Right. Uh, see ya."
49,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?"
50,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[stops. The others stop too. Stan looks up] Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little."
51,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
52,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[turns left and cross the street. The others follow] Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good."
53,10,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, me too.)"
54,10,1,A Boy,"[at one of the tables] It's really weird what he said. I don't know, it kind of confused me."
55,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again."
56,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! [a distraught Clyde walks by and stops.]
57,10,1,Clyde Donovan,"You guys, you guys."
58,10,1,Stan Marsh,What?
59,10,1,Clyde Donovan,Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
60,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Like what?
61,10,1,Clyde Donovan,I think... [glances at his food] I think he wants to have sex with me.
62,10,1,Stan Marsh,What??
63,10,1,Clyde Donovan,I gotta- I gotta go. [turns right and walks off]
64,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Weirdo. [Fosse moves up and gets his lunch; the boys follow him in]
65,10,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
66,10,1,The Boys,Hey Chef.
67,10,1,Chef,How's it goin'?
68,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Good.
69,10,1,Chef,"Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?"
70,10,1,Eric Cartman,[The boys are stunned] Excuse me?
71,10,1,Chef,"Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love."
72,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,...Chef?? A-are you okay?
73,10,1,Chef,"I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle."
74,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are you saying??"
75,10,1,Chef,"I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children."
76,10,1,Stan Marsh,...WHAT??
77,10,1,Det Jarvis,"Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef."
78,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,This doesn't make any sense!
79,10,1,Det Jarvis,We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.
80,10,1,Stan Marsh,"No, he's not."
81,10,1,Det Jarvis,[childish voice] Uh huh.
82,10,1,Stan Marsh,"No, he's not."
83,10,1,Det Jarvis,"[childish voice] Yeah, yeah he is so."
84,10,1,Butters,What's a pedophile?
85,10,1,Det Jarvis,"Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef, [whips out generic plush doll with no features on it] so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here? [points to the genital area]"
86,10,1,Stan Marsh,NO!
87,10,1,Det Jarvis,"Okay, did he touch you here? [moves two fingers over the groin]"
88,10,1,The Class,NO!
89,10,1,Det Jarvis,[sits the doll on his right lap and starts rubbing the doll's nipples] Did he ever do this? How about this? [lifts the doll to his face and wags his tongue over the doll's genital area]
90,10,1,Butters,My Uncle Bud did that to me once! [smiles unwittingly]
91,10,1,Det Jarvis,[gets off the desk and walks around] Did Chef ever try one of these on for size? [places the doll face down on the desk and starts humping it]
92,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!"
93,10,1,Det Jarvis,"[continues humping] Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh."
94,10,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
95,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[the boys look at each other] Chef, the police are asking questions about you!"
96,10,1,Chef,"Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love."
97,10,1,Stan Marsh,"No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!"
98,10,1,Chef,"Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass?"
99,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!"
100,10,1,Chef,"I specialize in your asshole, Kyle. [turns and walks away]"
101,10,1,Eric Cartman,"...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex."
102,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things."
103,10,1,Kenny McCormick,(Like what?)
104,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex."
105,10,1,Stan Marsh,Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
106,10,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah! I think...)
107,10,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
108,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, come on guys!"
109,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. [they step off on the other side and approach the front door. Stan reaches over and pulls the rope that rings the house's bell. A black butler opens up]"
110,10,1,Butler,May I help you.
111,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?"
112,10,1,Butler,Right this way. [the boys enter and the butler leads them to the ]
113,10,1,"Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire","Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-"
114,10,1,Butler,"Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you."
115,10,1,"Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire","Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!"
116,10,1,Club Members,Tally ho!
117,10,1,Mr Connolly,Indeed!
118,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. [the members just look around]"
119,10,1,Mr Connolly,"What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!"
120,10,1,Eric Cartman,...Huh?
121,10,1,Marksman,We travel the world and have sex with children!
122,10,1,Marine,"Yes, what else would we do?"
123,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!"
124,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club! [turns and approaches a world map from maybe two centuries ago] Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit."
125,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,...Dude!
126,10,1,Mr Connolly,"I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!"
127,10,1,Stan Marsh,NO!!
128,10,1,Mr Connolly,No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again? [whips out a portable hypnotizer and makes some whistling sound effects] How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club? [more sound effects]
129,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[unaffected] No! [Mr. Connolly tries harder, even stepping forward...]"
130,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what are you doing?!"
131,10,1,Mr Connolly,"[looks at his machine] Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody. [hides it behind his back] Well, so long then."
132,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Just what the hell is that thing?!
133,10,1,Mr Connolly,What? What thing? I don't see anything.
134,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,HA! I knew it!
135,10,1,Stan Marsh,Knew what?
136,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this - fruity little club!
137,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch!"
138,10,1,Chef,"Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love."
139,10,1,Stan Marsh,"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good."
140,10,1,Chef,I just like to make love up your butt.
141,10,1,Woman Patient,[turns away] Oh my God!
142,10,1,Nurse,"[comes out to get the next patient] Mr. Chef, is it?"
143,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, come on. [they follow the nurse in]"
144,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?"
145,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club."
146,10,1,Dr Neeland,[approaches Chef] Brainwashed.
147,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr."
148,10,1,Dr Neeland,I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.
149,10,1,Stan Marsh,"No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children."
150,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah."
151,10,1,Chef,"Doctor, do you have- children?"
152,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Why, yes, I have two young boys."
153,10,1,Chef,Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
154,10,1,Dr Neeland,You say he's never been like this before?
155,10,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Chef has always been super-cool."
156,10,1,Chef,I'm gonna make love to the children.
157,10,1,Dr Neeland,He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.
158,10,1,Eric Cartman,So what can we do??
159,10,1,Dr Neeland,"I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process."
160,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!"
161,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?"
162,10,1,Stan Marsh,Having sex with women.
163,10,1,Dr Neeland,Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away.
164,10,1,Peppermint Hippo DJ,"All right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!"
165,10,1,Chef,"[a long-haired blonde tries to excite him] Aw, come on, children. Let's go home."
166,10,1,Stan Marsh,This isn't working.
167,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Well let's... give it some more time, kids. [a brunette is keeping him busy.]"
168,10,1,Ragged Stripper,[coarse voice] Would you like to daaance???
169,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
170,10,1,Ragged Stripper,[walks away] Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???
171,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Come on, bitch! Dance!"
172,10,1,Blonde Stripper,"Up yours, fatty."
173,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!"
174,10,1,Peppermint Hippo DJ,"All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spontaneous Bootay! [an immense black stripper walks out, down the runway, and to the stripper pole, stout enough to hold her up. Chef leans his head to the right to get a better look.]"
175,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on guys, we might as well go. [the boys prepare to leave. The obese stripper can move, though, and Chef is interested. He drops the blonde off and approaches the stage]"
176,10,1,Chef,God-damn!
177,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we're leaving."
178,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Nono, wait. Let him go. [Chef moves closer and stands in awe of Spontaneous Bootay]"
179,10,1,Spontaneous Bootay,"[walks up to Chef] Come here, chubby. [buries his face between her breasts and rattles it with them, then turns around and buries his face between her ass cheeks and rattles it with them as well. She releases him from their hold]"
180,10,1,Chef,Wait a minute.
181,10,1,Stan Marsh,He's remembering.
182,10,1,Chef,Children! What have I done?
183,10,1,Eric Cartman,"It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!"
184,10,1,Chef,I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
185,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Chef! You can do it!"
186,10,1,Chef,"I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!"
187,10,1,The Boys,Yay!
188,10,1,Kenny McCormick,(Chef!)
189,10,1,Chef,"Hey children, everybody! I'm back! [a tranquilizer dart flies in on his left side and strikes him under the ear, behind the jaw, and his smile vanishes] Ow."
190,10,1,Mr Connolly,"[The Club is there] Great shot, William! Hit him with another. [William, dressed in outback gear, blows another dart out through a tube. This one lands in Chef's left arm]"
191,10,1,Chef,Oh! [gets groggy quickly and drops like a sack of potatoes.]
192,10,1,The Boys,Chef!
193,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Tally ho, lads! I must say you're starting to become quite a thorn in my balls."
194,10,1,Stan Marsh,Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
195,10,1,Mr Connolly,He's safe. [presses a remote control. The main screen comes on and Chef is shown strapped down to a bed while William sits in a chair at its foot] He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.
196,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!"
197,10,1,Mr Connolly,"We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!"
198,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh Jesus, here we go."
199,10,1,Mr Connolly,Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.
200,10,1,Stan Marsh,We don't wanna hear it.
201,10,1,Mr Connolly,"You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas! [a gregarious man with an open smile in the picture] Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers, [a shot of him climbing up a mountain] but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it. [A shot of Phinehas reaching a summit, only to find two Brits there, celebrating] Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas! [Phinehas with some Australian natives] Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal. [a shot of him with those kids] But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal."
202,10,1,Stan Marsh,Immortal?
203,10,1,Mr Connolly,"He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies. [a graphic of kid bodies appears, and bright dots dapple them and move around] And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos. [a blue monster alien with a bright red crown. Next shot, Phinehas in the gondola of a hot-air balloon with several boys] Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892. [a shot of Phinehas' body on the train's bumper]"
204,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
205,10,1,Mr Connolly,Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?
206,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded."
207,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave. [dramatic fanfare]"
208,10,1,Stan Marsh,We're not leaving without Chef.
209,10,1,Mr Connolly,"If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave. [dramatic fanfare] You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see! [laughs more and more sinisterly. Moments later...] Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?"
210,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,We're not going anywhere without Chef.
211,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome. [the boys do not move] You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security! [two officers come out and stand behind the boys] Take these boys to the door."
212,10,1,Guard 1,"All right, come on kids."
213,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,No! Hey!
214,10,1,Mr Connolly,[the lights come on] Haha! Look they're being led out by security! Haha!
215,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[to one of the guards] No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!"
216,10,1,Guard 2,This is their house and they don't want you here. [about to push Stan out the door. Kyle grabs a bat from a nearby jar and whacks the second guard in the back and the first guard on the legs. They both fall. The boys run towards the Deprivation Room]
217,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!"
218,10,1,"Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire",And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills. [the boys break the door down]
219,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, come on!"
220,10,1,Chef,Children!
221,10,1,"Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire",Get out of here!
222,10,1,Eric Cartman,Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
223,10,1,Kenny McCormick,[launches himself into a spinning projectile] (Yeeeeehah!) [smashes William's groin. William doubles over in pain]
224,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[rushes up to Chef] Come on, Chef!"
225,10,1,Chef,[struggling] I can't... break these locks. [those are solid locks indeed]
226,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Here! [walks up to the fallen William, gets a small ax from him, walks up to Chef and chops the locks open. They escape the Deprivation Room]"
227,10,1,Eric Cartman,Run Chef!
228,10,1,Mr Connolly,[turns to see what's happening] What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!
229,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Get outside! [Chef and the boys reach the front doors]
230,10,1,Mr Connolly,Stop them! [he leads the adventurers in the charge]
231,10,1,Chef,Children! Run! [they run to the other end of the bridge]
232,10,1,Mr Connolly,Stop! [his group runs out of the club. Stan and the others reach the other side]
233,10,1,Stan Marsh,We made it!
234,10,1,Mr Connolly,[calling out] Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place?? [Chef stops in his tracks]
235,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef, come on!"
236,10,1,Mr Connolly,You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!
237,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef? [Chef's hesitance shoes a dilemma] Chef?"
238,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!"
239,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Chef, we love you."
240,10,1,Chef,[his eyes shift back and forth with his thoughts] I'm sorry children. [turns and walks towards the club]
241,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??"
242,10,1,Chef,"Get the hell out of here, children!!"
243,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all. [a fierce flash of lightning tears the bridge in two, right behind Chef. Fire leaps on him and he screams] NO! [The club end of the bridge smashes into the cliff]"
244,10,1,The Boys,"Chef! [Chef tries to scramble up the bridge, but the fire is too fast and consumes it. He can't climb. The club members approach the edge of the cliff. One of them inadvertently kicks a stone off and it hits Chef, knocking him off the bridge and to his doom below.]"
245,10,1,Chef,"Ack. [He bounces off five jagged rocks before finally...] Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit! [...landing on the jagged stub of wood piercing through some rocks, which impales him] Ah- Awww! [blood spreads out under him]"
246,10,1,Stan Marsh,"NO! [Chef struggles to get up, but can't move. A mountain lion leaps down into view]"
247,10,1,Eric Cartman,"A mountain lion! [the lion grabs at Chef's right arm, but is having trouble ripping it off]"
248,10,1,Mr Connolly,We can't lose another member! Shoot it! [the marksman aims and fires]
249,10,1,Chef,Ah!
250,10,1,Marksman,"All right, this! [fires twice, but the lion remains unaffected and continues pulling at Chef's arm]"
251,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,[heartbroken] CHEF! [a huge bear appears]
252,10,1,Eric Cartman,A grizzly bear!
253,10,1,Stan Marsh,Oh my God... They killed Chef.
254,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!
255,10,1,Mr Connolly,Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester. [the men turn and go back to the clubhouse]
256,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Maybe- maybe he's still okay. [the other boys look at him, dumbfounded] No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-"
257,10,1,Chef,"POOOT! [a mean final fart, and a soiled log falls out]"
258,10,1,Eric Cartman,Oh never mind.
259,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go. [the boys leave the precipice]"
260,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days. [Elton John is present] Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us. [Stan, Cartman and Kenny look down at their feet] But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile. [they perk up a bit] I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song. [Timmy and Jimmy are sitting together] I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by. [Terrance and Phillip are present, weeping quietly] So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains."
261,10,1,Randy Marsh,Yeah.
262,10,1,Mr Mackey,He's right. [soft applause rises from the crowd]
263,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. [smiles]"
264,10,1,Mr Connolly,Is it working? Is it working?
265,10,1,Tech,Yes. We've got a pulse!
266,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry! [an ICU suit is fitted onto Chef] We have done it! Good! Raise him up! [Chef and the operating table are tilted upright - but this Chef looks like Darth Vader. He has a glowing red spatula in his right hand] Chef, can you hear me? Say something."
267,10,1,Darth Chef,"Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury steak?"
268,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Yes, go on."
269,10,1,Darth Chef,"And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?"
270,10,1,Mr Connolly,Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy?
271,10,1,Darth Chef,"No, I mean my balls."
272,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!"
