0,10,14,Editor,[The nameplate on his desk says Mr. Jarvis] Being a delivery boy for the South Park Gazette is a noble privilege.
1,10,14,Stan Marsh,"I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day."
2,10,14,Mr Jarvis,"Oh waaa waaa waaa! We've all got problems, pussy! Get used to it! [picks up today's paper] You aren't delivering the papers on time!"
3,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[insistent] My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. [behind him, outside the window, a tow truck pulls up]"
4,10,14,Mr Jarvis,[noticing] Is that your bike out there? [the driver leaves the cab and moves towards the back of the truck.]
5,10,14,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Why?
6,10,14,Mr Jarvis,'Cause it's being towed.
7,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[turns around] What?? [walks to the door and looks out its window, then leaves the office while the driver locks the bike in place]"
8,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Hey, hey! What are you doing?!"
9,10,14,Tow Truck Driver,This your bike?
10,10,14,Stan Marsh,Yes!
11,10,14,Tow Truck Driver,"It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. [the list shows the tow truck belonging to Jerry's Towing. The driver activates the crane, which slowly lifts one end of the bike up]"
12,10,14,Stan Marsh,"No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!"
13,10,14,Tow Truck Driver,Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. [gets back into the cab and closes the door]
14,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[climbs up the door towards the driver] No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike! [the truck moves forward and Stan hops off. He moves towards the bike.] Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! [catches up to the bike and grabs one of the pedals, but that just jerks him up and down a few times as the wheel on the ground moves the pedals. Stan hits the ground several times, getting bruised until he finally lets go of the pedal and rests on the street. He looks on helplessly as the truck keeps moving and his bike disappears in the distance]"
15,10,14,Judge,Yes? Come in.
16,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-"
17,10,14,Judge,"Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job."
18,10,14,Stan Marsh,"I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?"
19,10,14,Judge,"[pulls out a pre-loaded record player and puts the needle onto the record, which begins playing, then says] Stan Marsh is a bright young man. He's got a great family, a promising paper route; only problem is, [removes the needle from the record] his bike's been impounded! [puts the needle back on the record, on another song] But now, he's about to find out that getting his bike back isn't so easy. [pulls the needle off again and puts the needle's arm in its resting place]"
20,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[several seconds later] Look, I really need my bike."
21,10,14,Judge,"[puts the record player aside] Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you, because then you wouldn't learn anything.."
22,10,14,Stan Marsh,What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
23,10,14,Judge,"Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team."
24,10,14,Stan Marsh,...Yeah?
25,10,14,Judge,Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.
26,10,14,Stan Marsh,[apprehensive] Me?
27,10,14,Judge,"[pulls out the record player again and plays it] Stan Marsh is a washed-up fourth grader. He's got no job, no bicycle. And his only way out is to coach... [pulls the needle off the record] a pee wee hockey team! [puts it on again] And now, he's about to find out that to coach, you've got to grow."
28,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here. [the kids move towards him, tumbling. Stan decides to go in and meet them] We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in."
29,10,14,1,Who are you?
30,10,14,Stan Marsh,My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
31,10,14,8,"Coach, I have to go potty."
32,10,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, fine, go ahead."
33,10,14,8,...By myself?
34,10,14,Stan Marsh,"S- hold it a while, okay?"
35,10,14,7,"What does ""passing"" mean?"
36,10,14,Stan Marsh,When you shoot the puck to another player.
37,10,14,15,[chubby boy] My mommy said I'm as big as the sky.
38,10,14,3,"Coach, Wooden spit on my forehead!"
39,10,14,6,I did not!
40,10,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie."
41,10,14,13,"[downcast] I can't play goalie. [he's balk, save for a few hairs hanging down from inside his helmet]"
42,10,14,Stan Marsh,Why not?!
43,10,14,13,My doctor says I'm not supposed to.
44,10,14,Stan Marsh,"What, you got asthma or something?"
45,10,14,3,"No, he has cancer."
46,10,14,Stan Marsh,[off guard] What?
47,10,14,8,Nelson has leukemia. It's already spread to his bone marrow.
48,10,14,13,I don't wanna have cancer! [covers his eyes and begins to weep]
49,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Ah, it's okay. Don't cry."
50,10,14,13,"But why me, coach? Why?"
51,10,14,7,"Coach, why do people get cancer?"
52,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[feeling overwhelmed] Oh Jesus, can we just practice?"
53,10,14,1,"Are we gonna get cancer if we play with Nelson, Coach?"
54,10,14,Stan Marsh,NO! [a rival team and its coach walk up to Park County]
55,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach",Well well well! If it isn't the Park County Losers! [the rival players laugh. They're from Adams County]
56,10,14,7,"Oh no! Adams County! [the Park County players back away, leaving Stan out front]"
57,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","We just thought we'd come check out the ice for the game tomorrow. [steps forward and offers a handshake] Gavin Throttle, coach of the Adams County team."
58,10,14,Stan Marsh,[steps forward to reply] Hey. [Coach Gavin withdraws his hand]
59,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?"
60,10,14,7,Our coach isn't gonna let us lose!
61,10,14,Park County Pee Wee Players,Yeah!!
62,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","[steps forward again] Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!"
63,10,14,Adams County Pee Wee Players,Right! Follow! [they leave the rink]
64,10,14,6,"Coach, please don't let us lose to Adams County. My daddy will beat me again."
65,10,14,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ. [his parents walk up to him]
66,10,14,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!"
67,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!"
68,10,14,Stan Marsh,I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
69,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh, well that's good."
70,10,14,Sharon Marsh,What kind of job?
71,10,14,Stan Marsh,I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
72,10,14,Randy Marsh,"...What? With the-? [turns around] What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago."
73,10,14,Stan Marsh,"I'm not playing, I'm coaching."
74,10,14,Randy Marsh,Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
75,10,14,Stan Marsh,[tense] What are you talking about?
76,10,14,Randy Marsh,Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
77,10,14,Stan Marsh,[relaxes] I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.
78,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!"
79,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[heads upstairs] I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. [Randy moves towards him a bit, but Stan's door closes, and Randy turns to Sharon]"
80,10,14,Randy Marsh,"What are we goin' to do, Sharon??"
81,10,14,Sharon Marsh,What?
82,10,14,Randy Marsh,Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
83,10,14,Sharon Marsh,Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
84,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day."
85,10,14,Announcer,"And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game. [a boy skates towards the camera] And that's # 7, Stan Marsh, skating towards the goal, sort of, but h doesn't have the puck. [players nowhere near him just fall randomly. Two players manage to move towards a puck. The South Park player falls onto the Denver player, who kicks the puck away]"
86,10,14,Denver Goalie,"[farts, and realizes he did more than that] I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em! [leaves the goal defenseless]"
87,10,14,Announcer,"Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants. [the pucks moves towards Stan and stops right in front of him. The spotlight lands on him. The announcer stands] Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal!"
88,10,14,Crowd,Ohhhh!
89,10,14,Randy Marsh,[with longer hair] Stan?? Shoot it! [Stan isn't sure what to do]
90,10,14,Announcer,Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!
91,10,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You got it, Stan!"
92,10,14,Randy Marsh,"[quite animated. Sharon holds him down] Take the shot!! Take the shot!! [Stan takes the shot and the puck moves towards the goal, but stops just inches from success. The buzzer sounds and no one wins] NOOOOOOOOOOO!"
93,10,14,Announcer,"Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing. [Stan looks around, scared.]"
94,10,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, what's wrong??"
95,10,14,Randy Marsh,"OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again."
96,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[blows his whistle] All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice."
97,10,14,A Man,"Coach? Hey coach. [the man and his wife appear] Could we talk to you, please? [Stan leaves the rink to meet them]"
98,10,14,Woman,We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?
99,10,14,Stan Marsh,Oh
100,10,14,Mr Brown,"Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad. [Mrs. Brown tries to soothe him, but begins to weep softly]"
101,10,14,Stan Marsh,Ohhh.
102,10,14,Mr Brown,"Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live? [frustration leads to anger] You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!"
103,10,14,Mrs Brown,"Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach."
104,10,14,Mr Brown,"[frustrated again] No, I don't mean to take it out on you, coach. It's just... [fiddling with his had nervously] I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh?"
105,10,14,Stan Marsh,... I don't know.
106,10,14,Mr Brown,"Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you."
107,10,14,Stan Marsh,"No, I think you oughta."
108,10,14,Mr Brown,"Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him."
109,10,14,Mrs Brown,"Please, coach, he's... [turns aside to cry] he's counting on you!"
110,10,14,Mr Brown,"[bows several times] Please, coach, he's counting on you!"
111,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[enters the room] Oh uh, hey Nelson."
112,10,14,Nelson Brown,"Oh. [coughs] Hi, coach."
113,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?"
114,10,14,Nelson Brown,"Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying. [Stan walks up to him] Coach, what's it like when you die?"
115,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?"
116,10,14,Nelson Brown,How come I have to die now?
117,10,14,Stan Marsh,Ogh.
118,10,14,Nelson Brown,"I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?"
119,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Goddammit, dude, I don't know."
120,10,14,Nelson Brown,I'm sorry.
121,10,14,Stan Marsh,"No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?"
122,10,14,Nelson Brown,I think so.
123,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? [gives him a thumbs up and walks away]"
124,10,14,Nelson Brown,"Thanks, coach. [Stan is close to the door...] Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?"
125,10,14,Stan Marsh,"No- dude, I told you I can't do that."
126,10,14,Nelson Brown,"Well then, will you just... win for me?"
127,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay. [pause. He steps out of the room and closes the door. Behind the door is the judge, waiting. He has his record player with him. He starts playing it...]"
128,10,14,Judge,"Stan Marsh has always lived a carefree life. But in the blink of an eye, what seemed important before can all be put in perspective. Stan Marsh is... ""Bummin' on Cancer."" [takes the needle off, and Stan walks away.]"
129,10,14,Announcer,"Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County. [Sharon walks in and sits down]"
130,10,14,Adams County Pee Wee Players,[Gavin leads them in the cheer] Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!
131,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Gavin] Coach, can I talk to you for a second?"
132,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","Come to surrender, coach?"
133,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[takes him aside] Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?"
134,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no! [turns and heads back to his team] Win! Win! Win! Win!"
135,10,14,Adams County Pee Wee Players,Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ...
136,10,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, guys, listen. [turns around] I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. [the players look at each other]"
137,10,14,6,"Sooo, if we lose we're gonna kill Nelson?"
138,10,14,7,"Oh Jesus, no!"
139,10,14,3,I don't wanna be a murderer!
140,10,14,Stan Marsh,Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
141,10,14,7,If we lose are we gonna get cancer?
142,10,14,13,Oh no!
143,10,14,15,Ohhh..
144,10,14,8,Oh no.
145,10,14,6,I don't want cancer.
146,10,14,7,"They look pretty strong, coach. I think Nelson's gonna die for sure. [Stan looks a bit awed at the kid's assessment. The referee skates up to the center of the rink. Blur's ""Song No. 2"" begins to play.]"
147,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it! [the ref throws down the puck and the skaters move... and fall over] Yeah! Let's go Adams!"
148,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Let's go, Park! Come on!"
149,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","That's it, Brian! Kill him! [motions to Stan, then returns to watching the game]"
150,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Get near the puck! [Park County players fall. No one is getting near the puck. No. 15, the goalie, continues picking his nose. Fast forward to the end of the third period. An Adams County player is struggling to keep his bladder in check. One second left in the game]"
151,10,14,Announcer,And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie.
152,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Tie? Well, what does that mean?"
153,10,14,Judge,"[walks up with his record player and plays it] Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all. The big game. A dying boy's hope. Only problem is, [pulls the needle off the record.] he tied! [puts the needle on another track] And now, he's about to find out that tying isn't the same as winning. [pulls the needle up]"
154,10,14,1,So did we kill Nelson or not?
155,10,14,Stan Marsh,Hello?
156,10,14,Nelson Brown,Coach.
157,10,14,Stan Marsh,How are you feeling?
158,10,14,Nelson Brown,"I feel pretty good, except for the cancer. [coughs] Coach? Does God hate me?"
159,10,14,Dr Doctor,"Oh, hello Coach."
160,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?"
161,10,14,Dr Doctor,"Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied."
162,10,14,Stan Marsh,Oh boy.
163,10,14,Nelson Brown,[coughs] Oh. My cancer hurts.
164,10,14,Dr Doctor,"He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo."
165,10,14,Stan Marsh,But what can I do?
166,10,14,Judge,[rushes into the room with his record player] Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news! Our hockey team has just been invited to play against Denver County during a Colorado Avalanche game!
167,10,14,Nelson Brown,Wow. [smiles] At the Pepsi Center?
168,10,14,Dr Doctor,Look! He's coming around again.
169,10,14,Nelson Brown,"That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?"
170,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Well, ah, I mean..."
171,10,14,Judge,"[sets the record player on the floor and plays it] Imagine. If there was one game, one chance, to make everything right. Stan Marsh is being given that chance. But to win, he's gonna have to pull out all the stops in... ""Stanley's Cup""! Rated R. [turns the player off]"
172,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em."
173,10,14,Nelson Brown,All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
174,10,14,Dr Doctor,"[takes Stan aside] Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays."
175,10,14,6,Coach! What the hell were you thinking?
176,10,14,3,We can't beat Denver County.
177,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Well, sure we can."
178,10,14,6,Last time we played Denver they scored seven times.
179,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?"
180,10,14,8,"No, 'cause they're gonna kill us."
181,10,14,Stan Marsh,They're not gonna kill us.
182,10,14,6,That's what Steve Irwin said about those stingrays.
183,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[thinks a bit] Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end."
184,10,14,3,"No. In the movies, they always go out and find a kid who's really good to join the team."
185,10,14,Stan Marsh,Hey that's right. We need a ringer. [smiles]
186,10,14,13,We need a Canadian. [Next thing you see is Ike shooting pucks into the goal. Stan and Kyle watch. Stan smiles.]
187,10,14,6,"Wow, he's good."
188,10,14,Park County Pee Wee Players,Yeah!
189,10,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous."
190,10,14,Stan Marsh,"It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. [Ike is wearing #2]"
191,10,14,Park County Pee Wee Players,Yeah!
192,10,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan."
193,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago."
194,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now."
195,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again. [sits at the foot of the bed] Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go. [gets up and looks at Stan] I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying ""That's my son!"" [turns around and leaves the room, then turns around again] And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. [turns left and walks away]"
196,10,14,Announcer,"His shot is blocked! What a great save! [a man holds up a banner that reads ""GO AVS."" The buzzer sounds and the score is tied at 2-2 at the end of the second period] And that's the end of the second period. The score is tied 2-all. [the teams go to their locker rooms] And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players."
197,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[at an entrance with his team] All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?! [all the players are with him in their own ways.] All right, let's go win!"
198,10,14,NHL Official,"[rounds the corner and spots them] Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight."
199,10,14,Stan Marsh,Huh?
200,10,14,NHL Official,The other Pee Wee hockey team didn't show up. There's nobody for you to play. Thanks for makin' the trip though.
201,10,14,Park County Pee Wee Players,We came to play.
202,10,14,Stan Marsh,Sso then we win?
203,10,14,NHL Official,No. Nobody wins.
204,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Hey. Hey, you can't do this. [the Avs come up behind Park County] We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!"
205,10,14,NHL Official,"Well, you've got nobody to play, there's nothing we can do."
206,10,14,Stan Marsh,But it isn't supposed to end like this!
207,10,14,Av 1,"Hey, hold on a second. If these kids have been through a lot of emotional changes, then they have to play."
208,10,14,Av 2,Yeah.
209,10,14,NHL Official,"Well, who are they gonna play?"
210,10,14,Av 1,They can take our place.
211,10,14,Av 3,Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.
212,10,14,Stan Marsh,[turns around and face the Avs] Play the Red Wings?
213,10,14,Judge,[pops in with his record player and plays his record] Stan Marsh coaches a Pee Wee hockey team. But now [pulls the needle off the record] they're going to play in the big leagues. [plays his record again] They've got small bodies but big hearts. Stan Marsh is... going professional. [pops out]
214,10,14,Av 1,"All right! Give 'em hell, boys!"
215,10,14,The Avs,All right! Yeah!
