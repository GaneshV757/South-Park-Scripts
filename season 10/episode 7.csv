0,10,7,Mr Mackey,"Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!"
1,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, why would you do such a thing?"
2,10,7,Eric Cartman,I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
3,10,7,Mr Mackey,You know that's not the point!
4,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg."
5,10,7,Liane Cartman,"That's very naughty, Eric."
6,10,7,Eric Cartman,Well he called me chubby!
7,10,7,Mr Mackey,"We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!"
8,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[agreeing] I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like. [reaches into her purse, pulls out a napkin and cries into it] I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day. [crying through her words] He just never listens."
9,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!"
10,10,7,Liane Cartman,"It's not him, it's you, Eric. [Cartman's anger vanishes] I don't know what to do with you."
11,10,7,Eric Cartman,Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
12,10,7,Liane and Eric,"My mom's the best mom, better than your mom.It's singing together in harmony."
13,10,7,Mr Mackey,"Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?"
14,10,7,Announcer,"They're every parent's worst nightmare. [Two boys are in a bedroom. The older boy jumps around on the bed and throws a blue pillow at the younger one, the younger one cries, gets up, and throws the pillow back at him.]"
15,10,7,Girl,[in the bathroom with her father] Shut up! I hate you! I hate you! [runs away. Her father is confused]
16,10,7,Announcer,"Kids completely out of control. [a boy is at the dining table at home, next to a bowl of spaghetti. He picks up the bowl, turns it over, dumps the spaghetti to the floor, and wears the bowl as a hat]"
17,10,7,Boy,"[drops to the floor and slides around in the spaghetti] Look, I'm skating, I'm skating!"
18,10,7,Announcer,"It's time to call Nanny 911. [a silhouetted nanny walks in from the left and into the show's coats of arms. Next shot is a camera zooming into NANNY CENTRAL. Inside the manor the nannies are shown: Nanny Stella, Nanny Deb, Nanny Yvonne, and Nanny Skexis] We've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis. [five kids are on a living room sofa. One kid dances around, another repeatedly bangs an object on the floor, two others throw stuff to the floor] Parents of America, help is on the way! [Cartman is shown finger-painting] Tonight..."
19,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[grabs a can of Red Bull. Several more cans are scattered around, and one of them has tipped over and spilled some drink] Mom, I need another energy drink! [tosses a can away. Next shot, he's in the tub taking a bath and farts. Next shot, he has finished off the tacos his mom served him and takes one of hers without permission.]"
20,10,7,Announcer,This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
21,10,7,Eric Cartman,[from his days supporting Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ: pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets meesed up from the impacts]
22,10,7,Announcer,"And Nanny Stella is selected to set him straight. [Stella, a stout blonde, walks toward Cartman's house, and people take second looks at her. She approaches Cartman's front door]"
23,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! [knocks on the door. Inside, Cartman is playing a video game. Stella knocks again]"
24,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!"
25,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[walks by] Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins."
26,10,7,Eric Cartman,Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. [burps]
27,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,[Liane answers the door] Hello. I'm Nanny Stella.
28,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. [shows Stella in. Stella walks up to Cartman]"
29,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,And you must be Eric.
30,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, I want a Twinkie."
31,10,7,Liane Cartman,"All, all right dear. [starts walking, but Stella stops her]"
32,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done."
33,10,7,Eric Cartman,[glances up at her] Ha! Hahahahahaha
34,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
35,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[mocking her British accent] No thanks, I'd rather naught."
36,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. [takes away the controller, then unplugs and gathers up the rest of the game console]"
37,10,7,Eric Cartman,The hell do you think you're doing?
38,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Come on. [leads Liane and Cartman into the kitchen and sets the console down] This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed. [She walks off. Eric simply grabs the console and heads back to the living room, and she returns] Eric, no! This is not acceptable! [takes the console and sets it back on counter]"
39,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!"
40,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"All right, that's it! [grabs his hand] You're going to time-out! [leads him away]"
41,10,7,Eric Cartman,Time out?
42,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[takes him to a stool and places him on it as Liane watches] Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes."
43,10,7,Eric Cartman,[glances down and thinks] And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
44,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
45,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[looks at her, then hops off the stool] Whoa, how did I do that? [walks off to get his X-Box]"
46,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Eric, you have to stay in time-out!"
47,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Ummm, no?"
48,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[approaches him, takes his hands off the console, and takes him back to the stool] Come on, you don't have a choice."
49,10,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now."
50,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[genuflects and addresses him firmly] Eric, you need to listen to me. [to Liane] This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level. [to Eric] Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?"
51,10,7,Eric Cartman,I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
52,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Well then, I'll just have to stand right here! [Cartman snorts inward, gathering up a wad of mucus and saliva and spitting it at Stella's mouth] Oh! [Cartman hops off and walks toward his X-Box] He spit in my mouth!"
53,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Yeah, it's best to avoid his level."
54,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
55,10,7,Eric Cartman,[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
56,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[genuflects behind him and embraces him] Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?"
57,10,7,Eric Cartman,Because you took my Xbox.
58,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
59,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, yeah."
60,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
61,10,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I guess so.
62,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[to Liane] See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?"
63,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny."
64,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you."
65,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?"
66,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Oh, I just never had kids."
67,10,7,Eric Cartman,Why not?
68,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,It... just... didn't happen.
69,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You're sterile, is that it? [she releases him, taken aback by that question] No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it? [her jaw drops] Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless."
70,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Why you, you... [stands up] you little bastard! How dare you?!"
71,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, naughty."
72,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,What kind of [picks him up by the collar] monster would-
73,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! [Stella drops him and steps back a bit]"
74,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,That's it! [walks up to the camera] I'm not doing this!
75,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, but we really need some help. [Stella steps back to talk to Liane]"
76,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,Find yourself another nanny... television show!
77,10,7,Announcer,"Coming up next, it's Super Nanny! Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through. [a parasol appears in her hand, then the camera pulls back to show three child silhouettes on either side of her. The silhouettes jump up and down]"
78,10,7,Supernanny Jo,This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!
79,10,7,Supernanny Jo,"Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman."
80,10,7,Doctor At Mental Hospital,I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis.
81,10,7,Liane Cartman,What do you mean?
82,10,7,Doctor At Mental Hospital,"I mean, [looks into the nanny's room, 23A] she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. [Liane looks inside through a window. Jo is glued to her toilet seat, eating her own shit.]"
83,10,7,Supernanny Jo,[Through mouthfuls of poop.] From heeell! It's from heeell!
84,10,7,Liane Cartman,Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
85,10,7,Doctor At Mental Hospital,Well there... is... one more show you could still try.
86,10,7,Announcer,"When good dogs go bad, there's one man who's their best friend. Cesar Millan."
87,10,7,Cesar Millan,"No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer."
88,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Please, come in."
89,10,7,Cesar Millan,So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
90,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life."
91,10,7,Cesar Millan,So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
92,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake."
93,10,7,Cesar Millan,"See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him."
94,10,7,Eric Cartman,Not interested I'm me?
95,10,7,Cesar Millan,"See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you."
96,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well I don't see why-"
97,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
98,10,7,Eric Cartman,Hey!
99,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation."
100,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, this guy doesn't-"
101,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
102,10,7,Eric Cartman,Ah! Quit it!
103,10,7,Liane Cartman,What what is it that you're doing?
104,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant."
105,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-"
106,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
107,10,7,Eric Cartman,KNOCK IT OFF!
108,10,7,Cesar Millan,"[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response."
109,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, that's very interesting."
110,10,7,Cesar Millan,I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
111,10,7,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat!
112,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
113,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Well, no, I don't."
114,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Go on, take your son for a walk."
115,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?"
116,10,7,Cesar Millan,"See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along."
117,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, this is degrading!"
118,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
119,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! [begins to strain the leash, but can't get loose. He struggles to escape]"
120,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. [Cartman tries to get loose from the leash, but Cesar reins him back every time. Cartman starts getting tired.]"
121,10,7,Eric Cartman,Maaaa. Mommm. [getting hoarse] Mommm.
122,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. [Liane takes the leash and Cartman goes to her left side]"
123,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!"
124,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you."
125,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?"
126,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cesar is pleased]
127,10,7,Eric Cartman,Mom!
128,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!"
129,10,7,Announcer,"And now, back to the Dog Whisperer."
130,10,7,Cesar Millan,It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
131,10,7,Eric Cartman,[on the sofa to Liane's left] God dammit stop ignoring me!
132,10,7,Cesar Millan,You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.
133,10,7,Liane Cartman,Ahall right.
134,10,7,Eric Cartman,"This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!"
135,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
136,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Quit it, mom!"
137,10,7,Liane Cartman,It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
138,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. [pulls a bucket of chicken out of the bag. He and Liane walk away from the sofa]"
139,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Ooo, Colonel?"
140,10,7,Cesar Millan,"I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. [Cartman hops down from the sofa and goes to the bucket]"
141,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken."
142,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
143,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!"
144,10,7,Cesar Millan,I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. [hands the bucket to Liane]
145,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!"
146,10,7,Cesar Millan,We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
147,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[to Cesar] Goddammit, I am not a dog! [turns to Liane and hops up and down like an excited dog] Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken! [gets shrill] Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!"
148,10,7,Cesar Millan,[observing Cartman] We need him to become relaxed and submissive.
149,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Gih- [quiets down] Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?"
150,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, very good, sweetie."
151,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant."
152,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Suck my asshole, taco vendor!"
153,10,7,Cesar Millan,See?
154,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me! [to Liane] Now hand it over!"
155,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
156,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You can't do that to me, I-"
157,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman sits on the floor]
158,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit, you just can't-"
159,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman is on his back]
160,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Seriously! Ey? Eh... [he's now fully on his back, calm]"
161,10,7,Cesar Millan,I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
162,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Wow, I have a lot to learn."
163,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[sits up, then stands] Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken! [Liane ignores him by looking up and away] That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine! [goes upstairs] I hate you! I'm running away!"
164,10,7,Liane Cartman,Oh dear. [Cartman's bedroom door closes]
165,10,7,Cesar Millan,"It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle."
166,10,7,Liane Cartman,But what if he does run away.
167,10,7,Cesar Millan,Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. [they walk toward the kitchen]
168,10,7,Butters,"[his turn] Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! [he and the dealer Stan exchange money through Kyle. Cartman enters]"
169,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news. [sighs as Kyle takes his turn] I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow."
170,10,7,Stan Marsh,[takes his turn] You can't stay here.
171,10,7,Eric Cartman,Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
172,10,7,Kyle Broflovski,You'er not staying at my house either.
173,10,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you."
174,10,7,Butters,"No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore."
175,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?! [Kenny takes his turn] His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people! [play continues] All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man."
176,10,7,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck you.)
177,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere! [Butters takes his turn] Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! [walks out and shuts the front door]"
178,10,7,Butters,[taking his turn] Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
179,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now."
180,10,7,Jimmy Valmer,Who is your best friend?
181,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other."
182,10,7,Jimmy Valmer,What's my last name?
183,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[tries to answer, but can't, so he leaves in a huff] Goddammit! [knocks on another door and Craig answers] Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets."
184,10,7,Craig Tucker,...But I hate you.
185,10,7,Eric Cartman,...Should that really matter at a time like this?
186,10,7,Eric Cartman,This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
187,10,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, I'm back."
188,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home."
189,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here."
190,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was."
191,10,7,Eric Cartman,That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
192,10,7,Liane Cartman,Cesar...
193,10,7,Cesar Millan,How is the painting going?
194,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw, Goddammit!"
195,10,7,Cesar Millan,Oh look it came back.
196,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Yup, just like you said he would."
197,10,7,Eric Cartman,What is he still doing here?!
198,10,7,Liane Cartman,He said he's hungry. What should I do?
199,10,7,Cesar Millan,Well let's feed it.
200,10,7,Eric Cartman,"What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!"
201,10,7,Cesar Millan,This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
202,10,7,Eric Cartman,Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! [gets off and walks to the phone]
203,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?"
204,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!"
205,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! [they walk up to Cartman, who's ready to dial]"
206,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!"
207,10,7,Cesar Millan,"You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it."
208,10,7,Eric Cartman,"I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-"
209,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
210,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-"
211,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman drops the receiver and sits on the floor]
212,10,7,Eric Cartman,Seriously! Mom-
213,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
214,10,7,Eric Cartman,Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
215,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman is flat on his back]
216,10,7,Eric Cartman,Mom?!
217,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
218,10,7,Eric Cartman,Mom? Mom...
219,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[makes sure Cartman is relaxed, then stands up and turns to Cesar] I did it! [smiles. Cartman doesn't move]"
220,10,7,Cesar Millan,"You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. [Cartman walks by, looking defeated, glances at Cesar, then at his mom, then sits by his mom on the sofa and cuddles up to her, a little warily]"
221,10,7,Liane Cartman,Oh... Oh my gosh!
222,10,7,Cesar Millan,"See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state."
223,10,7,Liane Cartman,He's never done this before.
224,10,7,Cesar Millan,Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
225,10,7,Liane Cartman,"I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. [Cartman sniffs]"
226,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Now you can give him a snack. [Liane offers Cartman a chunk of Candy, which Cartman laps up like a dog] Good, this is really good. Now try a command."
227,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed. [Cartman doesn't do anything at first, then he hops off the sofa and heads for his room, head down] Oh my goodness. I can't believe it."
228,10,7,Cesar Millan,"This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now."
229,10,7,Liane Cartman,I am the pack leader! [grins]
230,10,7,Cesar Millan,Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
231,10,7,Liane Cartman,Sounds divine!
232,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?! [despite his indignation, he looks compeled to follow orders. He gets up on the stool, gets the toothbrush, turns on the cold water, and gets the toothpaste] Jesus. What's happening to me?"
233,10,7,Cesar Millan,"So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?"
234,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him."
235,10,7,Cesar Millan,That's greeat!
236,10,7,Liane Cartman,The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
237,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend."
238,10,7,Liane Cartman,"There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child."
239,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality."
240,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. [places her left hand on his right one - closeup shot]"
241,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom."
242,10,7,Butters,Kill your mom?
243,10,7,Eric Cartman,"She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes."
244,10,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, have you lost more weight?"
245,10,7,Eric Cartman,Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
246,10,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool."
247,10,7,Eric Cartman,"She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?! [rushes away and gets an easel with some schematics on it] All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked. [the plan includes blaming Token for the murder] You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom."
248,10,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're not killing your mom."
249,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face."
250,10,7,Stan Marsh,Where am I supposed to get a gun?
251,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!"
252,10,7,Stan Marsh,I'm not shooting anybody.
253,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face."
254,10,7,Kyle Broflovski,"NO, Cartman!"
255,10,7,Eric Cartman,Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?! [the boys ignore him. He gets pissed off and walks away with the easel] Fine! I'll do it by myself!
256,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son. [Liane moves a bit] You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore! [he moves the knife to a stabbing position] Goodbye, Mother. [about to deliver the fatal stab, he trembles for a few seconds, but his conscience gets a hold of him. Cartman relaxes a bit]"
257,10,7,Cartman s Conscience,Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.
258,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[shakes it off] No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!"
259,10,7,Cartman s Good Side,She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being.
260,10,7,Eric Cartman,She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
261,10,7,Cartman s Bad Side,"No, she's just... out to make you suffer!"
262,10,7,Eric Cartman,Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
263,10,7,Cartman s Good Side,The world doesn't revolve around me?
264,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[hops off the bed, dropping the knife and roll of paper as he heads for the door] Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. [stops and vomits some pretty black stuff. Could be the evil in him]"
265,10,7,Cartman s Good Side,The world doesn't revolve around me!
266,10,7,Cartman s Bad Side,"Idiot! [Cartman pounds the floor and gets up. For a moment he turns into a snowy screen, then into a red silhouette, snowy screen, back and forth as he fights his sides leaving his mom's room and going to his. At his door he turns into a blob, which is added to the silhouette and screen effects until he passes out in the hallway]"
267,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Why Eric, you made your own breakfast."
268,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham."
269,10,7,Liane Cartman,And you're studying before school?
270,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started."
271,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[a tear escapes her left eye] Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you."
272,10,7,Eric Cartman,Tha... thank you?
273,10,7,Liane Cartman,"I love you, sweetie."
274,10,7,Eric Cartman,"'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. [the doorbell rings and Liane goes to answer the door]"
275,10,7,Liane Cartman,Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
276,10,7,Cesar Millan,How is the child doing?
277,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son."
278,10,7,Cesar Millan,"That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too."
279,10,7,Liane Cartman,"You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night."
280,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles."
281,10,7,Liane Cartman,Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
282,10,7,Cesar Millan,"No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. [turns around and walks away. Cartman shows up soon after]"
283,10,7,Eric Cartman,"I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. [waits a bit, then turns to go to his room. Liane turns around]"
284,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?"
285,10,7,Eric Cartman,"No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then."
286,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward? [Cartman blinks, Liane genuflects] And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger."
287,10,7,Eric Cartman,Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
288,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[hugs him] Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. [A beatific smile appears on Cartman's face as foreboding music plays.]"
