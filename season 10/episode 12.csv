0,10,12,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! [his mom arrives]"
1,10,12,Liane Cartman,"There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?"
2,10,12,Eric Cartman,I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
3,10,12,Liane Cartman,When does it come out?
4,10,12,Eric Cartman,Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
5,10,12,Liane Cartman,[takes him by the hand] It's time for school
6,10,12,Eric Cartman,"[yanks his hand away and runs back to the store] No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand."
7,10,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. [pulls him away again]"
8,10,12,Eric Cartman,Noo!! Nooo!!
9,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Principal Victoria, it is wrong! [she's at the principal's office, her back to the principal's desk.] It is wrong and I simply will not do it! [walks back to the desk] I care about my students, and I will not fill their heads with lies! [pounds the desk for emphasis] I am NOT teaching evolution in my class!! [Mr. Mackey is also present]"
10,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it."
11,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!
12,10,12,Mr Mackey,"M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven."
13,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff!"
14,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything."
15,10,12,Eric Cartman,How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
16,10,12,Stan Marsh,It's still three weeks.
17,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh God... [shivers like someone in withdrawal] Okay, how long now?"
18,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,Will you shut up already?! [Mrs. Garrison enters and isn't too happy about her lesson]
19,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution."
20,10,12,Butters,Oh boy!
21,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP. But I've been told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this: [goes up to a large poster of evolution and begins pointing things out with her pointer.] In the beginning we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its [waves his left hand limply] mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this. [points to a rodent] retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you! [faces the class. A new girl is seated in the front row, looking around] So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!"
22,10,12,Eric Cartman,[hopping out of his chair and running out] HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
23,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.
24,10,12,Eric Cartman,Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! [a store clerk notices and walks over]
25,10,12,Clerk,"Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. [he goes back inside, and Liane walks up]"
26,10,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, you're coming home right now!"
27,10,12,Eric Cartman,Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
28,10,12,Liane Cartman,It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
29,10,12,Eric Cartman,Oh God!
30,10,12,Eric Cartman,Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
31,10,12,Eric Cartman,"You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me."
32,10,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude you don't look so good, Cartman."
33,10,12,Eric Cartman,"I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me."
34,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient."
35,10,12,Eric Cartman,[assertively] No. There is something I can do.
36,10,12,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
37,10,12,Eric Cartman,"All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right? [turns around] I think I figured out how to do it."
38,10,12,Stan Marsh,Do what?
39,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me."
40,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,No.
41,10,12,Eric Cartman,"It's simple science, Kyle."
42,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,"You'll die, retard!"
43,10,12,Eric Cartman,I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
44,10,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, no way."
45,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you."
46,10,12,Eric Cartman,"I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! [walks away in a huff]"
47,10,12,Father,"Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!"
48,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,"I told you this would happen, didn't I?!"
49,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-"
50,10,12,Mr Triscotti,"We have worked years to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter, and in one fell swoop, you try to destroy everything we did!"
51,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,I hear ya.
52,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class."
53,10,12,Mr Triscotti,You most certainly will!
54,10,12,Daughter,"But Dad, I want to learn everything."
55,10,12,Mr Triscotti,No you don't! Shut up! [takes his daughter and leaves the room]
56,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,"Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms."
57,10,12,Principal Victoria,It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! [Mr. Dawkins enters the office]
58,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,Re-replaced??
59,10,12,Principal Victoria,Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.
60,10,12,Mr Dawkins,[courteously] Charmed to meet you. Ms...
61,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,"Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class!"
62,10,12,Principal Victoria,You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
63,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. [although all the kids have pencil and paper out ready to take notes, only Kyle is actually writing anything as Dawkins lectures. Mr. Dawkins himself delivers his lecture in a scholarly voice.]"
64,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Whatever.
65,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"[glances over, then continues] It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air."
66,10,12,Mrs Garrison,[relating Dawkin's points to his own] Retarded fish-frogs.
67,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"[a bit shocked] Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification."
68,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Well, you're a faggot! [the look of shock returns to Dawkins.] Continue."
69,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright."
70,10,12,Mrs Garrison,So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.
71,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"[puts the chalk in the holder below the blackboard] Well yes, basically, we are."
72,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people!
73,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!"
74,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?"
75,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist."
76,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"[rises and walks up to him] AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!!"
77,10,12,Mr Dawkins,I never covered it up.
78,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well act like a monkey, huh?! [begins to dance around like a monkey, hooting and hollering. He lowers his pants and poops into his left hand.]"
79,10,12,Mr Dawkins,What on earth are you doing?? [now Butters is the one taking notes]
80,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!! [throws the log of feces at Dawkins and gets him on his forehead and on the left side of his sweater]"
81,10,12,Mr Dawkins,AAAH!
82,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements."
83,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom."
84,10,12,Mrs Garrison,What??
85,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students."
86,10,12,Principal Victoria,Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
87,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?"
88,10,12,Mrs Garrison,What?!
89,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion."
90,10,12,Mrs Garrison,[softens immediately] You d-you do?
91,10,12,Mr Dawkins,I've never met a woman with so much... fire
92,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Well I... [begins preening] I do bring down a woman's wrath now and again. [slight giggle]
93,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful. [snaps out of it] I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-"
94,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead."
95,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?
96,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Well, [preens again] well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something. [Dawkins smiles, Garrison smiles back]"
97,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation! [skips away, towards the front doors] Oh boy, what'll I wear?! [opens the doors and skips out] Hey everybody!"
98,10,12,Eric Cartman,[in the freezer] Ey!
99,10,12,Liane Cartman,"[jumps back in surprise, dropping the ice cream] Whoa!"
100,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!"
101,10,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, get out of there. [tries to pull him out, but he kicks her hand away]"
102,10,12,Eric Cartman,"[resisting all of Liane's efforts] No! No, it's too soon!"
103,10,12,Liane Cartman,"[pulls him out of the freezer] Now Eric, this has gone far enough! [sets him down and goes down on a bended knee] You need to learn to be patient!"
104,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Butters, get your coat. We gotta go."
105,10,12,Butters,Go where?
106,10,12,Eric Cartman,You're gonna help me freeze myself.
107,10,12,Butters,"[looks at Cartman a while, then] Okay. [walks away to get his coat, smiling]"
108,10,12,Butters,"Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?"
109,10,12,Eric Cartman,"[stops and begins digging ] Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away. [finishes digging a hole, tosses the ice pick away, and prepares to step down into it] I have to be hidden. [removes his jacket and gives it to Butters] That's good. [begins to gather the snow around him and then faces Butters, who's shocked at this turn of events] And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!"
110,10,12,Butters,"Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?"
111,10,12,Eric Cartman,"No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea"
112,10,12,Butters,"[not so sure, casts his eyes down] Yeah...I guess it is..."
113,10,12,Eric Cartman,"All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?"
114,10,12,Butters,I got it. [looks around] Big Tree. Oval Rock.
115,10,12,Eric Cartman,"All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed. [Butters looks at Cartman once more, then leaves. Butters turns to look at Cartman again] Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!"
116,10,12,Butters,Oh jeez! [turns around and walks away quickly]
117,10,12,Eric Cartman,[all alone now] Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
118,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"So I told my gynecologist, ""you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!"" [they both laugh at the story.]"
119,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys."
120,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Hehyeah, almost."
121,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist."
122,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff."
123,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?
124,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God."
125,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?
126,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"[Thinks a moment] You're riiight. It's so simple! God is a spaghetti monster. Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened! [stands up] Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!"
127,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Really?? Oh that's wonderful!
128,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!"
129,10,12,Mr Dawkins,You're so welcome!
130,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Would you like tuh... [preens again] head over to my place for dessert?
131,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!"
132,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Oh Ms. Garrison!
133,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!"
134,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do."
135,10,12,Medic,"We have a pulse. [Cartman comes to, coughs, and sits up. The aliens gather around]"
136,10,12,Alien 1,Can you... understand me?
137,10,12,Eric Cartman,Where am I?
138,10,12,Shvek,My name is Shvek. You are safe.
139,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Safe where, butthole?!"
140,10,12,Shvek,"My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546."
141,10,12,Eric Cartman,[looks around] What??
142,10,12,Shvek,"You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years. [Cartman jumps off the bed and runs to the nearest window, where he sees a city unlike any he's seen before.]"
143,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! [suddenly looks tired.]"
144,10,12,Medic,Please be careful. You are frail.
145,10,12,Eric Cartman,Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
146,10,12,Analyst,"[brings up a holoscreen and presses a few buttons on it. A picture of the Wii appears] Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time."
147,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!"
148,10,12,Medic,"Young man, you don't seem to understand. [goes down on one knee] Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years."
149,10,12,Eric Cartman,I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
150,10,12,Shvek,We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
151,10,12,Eric Cartman,No... [looks up at the ceiling and] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
152,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here."
153,10,12,Mrs Garrison,[thinking] That's my man.
154,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen."
155,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God."
156,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-
157,10,12,Stan Marsh,Well there could still be a god.
158,10,12,Mrs Garrison,What?!
159,10,12,Stan Marsh,Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
160,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"[brings out a triangle and starts ringing it] Uh oh, retard alert! Retard alert, class! [leaves her desk and walks up to Stan's] Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!"
161,10,12,Stan Marsh,"I wasn't talking about spaghetti. [Mrs. Garrison picks him up, desk and all, and carries him to the front of the class.]"
162,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair! [sets him down next to the blackboard, goes for a dunce cap, and places it on Stan's head. The cap reads ""I HAVE FAITH""]"
163,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right."
164,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion."
165,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Yes, but to be so bold about it... [looks away] I've just never seen a woman with such... balls."
166,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"[gets up and sits on Mr. Dawkins with the blanket over her chest] You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world."
167,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God."
168,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you."
169,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again."
170,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Oh, all right. [lowers the blanket and the breasts appear. The implants... are not balanced. The left nipple is huge and lower compared to the right one, and the stitches are still visible.]"
171,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm. [begins to shake his head between the breasts, which has the effect of a motorboat's engine revving up.]"
172,10,12,Mrs Garrison,OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!! [Mr. Dawkins revs up again]
173,10,12,Butters,"Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!"
174,10,12,Dougie,[fires at the action figures] Pehpew Pehpew! [walks over and kicks them down]
175,10,12,Butters,Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
176,10,12,Linda Stotch,"Butters? [she appears at the sliding door entrance with two policemen behind her] Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?"
177,10,12,Butters,"[a bit afraid, slowly] Who, me?"
178,10,12,Linda Stotch,"It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?"
179,10,12,Butters,"[looks right, then left, trying to figure out what to say...] No ma'am."
180,10,12,Linda Stotch,Okay. [closes the sliding door and walks away with the officers]
181,10,12,Dougie,"Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! [Butters turns and joins him]"
182,10,12,Butters,"Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?"
183,10,12,Dougie,Okay.
184,10,12,Butters,"Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?"
185,10,12,Dougie,[long pause] ...Yeah.
186,10,12,Butters,"Well, like what?"
187,10,12,Dougie,"...Like, you die."
188,10,12,Butters,...Die??
189,10,12,Dougie,"Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead."
190,10,12,Butters,Oh hamburgers!! [runs away]
191,10,12,Butters,Eric! Erihic!
192,10,12,Dougie,You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
193,10,12,Butters,He told me to!
194,10,12,Dougie,He's dead for sure.
195,10,12,Butters,Wait! [looks around.] It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
196,10,12,Dougie,Oh my God...
197,10,12,Butters,"[begins to dig frantically] Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!"
198,10,12,Dougie,[trying to stop him] Butters ButterButterBUTTERS! [Butters stops and looks at him] We have to get out of here!
199,10,12,Butters,What??
200,10,12,Dougie,"Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! [runs off]"
201,10,12,Butters,But I just did what he told me!
202,10,12,Dougie,"Come on, we have to leave!!"
203,10,12,Butters,Oh jumping Jesus! [follows Dougie. They head back to town]
204,10,12,Eric Cartman,This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. [puts his head in his hands and starts to weep. A door slides open and three of the aliens enter the room]
205,10,12,Shvek,"Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii."
206,10,12,Eric Cartman,What?? [hops onto the desk] Really?? [jumps down and exults] YES!! YES!!
207,10,12,Medic,It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.
208,10,12,Eric Cartman,"So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!"
209,10,12,Shvek,"Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first."
210,10,12,Shvek,"You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason."
211,10,12,Medic,Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.
212,10,12,Eric Cartman,I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
213,10,12,Shvek,"You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist."
214,10,12,Eric Cartman,[strokes his chin and thinks] And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
215,10,12,Medic,We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.
216,10,12,Eric Cartman,Who? [the medic is about to reply when something shakes the building they're in]
217,10,12,Shvek,"What in Science's name was that?! [outside, an enemy ship first at the building and leaves a hole in it. The ship docks at that hole and the invaders pour into a cargo room. The UAL members and Cartman enter the cargo room at the other end.]"
218,10,12,Medic,Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!
219,10,12,Shvek,"Oh Science, help us! [a laser battle between the two groups begins]"
