0,10,2,Gerald,"Hey there, Richard!"
1,10,2,Richard Tweek,"[stops shoveling snow and stands up] Oh, hey Gerald. New car?"
2,10,2,Gerald,Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and- [closes his eyes as if to banish bad thoughts] be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
3,10,2,Richard Tweek,Well... Good for you.
4,10,2,Gerald,"Oho... [gives a thumbs up, closes his eyes and says with a slight falsetto] Thanks. [drives off and back into town, where Mr. Stotch and Mrs. Garrison observe him drive by]"
5,10,2,Stephen,"Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski."
6,10,2,Mrs Garrison,"Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else."
7,10,2,Gerald,"You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment. [begins to drive away, with his eyes closed] Thanks."
8,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! [a quite-satisfied Gerald stops at the next intersection. Another hybrid car pulls up alongside him]"
9,10,2,Driver,"Hey, is that a hybrid?"
10,10,2,Gerald,"Oh yes. You've got one too, I see."
11,10,2,Driver,"Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway, [sticks his thumb up through the passenger window] good for you!"
12,10,2,Gerald,[sticks up his thumb in return and begins to drive away with his eyes closed] Thanks.
13,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[firmly] Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. [Ike's eyes are half-closed and he's getting woozy]"
14,10,2,Gerald,"Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot."
15,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
16,10,2,Gerald,"Okay, there's another one. [smiles and looks up after posting a citation on a green car] Aw, man! Look at that! [walks two cars over] Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick! [begins writing up a citation] ""Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"""
17,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[catches up] Dad, can we go home, please?"
18,10,2,Gerald,"Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!"
19,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"But Dad, I want-"
20,10,2,Gerald,"NOW, KYLE! [Kyle's eyelids drop and he goes to write the citation. He and Stan cross paths]"
21,10,2,Stan Marsh,Oh hey Kyle.
22,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?"
23,10,2,Stan Marsh,Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
24,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,[his head drops] Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. [Randy reaches his red SUV and notices the citation on his windshield]
25,10,2,Randy,What's this? [takes the citation and reads it]
26,10,2,Gerald,Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
27,10,2,Randy,"A ticket? ""Failure to care about the environment"" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!"
28,10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-"
29,10,2,Randy,"You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!"
30,10,2,Gerald,"Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket."
31,10,2,Randy,I know it's not a real ticket!!
32,10,2,Jimbo Kern,"[approaches] Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! [Randy crosses his arms]"
33,10,2,Gerald,"Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon."
34,10,2,Jimbo Kern,"[crumples the ticket into a wad and throws it down] Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!"
35,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, let's just go!"
36,10,2,Gerald,"Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem."
37,10,2,Randy,"The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!"
38,10,2,Gerald,"Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was ""high and mighty"" to [closes his eyes] care about the earth!"
39,10,2,Randy,And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
40,10,2,Gerald,"Well, I really don't see how [closes his eyes] that has anything to do with the-"
41,10,2,Randy,"There, like that! Stop that!"
42,10,2,Darryl Weathers,Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck!
43,10,2,Gerald,"All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! [they walk away, and Ike bounces along]"
44,10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away."
45,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks into the kitchen with Ike] Dad. [his parents turn to face him] Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you."
46,10,2,Gerald,"[closes his eyes] Yes, it certainly is."
47,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... [rolls his eyes]
48,10,2,Ike,Take offense.
49,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... [rolls his eyes again and cues Ike]
50,10,2,Ike,[slowly] Alienated.
51,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
52,10,2,Gerald,"Well, I totally agree, Kyle."
53,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,You do??
54,10,2,Gerald,Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
55,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Righ! [grins] Okay, good."
56,10,2,Gerald,"And that's why, [hugs Sheila by the shoulder] I've talked it over with your mother, and [releases the hug] ...we've decided to MOVE!"
57,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,What??
58,10,2,Gerald,"We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! [grins. Kyle and Ike look stunned]"
59,10,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah? [the door opens and Butters enters]
60,10,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle."
61,10,2,Stan Marsh,Going away party? What do you mean?
62,10,2,Butters Stotch,Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
63,10,2,Stan Marsh,[jumps off his chair and looks at Butters] Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
64,10,2,Butters Stotch,Well he is.
65,10,2,Stan Marsh,Where's the going-away party?
66,10,2,Butters Stotch,At Cartman's house.
67,10,2,Eric Cartman,[walks into the living room with a pitcher and cups of pop] Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! [blows into a noisemaker and makes it stick out. Other kids walk up and take cups away]
68,10,2,Token Black,"Hey Eric, where's Kyle?"
69,10,2,Eric Cartman,Who? [smiles innocently]
70,10,2,Clyde,"Kyle, the person leaving."
71,10,2,Eric Cartman,Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
72,10,2,Craig Tucker,"Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!"
73,10,2,Stan Marsh,[enters the house and the other boys move a bit] Kyle? Kyle!
74,10,2,Clyde,Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.
75,10,2,Stan Marsh,What?!
76,10,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! [Stan leaves]'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!"
77,10,2,Stan Marsh,Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
78,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
79,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend."
80,10,2,Gerald,"I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs."
81,10,2,Stan Marsh,Well... Maybe they'll change.
82,10,2,Gerald,"[puts a small box into the trunk] I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! [Kyle and Ike head towards it]"
83,10,2,Stan Marsh,Nooo!
84,10,2,Gerald,"[opens the back right door, and the boys climb in] Maybe you can make a difference, Stan. [closes the door] Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day, [walks around to the driver's side] we're just gonna have to be [closes his eyes] with our own kind. [gets in and begins to drive away. Stan steps into the street and watches them go]"
85,10,2,Stan Marsh,I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
86,10,2,Gerald,"Well? What do you think, huh? [the boxes are present, but as yet unpacked]"
87,10,2,Sheila,"Oh Gerald, it's beautiful."
88,10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. [some neighbors stop in]"
89,10,2,San Francisco Man,"Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors."
90,10,2,Gerald,Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.
91,10,2,San Francisco Man,"Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis [sucking on something purple] So how do you like the neighborhood?"
92,10,2,Sheila,Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
93,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis","Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to [closes his eyes] keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down."
94,10,2,Man 2,"[approaches the front entrance] You in here, Peter?"
95,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis","Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis"
96,10,2,"Paul McDonahue, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan","Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan"
97,10,2,Gerald and Sheila,Hello.
98,10,2,"Paul McDonahue, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan","We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?"
99,10,2,Gerald,Yeah. That's right.
100,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis","Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series [closes his eyes] Its emissions are actually cleaner."
101,10,2,Gerald,"Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?"
102,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis","Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco. [farts, then bends over to take it all in, then stands up again] Ahhhm. [licks his lips to savor every last bit of fart] Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here."
103,10,2,"Paul McDonahue, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan","Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest. [farts, then bends over to take it all in as if it were oxygen] Ahhh, [sniff] ahh, [sniff] ahh. [stands up] We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco"
104,10,2,Gerald,Yeah. We sure are.
105,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, people. Come on, people now. [Cartman and Butters enter]"
106,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing?"
107,10,2,Stan Marsh,"I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways."
108,10,2,Eric Cartman,"THAT's gay, heh."
109,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!"
110,10,2,Eric Cartman,Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
111,10,2,Stan Marsh,"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow."
112,10,2,Eric Cartman,"[fears that for a moment, then] Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! [walks out]"
113,10,2,Butters Stotch,Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. [walks out after Cartman. Stan resumes composing]
114,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, people. Come on, people now."
115,10,2,KXUV DJ,"All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with ""Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already"". [Stan's intro begins to play]"
116,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now."
117,10,2,Customer,He's right. [people leave their cars and go to a Toyonda hybrid dealership]
118,10,2,Stan Marsh,"We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now"
119,10,2,Mrs Tucker Craig s Mother,"Hey Jimbo, you got a hybrid too?"
120,10,2,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, I just wanted to [closes his eyes] try to set an example, you know?"
121,10,2,Mrs Tucker Craig s Mother,"Yeah, I guess it's up to us to [closes her eyes] show everyone the way.[opens them] Good for you!"
122,10,2,Jimbo Kern,[cheerfully closes his eyes] Thanks. [drives off]
123,10,2,Mrs Garrison,Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? [pets her own hybrid]
124,10,2,Randy,"I know! It's like ""Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"""
125,10,2,Mr Mackey,"Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?"
126,10,2,Driver 1,"[eyes closed, thumb up] Good for you!"
127,10,2,Driver 2,"[eyes closed, thumb up] Thanks!"
128,10,2,Randy,"[eyes closed, thumb up] At least we're smart enough to know better!"
129,10,2,Driver 3,"[leans out and looks back, eyes closed, thumb up] Thanks! [the street is now filled with hybrids]"
130,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, everybody be people now"
131,10,2,Speaker,And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country! [the crowd cheers]
132,10,2,Richard Tweek,If only the rest of the country [closes his eyes] was as insightful as we are.
133,10,2,Stan Marsh,"[steps up and holds his trophy] Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. [steps down and walks off the stage. The crowd cheers]"
134,10,2,Jimbo Kern,Great speech!
135,10,2,Gerald,"Yeah, well, you know my son is just [closes his eyes] a little bit more clever than some."
136,10,2,An officer,"[stops Stan as Stan steps onto solid ground] Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song."
137,10,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
138,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,Uhh! [smacks Stan on the left cheek enough to spin his head around]
139,10,2,Stan Marsh,Ow!
140,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!
141,10,2,Stan Marsh,What?!
142,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,Come with me! [walks off. Stan follows]
143,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,There! Look! [a dark brown cloud is showing hovering over the town]
144,10,2,Stan Marsh,Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
145,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!"
146,10,2,Stan Marsh,Smug?
147,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!"
148,10,2,Announcer,This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!
149,10,2,Anchor Tom,It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?
150,10,2,Keenan Williams,"[at the weather desk] Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning. [a map of Denver and surrounding areas] All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country."
151,10,2,Singer,A smuggy day in San Francisco town.
152,10,2,"Paul McDonahue, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan","Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?"
153,10,2,Sheila,"No! Hello, how are you?"
154,10,2,Gail And Brian,"Really good, really good. [she farts and quickly bends over to inhale it all]"
155,10,2,Gerald,"Hey there. Alan, right?"
156,10,2,Alan,"Actually, it's Alain"
157,10,2,Gerald,"Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?"
158,10,2,Alan,Can I just get an empty glass?
159,10,2,Gerald,Oh. Sure. [hands him an empty glass]
160,10,2,Alan,"Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death. [puts the glass to his ass and farts into it, then lifts the glass to his nose and inhales deeply]"
161,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,[hesitant at first] So... what do you do for fun?
162,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis",We drink and take drugs.
163,10,2,Boy 1,Do you want some acid?
164,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff."
165,10,2,Boy 2,You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.
166,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis",It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.
167,10,2,Gerald,"Everything okay in here, Kyle?"
168,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fine, Dad."
169,10,2,Gerald,"So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys? [farts, then bends over and inhales his own fart] Wuhh [sniffs, rises and walks away] Mmmm."
170,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
171,10,2,Ike,I want three.
172,10,2,Stan Marsh,"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!"
173,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!"
174,10,2,Butters Stotch,"[giggles] Yeah. You're right. [Cartman stops for a few seconds, then drops his controller]"
175,10,2,Eric Cartman,"You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew."
176,10,2,Butters Stotch,"Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-"
177,10,2,Eric Cartman,"No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!"
178,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,[barging in] Marsh!
179,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly."
180,10,2,Eric Cartman,Who?
181,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!
182,10,2,Keenan Williams,"I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here. [a satellite map is shown, with a closeup window over it. There's smug everywhere] This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength."
183,10,2,Eric Cartman,[clearly doesn't know what's happening] The smug?
184,10,2,Keenan Williams,"The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here. [points to the smug over the California-Nevada border, near Reno] These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other. [moves his hand over the hurricane-like formation over the Nevada-Utah border] Now take a look at this. [moves his hand towards Southern California. A small cell is moving northward]"
185,10,2,Stan Marsh,What is that?
186,10,2,Keenan Williams,It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.
187,10,2,Stan Marsh,George Clooney's acceptance speech?
188,10,2,Keenan Williams,"Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction."
189,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!
190,10,2,Stan Marsh,What about San Francisco?
191,10,2,Keenan Williams,"[with gravity] Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco."
192,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Soo, that's it people. [a different map showing the various smugs is shown, with an arrow going from Clooney's smug to the center of the super cell] When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen."
193,10,2,Randy,Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
194,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. [the crowd grasps, then people begin talking about it]"
195,10,2,Jimbo Kern,This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
196,10,2,Randy,"Yeah. Good going, stupid!"
197,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town."
198,10,2,Stephen,Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! [the crowd responds vigorously to the plan]
199,10,2,Jimbo Kern,Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! [Stan turns left and walks away]
200,10,2,Randy,"Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!"
201,10,2,Stan Marsh,[stops and turns to face the crowd] I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
202,10,2,Randy,Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
203,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?
204,10,2,Keenan Williams,Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.
205,10,2,Attendant,"The hell is that? [The cloud goes over the station. As it goes over, clips of George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech issue from within, ending with ""Oscar winner, George Clooney, sexiest man alive""]"
206,10,2,Butters Stotch,"Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this."
207,10,2,Eric Cartman,[puts on the gloves] I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
208,10,2,Butters Stotch,But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
209,10,2,Eric Cartman,"You don't know San Francisco, Butters. [zips the suit up] It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old. [turns around and sighs] I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me. [reaches down, picks up the helmet, and puts it on, locks it in place, and pressurizes the suit. Communication resumes through the intercom] All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength."
210,10,2,Butters Stotch,"[adjusts his headset] I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric."
211,10,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm not doin' it for Kyle. [turns around] I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. [begins to walk slowly and deliberately into the city]"
212,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!"
213,10,2,Stan Marsh,Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
214,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?! [The green hybrid is now over the masher, and Stan releases it. Moments later, a cube of twisted green metal slides out and drops onto the ground] Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!"
215,10,2,Keenan Williams,"They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!"
216,10,2,San Francisco Man,"Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan."
217,10,2,Eric Cartman,"[checking in] Butters, are you there?!"
218,10,2,Butters Stotch,"[making sure the cord is taut] I'm here, Eric."
219,10,2,Eric Cartman,I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
220,10,2,Butters Stotch,[now reading a map] You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
221,10,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
222,10,2,Butters Stotch,"Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west."
223,10,2,Eric Cartman,Turning right at O two four niner. [turns right at the corner and continues walking]
224,10,2,Randy,That's it. That's that the last one.
225,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!"
226,10,2,Keenan Williams,"Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside! [the townsfolk hear the warning and run around all over the place. Keenan says softly, deeply] God help us."
227,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!"
228,10,2,Butters Stotch,"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!"
229,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!"
230,10,2,Gerald,"[Slowly, blissfully] Being smug is a good thing. [farts in his armchair, bends down to inhale it]"
231,10,2,Eric Cartman,Oh my CHRIST! [runs up to Kyle's room and kicks the door open. Kyle and Ike are as wasted as Gerald and Sheila are. They sit on the floor with their backs against Ike's bed] Kyle? Kyle!
232,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls."
233,10,2,Ike,I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.
234,10,2,Eric Cartman,"[trying to shake Kyle to his senses] We have to get out of here! Now! [lightning strikes the house, which begins to burn. The lights begin to flicker, and the camera zooms in on Cartman, who continues shaking Kyle] Kyle! Kyle!! [the screen goes black]"
235,10,2,Network Anchor,"And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole."
236,10,2,Stan Marsh,No...
237,10,2,Randy,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend."
238,10,2,Clyde,"Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!"
239,10,2,Stan Marsh,What?
240,10,2,Clyde,It's a miracle!
241,10,2,Stan Marsh,Kyle!
242,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Stan.
243,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what happened?? [grins]"
244,10,2,Gerald,We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
245,10,2,Mr Mackey,"It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? [Butters looks to Cartman for any reaction. Cartman puts his left index finger to his mouth, indicating that Butters should keep his mouth shut about this]"
246,10,2,Stan Marsh,"[gives Kyle a brief hug] Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead."
247,10,2,Richard Tweek,So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
248,10,2,Randy,"Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars."
249,10,2,Gerald,"And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? [everyone seems to agree and discusses it...]"
250,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
251,10,2,Mr Mackey,"But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?"
252,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do. [silent reactions all around] Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it."
253,10,2,Randy,You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
254,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
255,10,2,Randy,I'm... [puts his hands over his lower belly] I'm not ready...
256,10,2,Gerald,I don't think I can do it either.
257,10,2,Mr Mackey,It's simply asking too much.
258,10,2,Randy,"Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us."
259,10,2,Gerald,"Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! [everyone likes the idea; they all disperse]"
260,10,2,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle] Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?"
261,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I guess so."
262,10,2,Eric Cartman,"We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!"
263,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! [turns and walks away angry]"
264,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Ah, that's better. [smiles]"
